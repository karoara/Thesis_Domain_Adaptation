0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	12
0	alas we have the entire locomotion set but the cute little mobile wo n't fit our sleigh style crib i called babies r us to see about some sort of conversion kit but there 's no such thing i 'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead	12
0	i think the mobile is very cute but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly i tried attaching it in several differnt places i am going to return it	12
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	12
0	i don not like these washes at all the scent is very very overpowering ! ! ! ! ! i had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong i do love the case though it is sturdy and has lots of room	12
0	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy you need it to be digital and use digital spread spectrum \( dss \) technology 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor though here 's why it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2 4 ghz devices this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones the correct arrangement should be baby monitor 900 mhz digital spread spectrum \( dss \) wifi netowrk 2 4 ghzcordless telephone 5 8 ghz digital spread spectrum \( dss	12
0	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment although the monitor is sensitive and clear moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	12

0	we had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart i chose this one because of its features and colors my daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it we tried for days to get her to use this but she never would so we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves	12
0	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy i will say our child is a bright out going 8 month old now but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea but began to realize that many of the bright gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system it is loud to wear and not so comfortable you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening good luck if you choose to purchase but just think einstein was fine with out one	12
0	i love this swing because it goes side to side she can sit when awake lay down when asleep and once you put her in she is out cold after 6 weeks of using it i thought the battery was going but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high two weeks later it just stopped working i've only had it for two months and hardly use it just a total of 3 hours a day give or take a few	12
0	leaking slipping ca n't use over the kitchen sink horrible design	12
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12

0	i bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money the items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard this would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store pass	12
0	we ordered one it did n't work well it seemed great but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind based on all the reviews we thought we must have had a defective one we ordered a replacement but it seems to have the same issues very disappointed	12
0	i have had this swing a little less than 2 months i bought it for my 5 month old because she would n't sit in a traditional swing and i thought this looked like a comfy place to nap it was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up i called fisher price and the part is on backorder til mid may i guess i just got a lemon because everyone else 's seem to be fine i am truly disappointed in fisher price they usually exceed my expectaions i paid 150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it	12
0	this seat is a great concept it just does n't stay together very well i took it back to the store and they marked it as defective for a few dollars more i got the healthy care booster seat from fisher price i 've had much better luck with it	12
0	i bought this seat for my fifth child she loved it at first but then about the second week we had it the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as i was putting her in it luckily i had not let go of her yet because the whole thing fell apart on the floor the rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks upon investigation the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover material failure i will not buy anything else from this company not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous	12
0	this product just does n't have much variety my baby 's both are completely bored in it and have only used it a handful of times they are 5 months and 1 year she like noise makers and squishy toys but these are all hard boring toys at least to my kids	12
0	for all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age it actually had potential even in the very beginning our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake we tried tightening it to her as much as possible and she still scooted down it after a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether maybe our baby was just too squiggly but honestly i just found it dangerous i think it is a great idea but the product needs some work	12
0	our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges would n't stay in place i love the idea but it just did n't work for us	12
0	i got this as my older son 8 had the regular type of wedge this one does n't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back nor does he stay at the same height on it every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges this to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard i was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it but have been very disappointed with it 's performance also the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month there 's an indentation where i laid my son	12
0	we received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago \( i was registered at babies r us \) my first child used it for a little over 2 years my second child has used it for nearly 2 years neither child is big \( in fact one is rather petite \) even though the mattress was not abused it cracked and ripped in numerous places i'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from kolkraft i do n't recommend this mattress	12
0	i bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the tear resistant cover material all she does is sleep on it !	12
0	we had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter well it is alot quieter than our monitor but like others said it makes this awful beeping noise ! it has gone off twice in the middle of the night before ! we also have another digital phone so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel i would look elsewhere for another monitor the beeping is what gets to me i dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night !	12
0	we had the fisher proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital this was the one we picked in our price range we had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it until there was some weather changes every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound ! buy the sound a lights for 15 and save the extra money ! !	12
0	this monitor is awful i have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1 it makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times like 2 am ! ! ! do not buy this monitor the onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking ! ! !	12
0	this is the worst monitor ! i thought being digital monitor it would be great i was totally wrong ! i could n't even get it to work ! do n't waste your	12
0	this was the worst monitor we have ever had and we have had several with our kids it says the range is 600 feet but it does n't even reach 200 our cordless phone reaches twice the distance the light makes it very annoying at night it beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently !	12
0	this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector we even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor do not but this	12
0	i agree with rebecca bravados are more simple more flexible and more comfortable	12
0	this bra is very comfortable once on getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with the star rating is only for comfort 0 stars for function	12
0	i have seen this product \( and others similar to it \) as an rn we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the cuteness of items that are geared only to be sold not to be useful although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful and some essential it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately in this way you can check for quality and longevity put together your own kit	12
0	this was given to me as a gift and although i have used it it would not be my first choice in infant care the nail clippers are mediocre at best i understand they should n't be sharp for an infant but i have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son 's nails the syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers could n't pull a hair out of my head they have absolutely no grip i have never used the brush comb or toothbrush \( i have others \) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering ! the case is cumbersome and of poor design everytime i open it everything falls out !	12
0	i have small hands so i actually ca n't grip this product with one hand it slips right out because there is no hole the items are okay really do n't like the nail cutters though and they do n't stay in there places i'm sure there are better kits out there	12
0	the nail clippers hairbrush and comb are great but i did not care for the rest it would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company	12
0	the thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper but it is very blunt ! ! ! and the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible unless baby 's nail is very very long if i wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing my 3 month old would have scratched his face and head i end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy that worked much better	12
0	this item is too small i kept putting it on the back windshield but it kept falling down each time i could not see my baby in this tiny mirror not worth the money at all	12
0	i will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed ! they need to repackage items like this for shipping it it the second and the last item of this type i will order online the other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed i have complained before but never get a response too bad too as i like amazon	12
0	this was the only gate on the market that i could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area it stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and i kept having to redrill holes i was a bit angry ! ! ! ! i suggest predrilling your holes ! ! ! the hinges also wo n't stay on and the swinging gate does n't line up you need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you do n't always have 2 hands free ! by the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out	12
0	this product was a big disappointment for us our baby was always covered in sweat after sleeping on the polyster based sheet he was most uncomfortable in his sleep and his back would be wet with sweat definetly not recommend this one	12
0	before i even had the opportunity to use this product it has disappointed me i have washed this item per the manufacturer 's instructions the bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled i wonder how many more washings this pad can stand truly a disappointment	12
0	this is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice i thought ooh what a nifty idea a head bumper ! the whole idea was great but if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine then the head bumper guard is a waste i actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers do n't ask me how he did this the good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	12
0	looked nice at the store thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch until we got home and tried to use it the head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat the velcro is not strong enough i would not buy this product again	12
0	i ordered a kidco elongated child gate a recommended extension needed to be purchased the wrong extension was sent i needed g24 model and received 24 extension for a different model	12
0	i thought tiny love products were good so i bought this the first one i received had the water leaking out the second one does n't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying my baby seems to like it but it does not live up to what it advertises	12
0	i like the music but we have to have it on auto to play because i have a mirror in the seat to see my son \( he is still backward facing \) i ca n't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on also i have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim so just music plays there are plenty of other smaller items that can do that this thing also eats up batteries like you would n't believe i am changing them every couple of days and we are n't in the car much what a disappointment ! ! good concept but does n't work well at all	12
0	frustration is how i sum up my experience with this product on the front cover and with the directions on the back there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock however after opening the packaging there was no key there were four locks alright and lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in despite the product 's claim to be the only child lock that does n't require tools with how the packaging is designed i do n't even think there 's room for the key which makes me wonder do you have to buy the key separately \? i'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy	12
0	if your baby has fingers or teeth this is not a trap they can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee	12
0	for the first couple of weeks the snack trap worked perfectly after that my daughter \( 7 months old \) figured out how to remove the top \( it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware but easily removed \) and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping throwing or shaking the snacks all around the house on the positive side the flaps for the top are very soft and when she does reach in there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers if only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on then this would work perfectly as it is my daughter loves it but we hate cleaning up the mess	12
0	it worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his cheerios everywhere i tried it a few more times after that and got same result the lid is way too easy to remove	12
0	we are training and really were looking for a useful aid it did n't work for us allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated we will continue to use it with our younger child in hopes of avoiding a diaper leak through accident	12
0	i bought two for my kids' seats they constantly bunch up and slip around now i have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund do n't bother with these just fold up a towel it will be cheaper and just as convenient as these things	12
0	this product is absolutely useless save your money the first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it in addition there 's no way to attach it to the carrier stroller or whatever so when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it all it does is slide around so it 's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout	12
0	i ordered this item based on the great rating it got yet when i received it i was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong i ordered a medium based on the manufacturer 's notes yet when received found i needed a longer one after researching how to return since it came with no information on this i found out you can not return this product from this store i wanted to warn everyone before they purchase	12
0	i do n't care what other reviewers say but this bed rail sucked ! ! i used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed it took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed and it would constantly come unlocked and if i buy another bed rail for our next child it wo n't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty i ca n't remember if this cover was removable or not if it was i'm sure it would have been a pain in the a to remove	12
0	if you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation this item is not for you since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her she was bored to tears \( literally \) every time we put her in the lounger \( the baby faces the ceiling not too exciting \) i thought it was a cool concept however my daughter did not she did much better in her papasan or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to but have the option to look around and play as well looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter	12
0	i received this sheet and was immediately disappointed the quality is very cheap and it was n't a perfect fit i am surprised that this is made by graco usually their products are good i would not recommend buying this i would buy a regular crib sheet instead	12
0	this sheet is cheap ugly and scratchy instead buy a portable crib sheet they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors they are softer and more durable	12
0	just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions i find the customer reviews a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on grandma needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything ! thanks to all of you again !	12
0	i do n't have an abundance of money but i would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better i do n't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets from what i understand these are the only sheets that fit the thing so i guess i'm just out of luck hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon	12
0	why bother with a boppy cover when it does nothing to protect the boppy from spit ups and poop accidents \? it 's not practical to throw the boppy in the was each time this happens i can only imagine how stinky this boppy will soon get	12
0	the product says that around 20 weeks you should be able to hear the baby 's heartbeat well i'm 30 weeks now and i still ca n't hear the baby 's heartbeat while using it it was a total waste of money	12
0	does n't dry your bottles at all it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely i give it one star for all the stuff it holds but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it	12
0	we bought this item because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else we had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it we have to attach it back on not very durable	12
0	save your if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller on a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side i did n't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like i thought it was going to either i would not recommend this product it 's very cumbersome when i returned it to the store there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently	12
0	too big and bulky to sit easily on top of the canopy it may be my stroller \( maclaren quest \) that it the issue but i wish i never bought this product my baby hates it too because she ca n't see where we 're walking to	12
0	i love this product in the fleece but this is so light weight it defeats the purpose	12
0	we should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them \( eventually cancelled one \) we would not recommend this item after only one wash \( despite having followed the laundry instruction \) it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore	12
0	i would not recommend this crib mattress pad i followed the washing instructions prior to first use and the pad would not fit on the mattress when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore luckily amazon took it back	12
0	i loved this mattress pad when i first opened it it 's made of soft natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby however after washing it i found it 's too small for the crib mattress which is a standard size i think they just skimped on material or did n't pre wash it 's a good 2 inches too short ! it does n't have much stretch to it so i'm afraid i wo n't be able to use it all ! very disappointing	12
0	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small big mistake it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old i'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version	12
0	well i just tried the bundle me \( toddler size \) with my 20 month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and i am disappointed because it is definitely already too small he really ca n't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent which he hates plus when i have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller \( the only way i can get him in at all \) then it only zips to just above his waist definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly i 'll keep the bag for baby 2 but i'm really disappointed i ca n't use it with my not quite 2 year old	12
0	tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed ihave a product from nano bags that beats this one in construction and comfort this was nice only received as a gift but nothing more washed poorly disappointed	12
0	the tubbly bath dispenser fit our spout just fine but minutes later it would work itself off we tried everything to get it to work with no luck fortunately the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging do n't even try it it 's not worth it ! look for something else there are other faucet covers out there	12
0	pinched my daughter 's tush \( even though it was opened all the way it bent as she was getting on \) she never went near it again have to be very careful as child is sitting down	12
0	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
0	this seat is very dangerous and set my daughter 's potty training back months the seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it ! thank goodness i was still holding her ! she did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after ! potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse ! the only reason i gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one	12
0	i just logged in to see this item 's price so that i could price ours for the consignment sale neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time and this did n't help that at all	12
0	sometimes it works ok sometimes it stops swinging for no reason sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music it always makes a gringing noise when swinging if it worked like it should it would be a great product i like the stars projected below when they work	12
0	when i ordered this product i was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it i was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it this happiness only lasted two days before the mobile lights and music stopped working i am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product i have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby	12
0	for the price of this cradle swing i 'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than i got first the stand seemed a little wobbly you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they do n't lock into an optimal position even worse however is that after less than two days of use the lights sound and mobile stopped working calls to customer service were a complete waste of time and i ended up returning the item while the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable i 'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive papasan cradle swing	12
0	i got this toy for my brother who is 4 the buttons were hard to press the stickers didnt stick it used many batteries and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal save ur money ! buy something else	12
0	i though it was just me but after reading several other reviews i see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble disassemble the locks are impossible the items do not quite fit right and it would be impossible to get this thing into its travel bag the mattress is thin and very lumpy each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps i bought this product thinking i could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co sleeper aspect but there is no way i recommend you avoid this product !	12
0	i do not like these bags the twist tie closure system is cumbersome the bags are small the plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen the only advantage i can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly	12
0	these bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom the fold down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff i lost three bags of milk due to leaks if you have to transport the bags anywhere like back and forth to work like i do i would avoid these bags they just leaked all over the place for me even after i carefully re sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions i would recommend the lanisoh bags over these	12
0	the idea behind these bags is great you can pump straight into the bag and store them the execution however is lousy using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying i prefer the lansinoh bags with the double seal even though you ca n't pump straight into them sealing them is quick and easy	12
0	i love my medela pump in style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful the twist tie closure is complicated they also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing i recommend the lansinoh bags they have an easy to use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it 's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing you can also lay them flat to freeze so they wo n't take up much space in the freezer they pour great no spills !	12
0	well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem cause i mean when you buy it you already know that ! lolmy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not every time i would put it on her she would scream and beg me not to put it on it was really heartbreaking on the plus side this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me lolwe used it a couple of time and put it aside she really hated it and i felt that it caused more tention than it is worth	12
0	i did n't even get to use this pad it fell apart in the washer the first time i washed it the vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle \? \? \? \? \? \? what 's up with that \? what good is it to have a mattress pad that you ca n't wash \? total waste of money i am taking it back today ! !	12
0	unfortunately you are correct these are not the same premium heavyweight cloth diapers that used to come from gerber when i called the company \( i use these cloth diapers in my business \) to ask they told me this was the same product it is not they quilt and wrinkle after one washing and just do n't hold up their shape in general amazon needs to update their site because the packaging has changed as well i miss the old diapers !	12
0	the item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve i ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completleydifferent diaper these are thicker better quality and have blue stitching and gerber stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers the diapers i got were thinner plain white and had no stamp buyer beware ! you will not get what you see in this current photo	12
0	i started using these for cloth diapering with my first child they hold plenty and have held up pretty well the ones i hav n't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years ! these are n't as great as chinese prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail these are the best diapers sold in stores	12
0	after trying almost every bottle i tried these and waht a nightmare ! there are to many parts to clean and they leak ! i called dr brown 's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it you have to stir it as most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula i saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them i went with the playtex natural disposables and never looked back	12
0	i thought this product would be helpful for sleeping since it was recommended from a friend however it does n't work for me i took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag after trying it for 5 minutes i decided that i did n't like it and tried to return it the company would only issue store credit because i opened it what a rip off	12
0	my baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing she cried everytime we put her in it it really does not provide a full swing motion she tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction	12
0	i tried fisher price 's take along jungle swing then this open travel swing in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way finally i bought the fisher price aquarium swing i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place \( so it wo n't fold over on baby \) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	12
0	i got this swing and i will be talking it back i put it on 5 and it will not move i do n't know what it would be like with the baby in it i just tryed it	12
0	we bought this about 6 weeks ago and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off basically i believe minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product not recommended at all i would prefer some other brand	12
0	i'm currently in the process of adopting my son and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited it never worked it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up needless to say it 's been sent back i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing	12
0	the warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up so much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping ! had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off	12
0	i tried this swing then this fisher price 's open travel swing in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way finally i bought the fisher price aquarium swing i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place \( so it wo n't fold over on baby \) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	12
0	what more can i say \? these bottles leak all over the place i switched to dr brown 's and they have been great no leaks and my son spits up less do not buy avent bottles and nipples they leak like crazy and cause a huge mess	12
0	this does not fold down 90 deg do n't buy if you think you 'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something	12
0	i was really disappointed in this sealy ultra it does not feel like a very good mattress we 'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better i 'd say you need to see the mattress decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet	12
0	i purchased this item from target and had to return it to the store the wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam and the foam is inserted into the cover the foam is n't the problem it 's the cover the zipper goes right down the middle so it ca n't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head neck i would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece if the zipper were on the side the product would be great	12
0	i bought this thermometer when my second son was born thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money my husband and i tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was we both got 5 different readings i did n't see what the need of the plastic covers were for since we ran out of them quickly \( not to mention you ca n't find replacements anywhere \) my biggest complant was that after a month the product completely stopped working even after changing the batteries i would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer	12
0	i bought this item in preparation for my first child i tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time from 94 2 102 3 ! ! i returned it the next day do n't bother !	12
0	every single time the reading is way low around 94 9 or something like that it is extremely unreliable do n't waste your money	12
0	i bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born it is awful ! it gives strange readings like 94 5 and 95 1 when in fact i know that she has a fever ! i bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings do n't buy this its a waste of time and	12
0	this thermometer is not very accurate or consistant whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and i knew that it could n't be right we would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice i even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95 1 ! we got rid of this one because fever induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate it has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best	12
0	i bought this to take my infant 's temperature since she does n't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm i decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate and it never gave the same reading twice first it was 95 5 and then 98 5 and then 96 2 etc i tested it on myself my daughter and my husband then i gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe i just was n't doing it correctly and he had the same results i have taken it back to target and am trying a different brand do not waste your money on this product	12
0	i use this at work where i have infants up to toddlers we have to repeat the process 3 times before we ever get an accurate reading the under the arm old traditional thermomaters are better	12
0	i loved this at first but after two months of daily use the thing broke i cant get it back together i think i will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside	12
0	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin i wo n't ever use it again	12
0	do n't bother it does n't fit at all ! ! ! ! ! ! plain and simple just do n't bother	12
0	okay maybe i should have read the laundering instructions which say to machine wash and then drip dry but who makes baby items that ca n't be machine dried \? how many parents have the time to line dry delicates \? the upshot is that this fell apart melted in the dryer and got fluff all over everywhere the first time we ever washed it if you need something you can throw in the washer dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting this is not your product grrr	12
0	i bought this for an older model graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it the mattress measures 27 x 39 and before washing it my husband and i tried it out to see if it fit it 's too small i know it 's supposed to be snug but the mattress wo n't even lay flat with this sheet on it it seems like it 'd be a great product if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly	12
0	my son is 8 months old he has outgrown his infant car seat and is now in a larger seat but still rear facing i bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat it does not help in this regard at all in fact it just annoys him i have taken it off the car seat entirely and i'm not using it at all very disappointed in californi	12
0	it started loosing air after just a few uses i was so excited when i ordered the item but now i'm extremely mad	12
0	the biggest disappointment was that after 6 months the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole maybe in the seams \( thus patch would not work \) kel gar does not warranty the product and the store that the tub came from \( via amazon \) only offered a 90 day warranty also the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub the rest flows behind it thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill	12
0	we ordered a tub from baby because which was delivered then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered on route the formula fell off a ups truck and was lying in the street for over a day a neighbor saw it and gave it to us baby because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it we expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day they said it was n't our concern and to just give it back	12
0	i just received this product after much research and i am really disappointed with it 's quality the mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby and the sheets provided are like an emory board scratchy and stiff my baby is too long for this so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres i just thought it would be much better than this looks like i will be returning it my daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce	12
0	buy the baby bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk no matter how i tried i could n't wrap my baby to where i felt he was secure and safe and comfortable plus it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me by the time he was in he wanted out	12
0	a great idea but very time consuming to put on my advice is to use a regular maya type sling for the first few months and then get the patapum it 's the least pricey of the structured carriers which are the only ones that put the weight on your hips rather than your shoulders and therefore spare your spine	12
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we	12
0	you have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria especially if you are wiping then put your hands back in to get another wipey	12
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose if you use these mats the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents don't buy !	12
0	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better	12
0	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid and then the room starts to smell like baby poop yes you can use reg bags for it the only about it first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable	12
0	i also had the older diaper champ and it broke so i got this new one new and improved ! i do n't know if they 've ever tested this product it 's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the diaper champ it 's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips ! it 's absolutely horrible product new or soon to be moms do not buy this ! !	12
0	this step stool is a safety hazard the sides are not angled enough so a two year old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over in fact the stepping surface is so small that it 's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it and when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs	12
0	my baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor please use caution with this toy ! the toy was n't being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted there was no reason for the toy to fall apart	12
0	i bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it doesn't fit at all ! if you are using just for home sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but do n't get it for travel as it does n't work for that	12
0	my son used this several times wet all over the floor each time there is no splash guard on it for boys but it probably works fine for girls	12
0	i bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet we have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar it is not ! it has not fit on any public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place she does n't want to use it which leaves me with nothing ! i would not purchase this product	12
0	not good for larger houses ours picks up radio signals sometimes	12
0	we went through three of these before we finally gave up our poor baby was crying and we did n't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night i luckily am a light sleeper also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near we bought a cheaper safety first brand and have not had any problems	12
0	while sometimes this works well i'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that was n't there when i went to bed it does n't matter what channel it 's on i also get a random drumroll sound frequently if you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap then i highly recommend this	12
0	all i could hear was the local am radio station and even that wasnt clear spend some more money and get something better	12
0	i never got to use this sheet i pre washed it and put it to dry on low heat as i 've done with all the baby clothes i later saw the label said to air dry which seems ridiculous for something that 'll be washed so often anyway it shrunk and does n't fit over the co sleeper mattress if you have time space to air dry it it 's probably a fine product	12
0	this product is great but do not buy it from bp medical you cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund they charge a 15 restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase	12
0	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing	12
0	same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review they sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set and will not honor the same price for the bedding set i have to send it back and they will give a refund what a hassle	12
0	baby age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set refusing changing it to the crib set i have to return it by amazon a z guarantee wasting a lot of time	12
0	i bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay my son pees over the top of this plus it being on is n't to comfortable for an adult 's back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often the whole on it is also pretty small	12
0	i bought several versions of the bundle me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit ! i am so frustrated by this ! why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe \? \? \? we took our car seat to the katie cares safety check today and they took all of the accessories off we had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe save your money and buy a version that goes over the seat and baby not under kidopotomus makes one	12
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light if i were to do this over i would buy a different infant seat	12
0	i heard lots about the avent brand while pregnant and registered for all avent bottles boy am i glad that someone gave me soothies and parent 's choice anti colic bottles too ! ! the nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them she loves the other two brands and i love the parent 's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot do n't waste time or money with avent !	12
0	we did read the directions and the product still works sporadically my wife is a physician ! the leaking problem is incredibly frustrating especially when the baby is crying buy anything else you will be very disappointed especially at this price point	12
0	my seat is brand new and i love it but it has already quick working i 've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly it wo n't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes very disappointed	12
0	shoppers beware the item itself is a great item but i have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders 1 even though the item is advertised in amazon as new i received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time the rocker seat was dirty and smelled 2 even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out 3 some of the accessories are missing and i can bet the previous owner forgot to return them	12
0	my husband and i recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy the noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby we were greatly disappointed	12
0	we loved this toy when my daughter received it for christmas she loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself ! this morning i looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty ! the water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections ! it 's not exactly fixable so we will move on to another crib toy	12
0	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock but lo and behold it only lasted a week our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib so when he kicked this the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one ocean wonders or the one we got flutterbye dreams which he loves	12
0	i bought the baby einstein sea crib toy based on its look i brought it home put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds i was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds i had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music i took it back and purchased the fisher price aquarium and it is great it plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable	12
0	we asked for 2 of these and got both the material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer it was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet it was easy to put on mainly b c it was a bit big they ended up in the closet in no time	12
0	i recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back they say they 're fitted but they are n't elastic so they 're not that well fitted they are paper thin apparently graco has n't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality ! i purchased the koala portable sheets which were cheaper thicker and truly are fitted with elastic ! do n't waste your money on these	12
0	we got 2 of these and had the same problem with both the cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package after washing it as directed it has gotten even worse it has strings hanging all over it it 's a very useful item but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! a friend of mine had the same problem and she recommends the especially for baby brand \( less expensive and better quality \)	12
0	i washed the cover for the first time and it did n't hold up the ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band attaches to the terry also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else i washed with it i'm extremely disappointed with this product	12
0	i loved the gate so when i moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate i needed the extension it was well worth it my daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway i am also happy that we got to re use the hands free gate because i would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall this gate was a great purchase	12
0	an ok gadget but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well it does not have an automatic shut off so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	12
0	i love the other sleep sacks you can see my full review of them on their web pages but this sack has different fabric which i really really do n't like it is n't actually quilted it is woven to look like it is the material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off it also catches on any hang nails or rough skin when it is warm i use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold i use the fleece \( polyester \) ones great sacks just annoying fabric with this one	12
0	this tub is a waste of money i bought it this evening and i'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery unsafe floor very unsatisfied with this product	12
0	this tub was great in the beginning it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all it was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while i was washing her etc however after using the tub about 10 times it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside basically the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled she was n't hurt but was very scared keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs so i do n't think her weight was an issue	12
0	at first i really liked these until i realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week it 's not easy to squeeze the air out since i keep track of how much our baby eats how can i do that when the liner is all scrunched up ! not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out i'm sorry i ever bought them	12
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old i could barely zip it around b c it is so small i keep checking the tags to make sure i got the right size and not the infant one i looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem it 's a great product for smaller children	12
0	ditto to other complaints wo n't separate easily either by unscrewing or prizing cheap flimsy leaks water also because no gasket i'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice this almost identical to product by munchki	12
0	this product is a good idea however 1 the fill hole is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray 2 ca n't be put in the micro 3 extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean 4 extremely hard to open and close \( i and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open \) 5 not good for a grandmother 's hands that has joint problems 6 does n't keep food warm for very long perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product	12
0	maybe in time i will figure this plate out but i cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart use the suction clean it out it may seem simple but a harried mother needs these details ! i am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me at least as far as being a stay put dish which is why i purchased it	12
0	well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it so she decided not to sell it to me so i never got this car seat i really do n't understand why i need to write a review on it	12
0	after seeing the latest consumer reports article on infant car seats i immediately replaced my britax companion with a graco snugfit the britax had previously been highly rated but the latest test trashed it we were surprised becuase it is the first seat we have owned \( on our 3rd kid \) that really was rock solid snug once installed i bought a graco snugfit and i have nothing good to say about it no matter how tight i got the straps attached to the latch in my 2006 honda odyssey i could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort for now i'm sticking with the britax	12
0	i bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car i thought the lights and music would distract him after about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing i have decided that i would really rather hear my son cry it is far less irritating the remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work what genius engineered that \? also it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes do n't waste your money ! !	12
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries waste of money !	12
0	these are a complete waste of money the nipples flow too fast for a newborn i tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding she also swallowed so much air i was burping her for what seemed hours the bottles are too expensive for just storage you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for 3 99 personally i like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer they take up less space	12
0	do n't bother with these they are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary it is much easier to buy storage bags if you are pumping full time you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time i also found that i did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby 's belly and the result is gas or worse colic they also flow too fast for newborns	12
0	i had this when my daughter was first born it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up in it when she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped luckily i had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything i was able to return the product but i bought the snugli carrier instead i would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles	12
0	this sling was very difficult to use i could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious i used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back it was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and or purse so that just added extra weight do n't waste the money i would much rather have another front back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a lot safer the only things i did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci 's keys money and cell	12
0	we bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived we had previously used a diaper genie that we no longer had it worked fine but was expensive we decided to buy the diaper dekor because of the odor free guarantee do n't buy it the guarantee or the pail ! it stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it we have kept it in the garage and also outside not convenient refills are expensive and worse yet my one year old can get dirty diapers out of it through the top or get the bag through the door in the front ! ! ! who designed this thing \? \? \?	12
0	i 've bought this tub thinking that i can just fold it up and store it under the sink but that 's not how it works it take many steps to fold and unfold it one of them ivolves inflating the seat ! the mechanism for snapping it in place when it 's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times also the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things probably not very pleasant for a little baby i am returning this item	12
0	my infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds it is not a well designed blanket	12
0	this product is nice at first but you 'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you do n't have to put anymore holes in your home i 've bought 5 of them over 4 years we have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking do not buy buy something better and higher quality so that you wo n't have to replace in 6 months please listen to this review it will save you	12
0	we had better luck than some the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out called customer service and they said it is n't a replaceable part too bad it was easy enough to install and worked well up until it did n't anymore the click is pretty loud we found ourselves trying to close it two handed to avoid waking up the baby disappointed it did n't last as long as we needed a gate but my daughter is only 2 1 2 and i still need a gate at the top of the stairs i'l be replacing it with a different product obviously	12
0	like so many others have said this was a great gate right up until it broke each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place we are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use each time a gate has broken we 've pondered what to do because we do n't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs argh ! ! !	12
0	this gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke ! the company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty they will not even let you buy a replacement part they want you to buy a entire new gate what a rip off ! do n't buy this gate it is a piece of trash	12
0	the baby bjorn is a nice carrier i received one for my baby shower however i hardly used it i thought i would use it a lot but i found i hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much before that the many straps made me afraid i was going to drop the baby but probably the same problem for other carriers i was really surprised by how little i used it since i really wanted to carry my bab	12
0	i would n't let my dog sleep on these sheets they are of the worst quality imaginable we took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit perfectly i recommend the koala baby name brand porta rib sheet they are available at bru and have elastic all the way around making for a snug fit and the quality is 1000 times improved over the pnp sheets	12
0	do n't buy this sheet ! ! it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it i have a much better solution for you buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack n play they are a couple of less and are sold as especially for baby \( which is b r us house brand \) they are great i use them for both my son 's crib and for the pack n play they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern	12
0	the swing was easy to install and i did not need extra tools or help unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal it was even enough however and i put my daughter in the swing was tilting a little far forward but i could not adjust it the worst part was getting her out the tray was near impossible to undo from its locked position i guess i did not need to worry about her falling out i was just wondering if i would be able to get her out at all i 'll be donating the swing	12
0	we received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery it worked the first time but never again ! i repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working it just would not turn on ! ! ! ! ! i asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period i then sent a email to the first years explaining the situation and never received a reply lousy product !	12
0	i should have read the reviews i purchased this item and it quit working after a week of normal use	12
0	i have this and have used it for about 5 months i have never had problems with it starting but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation i am looking for a new sterilizer because of this i do not recommend	12
0	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago a week ago it just stopped working i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore so i went out and bought the exact same steamer i used it for 2 days and then on the third day yesterday it would n't turn on anymore i'm taking it back today and getting something else	12
0	we too had problems with turning the sterilizer on the unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed but several presses got it to work a couple of times after about 6 uses it died completely not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever \( like an electric kettle \) is exactly but these guys found it this unit also left a lot of condensation in the stuff we sterilized	12
0	i accidentally ordered this one instead of the kolcraft universal carrier since they are both called the universal carrier this car seat carrier is over engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary rather than returning it my husband wanted to eat the 59 99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat we went out and purchased the kolcraft universal carrier it is much simpler easier to fold and has a large functional basket underneath the car seat	12
0	i wanted something thick and soft so my baby could n't feel the plastic under his sheet this one is so thin you can almost see through it there is hardly any quilting another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on it is a safe fit and washes well i ment to give it 3 stars	12
0	my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night honestly the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they did n't move their arms so perhaps the designers had no children of their own	12
0	my baby slid both down and off the side of this i thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base rather it acted as a swivel and i found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner i am involved in a sids research study and this product alarms me ! she could have suffocated ! i am trying to contact the company to report this item please do not buy	12
0	i had been told that these were wonderful to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back but my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides this worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach	12
0	i thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son 's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept the first night we used it my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports he was horrified that our son could have suffocated this was after i had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits i suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby did n't move at all	12
0	this wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight the screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks the rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom i have another wipe warmer by dex that does n't seem to dry out the wipes and i have never seen rust	12
0	i am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all therefore i would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation i liked the concept of this item and it was comfy i had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working i would not recomend this pump at least not to adoptive mothers the customer service was awesome though ! ! ! they were understanding and helpful i eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela	12
0	we have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough the double has the same issues it 's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind	12
0	i have the safari tt dbl jogger from in step and i bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non existent i have seen this product work well on single strollers but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid 's faces i 've used a binder clip to keep it in place but it still blows back more than i think it should	12
0	this was the worst sunshade ever ! ! ! do n't waste your money it is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all we used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies i do not recommend this product i only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option	12
0	i just bought the dora folding potty seat today at walmart it does n't cover the entire toilet seat it starts at the front of the toilet and does n't go all the way to the back the result is that there is no support in the back my daughter is 3 yrs 4 months and this seat is much too weak for her any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back i'm afraid that if we use it it will soon break and she 'll fall in she definitely ca n't sit back or even sit straight up because it sinks so much i'm returning it and i'm going to look for something else	12
0	its a great price but its very small its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small there 's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it	12
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit waste of money	12
0	the size stated 3 6 months the baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small anyone ordering should consider it runs very small then because i used my credit card to purchase it i was unable to return it and get a refund	12
0	had to return this item it was way too small forewarned when you order that it wo n't fit an average baby up to six months i would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most ! ! it is very cute and would be a great addition to a bundleme \( cover \) but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing more disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a 9 item	12
0	it 's a waste of money you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet if not do n't buy it	12
0	this seemed like a great idea but it does n't work very well for cloth diaper users like me i use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs however since my cloth diapers wo n't fit into the diaper organizer i'm not sure what to put there because of this there is a lot of wasted space i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers	12
0	our daughter loves the mobile she laughs every time the peek a boo leaves open to reveal the animals unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds the sound is also very soft	12
0	this stroller is way to heavy too long steering is very difficult and too bulky it is huge when folded try something else	12
0	monitor itself works fine but not if you plan on using the ac adapter fisher price customer service recommends that the ac adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and or unit will be damaged in my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the ac adapter you 'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing ! \( the fisher price rep actually told me i 'd fry it \)	12
0	this monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it also it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet \( from our daughter 's bedroom to the kitchen \) i would definitely not recommend this product and had i not lost the receipt i would have returned it	12
0	i was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes the ad said universal fit well it fit but second size up car seats are taller and kind of lean back when you attach the canopy it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun a hat better serves my child then this aparatus it now sits in the garage with all the other failed baby devices	12
0	the seat is fun to play with but that is also the problem my son was so distracted with the features and songs he never sat still long enough to go to the bathroom	12
0	my son hated this mat at first then he played in with it for about 5 days after that it got old ! mighty quickly my son is now about to make 5 months old and he does n't even want to look at it waste of money for me	12
0	i got so excited when i saw this tummy time mat my enthusiasm was hedged when i read that the water pouch needed to be emptied daily if had known that little detail i would not have registered for this mat i must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together bummer honestly now i am skeptical of any tummy time mat i think my boys prefer a brightly colored patterned blanket toys within reach and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs better off spending the money elsewhere	12
0	i was initially very happy with this product we purchased it to transition our 2 year old to a double bed however the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use since i liked the product i thought maybe i did n't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one it too broke so i'm now looking for a sturdier alternative	12
0	i bought this for my son who was just over 2 years old at the time within about 9 or 10 months the railing broke at the plastic hinge obviously since this is major stress point for the product it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue i was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	12
0	there are so many other sling out there do n't waste your timeor money on this i hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot it was also impossible to adjust i got a couple of slings from www equanimitybaby com and one from www peppermint com and love these bottom line check out the other options this one is a waste of	12
0	this is by far the worst sling i have ever tried ! the padding is bulky and hot it is impossible to adjust total waste of money i bought a pouch from www equanimitybaby com and it was perfect ! easy to use and very comfy the bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk if you ca n't use this sling its not you its the sling	12
0	i think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams he is an easy going fellow but he has n't liked being held to closely he wants his freedom and this does n't give much freedom to a newborn also the quot training quot video is more of a promotional advertisement i had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it	12
0	a friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter the walker itself is wonderful but the light and sound feature is just the worst as others have said it dies after about 2 months and the battery is non replacable my daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and i ca n't stand it ! if you buy it do n't get it for the music lights they will let you down	12
0	i would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks the walker seemed great for the price it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it unfortunately the design is terrible on the sounds n'lights feature it began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it after much frustration trying to get to the battery compartment to replace it we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all the internal battery is soldered in place once it loses it 's original charge you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby	12
0	if you research the toxic gas theory for crib death \( which has been around for 15 \? years \) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can this product is not safe at all no matter what they call it get a babesafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby and use only 100 cotton on top of that \( between your baby and the mattress cover \) do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 cotton blankets run from this product	12
0	the breathe safe padded sheet also left a mesh imprint on my baby 's face placing a sheet over the breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine 1 \) untying bumper guard moving it out of the way2 \) struggling to pull out heavy mattress from crib3 \) removing washing sheet mattress pad4 \) wiping off mattress with soap water5 \) replacing sheet mattress pad6 \) returning heavy mattress to crib7 \) re arranging dust ruffle8 \) re tying bumper guardother than that it seemed like a good idea searching for a better product	12
0	this worked great for a couple months then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise the gears must be slipping my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying really sad	12
0	i bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective ! after a few days they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down this product is a piece of junk	12
0	this is a very cute bouncer chair however i feel it was poorly designed it sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys in addition our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far we had to find one that set more upright	12
0	these bottle leak they 're expensive and you ca n't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over ! do n't waist you 're money they 're a pain to wash too many pieces and they just plain leak after 9 months of using them i'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else plus even with the top on if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything	12
0	this machine is not loud enough i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine \( made by lifewise \) in my boys room my boys sleep through anything the dog the door bell whatever it is but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house	12
0	this was way too quiet even on it 's loudest setting my infant did n't benefit from it at all the sounds are fine and not too repetative as with some machines but even in a small room \( really small \) i found it too quiet to be effective	12
0	i bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well this thing does n't have a white noise sound but i thought maybe the womb sound might work however the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer it 's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds	12
0	the ac adaptor and sound selections are great but the sound is way too low even on the highest level i foolishly bought this knowing that others thought it was too low but it really is so low you ca n't hear it 4 feet away turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me	12
0	my 8 1 2 mo granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night i 've got the correct bumper pads etc but babies do move she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset i 've only had the crib 1 week she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer	12
0	i have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together ! i have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter 's other contraptions i guess i 'll have to sic my husband on it	12
0	very poor construction and does not fit most sleigh cribs as advertised on the box this company should be ashamed of themselves for charging 70 for this product the concept is a good idea and could be so much better but this company fails in execution tots in mind definately has something in mind however it is not your tots buyer beware	12
0	the crib tent did not fit our crib it 's not deep enough or long enough i called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned i am very disatisfied with this company and the product	12
0	bought this crib tent after reading all the fine print about returns besides toilet seats etc which allegro medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons allegro medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days not when i tried to return this allegro medical said all returns were up to their discretion they would not allow me to return this despite the fact i did n't even open the box very misleading will never buy from allegro medical again	12
0	the aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son the nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails i use my own revlon clipper especially since i am comfortable with the feel of it already the thermometer is sooo slow i get make an educated guess faster the case is cute and i am sure the medicine droppers are ok have n't needed those yet but all in all i threw half of this kit in the garbage	12
0	the one star is for the bag it comes in you can take these things along with you but honestly how many of these things will you really need \? maybe just two of them the nail clippers and the bulb syringe i have the set given to me as a gift i say just buy these things separately it 's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you it 's more practical than buying this whole set	12
0	i was so anxious to get this and when i finally did my daughter was just not that interested with it she barely plays with it i was hoping that with this she would spend more time on her tummy because she normally hates that maybe that 's why she did n't care much for this	12
0	i bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats i like the scalloped edges the pillow and the colorful pictures but i am disappointed in the playmat overall the pat mat leaks so bad that i ca n't use it the playmat is cute but it is n't functional not to mention way overpriced the arches have netting which i think freaks my son out he has never liked this playmat i have a square one that he seems to enjoy more	12
0	we bought this product so that i could see my 6 month old son from the front seat but everytime i put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face the blinds do n't stay up either their suctions do n't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door	12
0	i was very disappointed in this liner it seemed like such a great idea but i could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath once the water level rose so did the liner we ended up returning this product to amazon	12
0	i brought this gift for my son and his wife their daughter was born on 2 21 07 when i questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer they just did n't get around to using it i insisted they read the directions and start using it the next day my son stated wow mom this is the best baby shower gift they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked how much timed it saved them as new parents and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time my son was so thankful that i insisted he use the product	12
0	i have tried several types of pads and these are the worst ! they are very small thick and do not hold much causing them to overflow and leak i 'd recommend the gerber pads	12
0	i have no idea why these itch but i have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use ! i have n't had that problem with any other brand and will not buy these again i'm not continuing to wear the ones left in the box i have but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills	12
0	i will not buy these again they are tiny thick and do not tapper on the edges this means you will see the lines thru your shirts the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela they cover more are thinner and stick better	12
0	i went through an entire box in two days ! the fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly plus the diameter of these are much smaller than any others try gerber or lansinoh	12
0	i used these pads when i first started nursing they did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes however my nipples were incredibly sore when i took my baby to her first appt the pediatrician suggested cloth pads what a difference ! yes they did cause me to leak through a little but that was needed when all the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms do n't use these buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath \( i use the imse vimse \)	12
0	if i could rate it no stars i would let me tell you that my son is now 8 and is perfectly normal especially as a baby but i 'll tell you what you don't need a microwave technically they are dangerous for the fomula the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it hard shake then your all set it 's that easy do n't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula	12
0	i got this sterilizer because of the avent name my main complaint is that the lid does n't lock into the base when closing you have to use alot of power for it to close i have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock	12
0	sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well same pillow but the fleece like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual luxury more comfortable for mom and baby wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it 's still like new in another class from the chintzie alternatives offered at other stores	12
0	these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing ! i bought two of these one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside i constantly have to cut the strings \(	12
0	i was very excited to try out this tent at the beach we got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him one of the supports had broken it was the first time i 'd used it i was very disappointed	12
0	i received this as a gift and loved it at first but after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up i was bummed too because i loved it so much if you do buy it be careful when you handle it it 's not as durable as it seems	12
0	we cannot get the refill bags into our diaper dekor plus are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit \? the lady in the store said no so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills now we cant use any of them what should we do	12
0	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too tight bag over the cartridge the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single use item but at about 30 40 a pop it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment the printed instructions were clear it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do	12
0	some assembly is required i consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things i have an engineering degree i 've put together bikes furniture installed car stereos and this thing was an absolute pain especially for such a simple device i found the instructions to be woefully inadequate i found the images to be useless and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps like how to orient various pieces together takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance it was aggravating enough to make me go straight to amazon upon finishing to leave feedback i did n't even buy it from amazon the gate itself is fine	12
0	i purchased this potty for my son i thought that the royal turns would give him an interest in using it it did n't he used it once and cried ! he would not sit on it again i was very disappointed the potty would sing for now reason sometimes and every time you would touch it i do not recommend	12
0	did not work at all ! had to return it ! we prefer the tinkle toons potty with a moisture sensor the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work	12
0	my husband and i were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born he has been using it up to now and i used it this week for the first time our daughter is 9 1 2 months and 21 pounds it was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone the problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain i have after just a two mile walk ! ! ! i ca n't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk ! ! ! i would never recommend that someone buys this !	12
0	i bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old i ended up returning it 3 days later i am a petite woman \( 5'2 \) and this item was totally uncomfortable ! i still have bruises under my arms from this item i followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual it bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits i would not reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as i am not worth the mone	12
0	the good thing is that except for the spring the jumper is pretty nice unfortunately the spring is the most important part and it is not good it has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it we gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl	12
0	this seemed like the original johnny jump up i had for my first child 13 years ago we loved that one so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it did n't work very well it just did n't seem as springy as it should be i ended up returning it and getting the 40 version with the tray instead \( the jump go \) people have complained about the tray pinching baby 's fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier also our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot	12
0	overpriced ! not what i expected ! you ca n't really used it because it 's too small for big bellied pregnant women ! uncomfortable ! the velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy yuck	12
0	we bought 2 of these and neither one keeps the wipes moist or warm save your mone	12
0	i unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift did not use one with our first child i got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before i decided to return it you literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir which slides on has no rubber seal or other watertight implements can leak everywhere judging by the other comments i'm glad it leaked before i had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes	12
0	i should have checked this out before registering for it the lid wo n't stay shut the bottom wipes brown the unit leaks i contacted the manufacturer when telling him about the lid not staying shut he asked are you sure there is n't a ghost in the house they offered to replace it if i returned it to them offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products after reading these reviews i think i 'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product	12
0	this wipe warmer is more trouble than it 's worth the water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table as a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes i emailed the manufacturer regarding this product to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective they failed to respond	12
0	this wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move we use cloth wipes it has burned a few smells moldy no matter what i have done to clean it \( never happened with any of our other wipes warmers \) wo n't stay closed it actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted burned the little foamish piece in it then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table get a different warmer this one is awful	12
0	we actually went through two of these in two weeks the first one cooked the bottom 20 wipes so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective the second one did the exact same thing ! we wasted so many wipes with this warmer since they were cooked we have even emailed the company and sent them pictures but never heard back from them save your money	12
0	i have 2 wipes warmers one for upstairs and one for downstairs at one point i had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work mine took forever to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section same as previous reviews the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly i have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine do not waste your money on the munchkin warmer	12
0	this wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid wo n't stay closed i waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table the wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid do n't buy this wipe warmer there are better ones out there	12
0	i picked this up at my babies r us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror i would be able to keep an eye on her from the minute i brought it home it smelled awful like artificial grapes i have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks at this point i am just going to throw it out because i ca n't imagine having that smell in my car ! \( i have since been back to babies r us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad and they do \) do n't buy it without smelling it	12
0	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat	12
0	i just took a course from the florida highway safety program i thought something like this would be wonderful especially for little ones in the rear facing position i was dead wrong anything put in front of on the side of in fact anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash this toy even latched down poses a threat to the baby he or she may just have to be bored for a while on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment	12
0	this is very cute but my baby is chubby it gave him a cut and bruises on both legs the seat is n't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off i wish it was bigger cause this is really cute so if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts	12
0	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage i'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend \( great proper latch ! \) and treatment for a mild yeast infection hope this helps	12
0	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out sort of but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips then when it comes time to change the film the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors my sister in law told me to register for it why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund	12
0	this would be a great space saver but now that gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars we never used it at all ! ! now gerber makes their own feeding center to accommodate their tubs and i love it	12
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in but really it took up too much counter space i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary i found save your money	12
0	i bought this potty seat for my daughter and i took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets the second i put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet ! the seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets that is a lie my toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through a waste of money and a safety hazard	12
0	i bought this product for childproofing purposes i was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer 's instructions state not to install gate against drywall \( which was not in the item description \) so i cannot use it where i needed it also the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close especially with a small child in your arms	12
0	this is a great gate if you have a strong healthy back and always have two hands available but how many people with kids have both of those ! it was great at keeping my baby in the room but my 4 year old could n't open it and neither could her grandma and it made me and my husband want to cuss it is back in the box and in the return pile do n't waste your money	12
0	the quality of this swaddle blanket is very good i'm not complaining about that the problem we 've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks this triggers his newborn rooting instinct which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger i recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item we own two of them and they keep our baby very cozy and warm	12
0	i bought this sling when i was still pregnant after my son was born i tried putting him in it but he just did n't seem secure so i threw it in the back of the closet when he turned one i dug it out again thinking it would work well as a hip carrier but it is even worse for this ! i had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful first of all the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone it is very painful with a heavier baby i took him out of it and will never touch the thing again	12
0	not much more for us at least we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange burgandy colors ! but when it come down to it we just could n't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby we used and liked a hand me down baby bjorn and breast friend sling much better sigh such a waste of a pretty sling	12
0	my son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long he wasnt the tiniest baby i tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing it 's the worst product ever i am definitely not using it and will probably donate it to goodwill	12
0	we bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she 's teething one day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip ! we let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she 's older	12
0	heed the bad reviews i think the problem may be medela 's definition of occasional use i used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half and apparently that is deemed more than occasional because the pump yields very little now about half of what it used to so this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion i should have gotten a different pump	12
0	i was very disappointed with this pump it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks and i only used it once a day even more disappointing was the companys return policy you have to ship it to them at your expense wait for them to send you a new one and return that one to the store do not waste your time	12
0	rent a hospital grade medalia pump you wont be sorr	12
0	this was the second pump i purchased i was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand i bought this pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the ac plug in is much weaker than the other side the motor died out after 2 weeks of use this pump is not meant for everyday use i just bought a medala and i hope to have a better expeirence with it	12
0	that would be one of my problems with this pump it hurt it took forever i did not have a good expereince with this pump	12
0	i wish i would have read the reviews on this before i bought the pump this is a bad breast pump i could n't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples it has very poor suction is a pain to put together and is uncomfortable to use so do n't waste your time and money buy something different if i could have rated this a negative i would have	12
0	this is the worst pump you could buy i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work please do n't waste your money i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product	12
0	i swear this is the crime ! the worst product in the western hemisphere never never buy this piece of garbage	12
0	i could not get this mirror to angle properly in our honda cr v to give a view of the baby and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test the image of the baby was so small that i could discern no details about what the baby was doing the mirror is also distorting the image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look directly into the center of the mirror	12
0	i thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that i have clean nipples for my baby unfortunately when you read the instructions for most latex nipples they are n't dishwasher safe and you are instructed to hand wash so having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless i use mine as a container that i can airdry my handwashed nipples in do n't waste your money	12
0	the maternity support did n't stay in place it kept bunching up in one spot and did n't help my back at all ! i would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product	12
0	very disappointed i bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after i pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant it has not helped me and has been annoying the l xl is too large but the s m was too small the material folds and rolls under my clothes and there 's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go i get sweaty underneath it and it 's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom which i'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks ! this was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop i went to i wish i 'd had the chance to try on others to compare	12
0	if i could have given this no stars i would have this product in l xl only fits a pre pregnancy 28 34 waist and in sizes that only goes up to a 18 so now i'm on the search for something a little bit bigger so if your pre pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side dont waste your money or time by getting this	12
0	i am so disgusted that i woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a dora toddler bed i held the dora toddler bed until christmas when on christmas eve i went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and i was unable to assemble the bed at all i ended up returning the bed in exchange fr nothing i found out that they no longer carry the bed	12
0	wow cheap plastic poorly routed holes took 1 2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction sent it back my daughter loved the dora picture and was very sad that she could n't keep it	12
0	i purchased this bed online last year it looks great and as we all know our daughters love dora however the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy you would problably give up the rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months 60 br 62 what a waste of money invest a bed that your child can growth with and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child	12
0	nine days from mn to pa seems too long perhaps target direct got process problems i am not satisified got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	12
0	i thought that these would be great but could never get them to work right sometimes they would flow sometimes not i would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over to many pieces to much trouble i would be upset and my baby would be also ! switched to avent and loving it	12
0	these bottles leak after a few months and it 's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle you almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak	12
0	i purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes it impossible to close with one hand even if you do n't care about the one hand feature it is still a hassle to adjust i do not suggest buying this gate	12
0	unfortunately despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway i have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards it was not sturdy at all returned it	12
0	this gate is almost totally useless unless your doorways and walls are all perfectly plumb and square and happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock that is	12
0	i thought this would be great for the size the changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic it provides no padding at all the case itself is padded why did n't they use the padding on the changing pad instead of the case \? very uncomfortable for baby \( it is basically like laying out a piece of paper \) i 'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags	12
0	the bumper was very cute and colorful and i was excited to put it on the baby 's crib until i put it on no matter how i tried to fit it onto the crib \( it is a white spindle jenny lind crib full size \) it fit very akwardly and never quite right there were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib i was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts	12
0	i really thought these were the cutest bumper pads but after hearing over and over again how you should n't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication i decided it would n't be worth the risk to put them on the crib i do n't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one and even if there were i would n't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them she has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these again cute for the nursery set up pre baby but i would n't use afterwards	12
0	this is a great product for a few weeks then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out ! i go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out no matter how tight i make the blanket the velcro comes apart i encourage you to buy their other swaddleme blanket with the larger velcro flap	12
0	this product was a waste of my money it was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use my husband tore it off the day after we got it i would rather use duck tape then this product \)	12
0	i was really unhappy with this lock it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	12
0	i received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow although the tag reads 100 cotton it is most certainly not the soft 100 jersey cotton advertised the print is cute but i was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling i gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising but if one is looking for a nice regular cotton crib sheet this would probably be okay	12
0	just as the other mothers have stated nothing about this pump is beneficial it was given to me by a lactation nurse but it was more trouble than it was worth only once was i able to pump more than one ounce \( it took almost an hour \) and i hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing i only needed it occassionally but this was such a waste of time i bought the pump in style which is amazing this is not comparable to the more expensive medela pumps so if you want something that works with little discomfort invenst in the pump in style or similar model do n't waste your money even if it is cheap	12
0	lucky for me i didn't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps what a waste of time you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked	12
0	this pump was refered to me by the hospital where i had my first son so since i got it and used it my breast hurt worse using this pump then when i was engorged it was one of the worst experiances i was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby i connot recommend enough to not use this one i am know expecting again and looking for a pump i know that i will not go by hospital recommendation again	12
0	i bought this pump because it had the medela name and i thought it was reliable i was wrong this is the worst pump in the world everything the other poster said is true this is the worst breastpump i would not recommend this breastpump to anyone	12
0	we purchased storkcraft 's rochester stages crib in natural aspen changing table 5 drawer dresser 3 drawer dresser 2 side units \( left and right \) and a hutch every single piece of furniture that we 've gotten from storkcraft is damaged in some way nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces on the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked it 's obvious that storkcraft has no quality control we 're in the process of deciding whether or not we 're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and or a new unit all i'm going to say is do n't waste your time on purchasing storkcraft furniture	12
0	i ordered this crib almost a month ago and i could n't be more disappointed every single piece was damaged somehow either chipped cracked discolored or stained i will never buy a storkcraft piece ever again do n't waste your time and money on this crib ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
0	i looked amazing on the computer but let me tell you it was ugly ! we had recived it my mail and it was cheap plastic fake wood ! ! ! needless to say it went back ! ! ! i also was upset by the way it was delivered it was left on my front patio blocking my door in the pouring rain so i am sure the crib was wet as well	12
0	we were so excited to try a jumper for our son but were very dissapointed in this product first of all he tipped himself right out of it ! with the three strap design it 's unsturdy in the back which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor he seemed pretty intent on jumping so now we 've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he 's nice and snug but it 's still unstable and wobbly i do n't recommend this product and in fact we are going to try a different brand	12
0	i was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first i went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out the sternum strap would not even snap over my chest i have an average build but have a chest and it would'nt reach my friend tried it also and had the same problem i would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake	12
0	my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i 'll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes	12
0	reasons why i do not like this potty 1 \) the shield falls off with one touch ussually into the potty ! 2 \) the potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways 3 \) it is cumbersome to empty the potty 4 \) once the shield is lost \( since it impossible to keep attached \) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess i highly recommend that bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield	12
0	definately not a potty for boys as with other reviewers the shield does not stay on looking for another simple and basic potty now o	12
0	though this potty is nicely priced it 's worth it to buy a more expensive one though mine has n't fallen apart like other reviewers it does shift around on the base allowing for spillage the removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat so my daughter gets stuff all over the inside not just in the receptacle the inside has a criss crossed honeycomb type pattern \( see my customer image \) so it 's impossible to clean messes out of it it does serve it 's purpose as a potty but i'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one	12
0	i got this potty for my baby shower i registered for it because it was safety first and most of their products are excellent i set it out to introduce it to my son \( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet \) we never actually used it since the top of the seat and i mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart instead we bought a plain potty seat by graco and it is excellent !	12
0	i hate hate hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy	12
0	i purchased this baby carrier for my 1 month old son when i put him in it he looked so uncomfortable i tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit but it still covered his face so i decided to shell out the for the infant support pillow expecting that to make a difference it did n't he still looked uncomfortable and squished only now i wasted more money my son is 21 1 2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz i ca n't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all a big disappointment if you 're looking for a carrier try the bjorn a million times better than this	12
0	i 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week old son i just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable he usually cries when he is in it he fell asleep in it once but he looked so contorted it 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way and the pocket is so deep it closes over his head and i know i got the correct size i 've given up and am looking for a better sling right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day and he loves it but it 's a little cumbersome and i want him to be able to recline	12
0	rather than this sling i recommend you check out for your sling they are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors this is a far better buy than the native baby carrier	12
0	when my daughter was tiny she enjoyed being in this sling on the one or two occasions i managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes the cotton fabric does n't offer much support for the baby 's weight and i found it became uncomfortable very quickly it also did n't feel as secure as some of the padded over the shoulder style slings i actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times which defeats the purpose	12
0	this sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap there are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle	12
0	i'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo old son weighs 28 lbs and should be able to stay in it for alot longer \( up to 40 lbs \) the straps are let all the way out and it 's still too tight for him i would n't recommend this car seat for chunky babies	12
0	and had problems with it from the beginning the cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached evenflo did replace it after i sent pictures the shade protector does n't stay up i had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter i wish i had checked safety ratings and reviews before i purchased this product	12
0	i loved the idea that this car seat was then after i bought it i have had problems with it the handle realse has broken many times then the gray handle part has came apart also this is has not been safe at all i went to return it and target would not return or exchange it for me i think it was a waste of money	12
0	the product is flimsy the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine and the seat is too large for a toddler my child does not feel comfortable using this potty	12
0	the idea is good but it does not sit well on oblong toilets the adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus would recommend with round toilet only	12
0	the freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea but the plastic is very flimsy and when set in place it just barely reaches the floor it 's a pretty unstable situation a separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better	12
0	it 's not just the most icredible piece of junk i ever seen it is the most dangerous piece of junk i ever seen on the market for kids the plastic is very thin very weak and bends every each way my daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight is slides off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child 's weight which really frightened my girl there 's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat i feel soooo stupid to have bought it \( \(	12
0	i bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant i wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat watch tv or drink his sippy cup this chair was the perfect height design and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky the problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip the fault is in a joint i bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when i packed but then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two that joint is really weak too bad ! it 's such an adorable product	12
0	these bowls are not worth the money they do not stay on the table at all !	12
0	i tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed the suction wo n't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table on the kitchen counter top \( formica \) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal i am returning mine to the store today dissapointing but they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature	12
0	the suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat they do come in lovely colors though	12
0	i agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately i always follow the measuring instructions but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot even though i have been practicing to get it right i wish it were more accurate and for someone like me who only has a 3 room apartment the cooling feature is not that useful	12
0	not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected my child 's grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it and nobody in this household is overweight	12
0	after reading all the rave reviews we put pupsqueak on our baby 's registry but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he did n't work we tried exchanging him for another one at babies r us but we could n't find one that worked so instead we exchanged him for the dinosaur \( i forget his name \) our daughter loves him since he 's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her she loves falling asleep holding onto mr dyno	12
0	i bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first my daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor it fits beautifully on my graco quattro tour stroller the big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off revealing a screw which scratched my daughters arm i feel sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off	12
0	after only 2 months this toy fell apart my daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail 's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams 20 is not cheap for this toy and i think the quality should have been alot better	12
0	these come in both boy and girl colors the picture shows pink purple and yellow bottles i received blue and green bottles i contacted amazon who promptly sent me another three sets \( all of the first three sets were wrong \) in the second shipment they only got one set right i e mailed to return these as well when i sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because they had already replaced the items be careful when ordering from this site	12
0	my son is ten days old i tried these bottles and was highly disappointed the liners are a pain in the butt once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again i changed to dr brown 's bottles and my son is having less gas and is n't wearing his food	12
0	seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants so now it sits in my car fading in the sun save your money	12
0	this is o k if you 're using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	12
0	i'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump now i'm looking for another one it 's difficult to pump if you have large nipples you have to buy extra sheild which costs extra it 's noisy it loses suction the milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy i clean the parts everyday i have contacted medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor \( great customer service \) it worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening i guess it works for some and not others now i'm in the hunt for another pump since i want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year	12
0	i bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they would n't leak like the last ones i had used they do n't leak but the stage 1 is too slow and frustrates her she 's 5 months and the stage 2 is too fast they made a huge mistake in not making more stages had i realized this before i had used them i would have taken them all back	12
0	i thought this cover was horrible it does n't cover enough area of the cart it 's difficult to put on because of all the ties i could n't even get the harness to fit right try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic you can put them on the cart with one hand and it completely covers the cart even the big ones at costco	12
0	you do n't want this one although the fabric is appealing \( calm stripes vs the buzy themes of the other covers \) this cover will not fit most shopping carts it only fits the carts found at small city super markets if you are a suburbian shopper you 'll have to spend the bucks for a more satisfactory product	12
0	i tried putting this on a shopping cart from target this does not cover area at all ! ! i caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped ! not good plus its annoying to put on	12
0	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same other covers i 've seen just slip on this one has to be tied on also it does n't cover the entire cart there is an opening that my baby 's fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle not a great product spend the extra money and buy the better one	12
0	this product serves its purpose but does not need to cost almost 30 ! basically it 's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it i'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well if not better if you take the time to look	12
0	i received this after much debate about the prior review had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer so i bought it and sure enough had the same problem amazon was great they sent me a replacement and still the same problem my baby is due any day so i am keeping the first one but sending back the replacement it doesnt come as described no blanket included and i dont see how you could adjust the wedge i am very disappointed with the product but happy about amazon 's willingness to assist in the issue	12
0	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable but i do n't quite get how to adjust this it also says that there is a blanket maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1 2 inches thick i'm pretty disappointed i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems	12
0	i am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors the battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so i ca n't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery and it does n't just beep once it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it i have to keep it on the charger all night so it does n't go out there is tons of static and extra noise also the belt clip is not tight the monitor always falls off of my belt if i bend down to much just super dissapointed with these monitors absolutely not worth its big price tag ! ! please look elsewhere do not recommend !	12
0	we have the graco ultra clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years with a new baby on the way we thought we 'd upgrade to the new technology oops it turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the ultra clear \( could n't even make it to the other side of the house \) and the reception was quite poor and the annoying beeping was the clincher i sent it back today and bought another 40 ultra clear oh and i tried the fisher price private connection also and had the same issues	12
0	i purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago and i have used it all of two times it creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted and i really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized i am terribly disappointed with this product and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind	12
0	it does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water it is worse if you use tap water it does n't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed when you lift the cap all the water drip you will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use the plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat you wonder if it is going to melt i am a fan of gerber products but this one does not work	12
0	both my children get thrush very easy so i purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use my kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards if my kids keep getting thrush obviously this product does not work	12
0	we just learned in parenting class \( and i checked with my pediatrician \) that you do n't need to sterlize bottles nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher so save some money and do n't get this !	12
0	this product is a mess i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50 down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun	12
0	i received this steralizer as a gift if i had to do all over again i would have never put it on my registry the steralizer is messy everytime i lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere in addition i have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out there has to be a better way	12
0	i was given this as a gift so thankfully i did n't waste my money on it this sterilizer is so messy and awkward that i can not recommend it at all the metal pan started corroding after only a week little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop all the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty so i ca n't imagine how it could possibly clean horrible product	12
0	this is the worst nursing pad that i 've tried it slips out of place and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it i found myself with wet bras all the time ! these pads are terrible ! i recommend the lansinoh brand	12
0	these breast pads are sooooo different from the johnson johnson product they do n't absorb your milk which means it still gets all over your clothes the do n't have adhesive which means the pads move all over the place generally just a waste of money you might as well use toilet tissue \)	12
0	i received a box as a shower gift and they worked okay unless i changed them a lot though they ended up leaking i was resigned to just living with wet spots until someone gave me some of the lansinoh pads to try i have no idea why babies r us does n't arry them but they really need to these things absolutely do not leak they hold tons of liquid	12
0	after three weeks my brush broke too ! cannot find a replacement i do not want to buy a whole new rack design fault that they should correct not good enoug	12
0	after spending over 30 for this item we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across a seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong would not purchase again or recommend to others	12
0	we own two of these and they have never been easy to use we tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat we have kept it though we bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off we would not buy this one again we do have large carseats they are both britax marathons	12
0	waste of money does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this	12
0	do not buy this mattress it is not safe this mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins when i called kolcraft to inform them the cs rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit and that they have n't had any complaints she also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size we have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug the kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily	12
0	i just bought this seat for my 9 month old son i bought it for the convenience of the fold down front as good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees he is a thin baby so i do n't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby also the seat it self is slippery i have to place a rag down before i put the baby in because he will slide forward if i do n't this is very uncomfortable for him unfortunately this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier that is really the only good thing i can say about this product	12
0	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing and now it is starting to fall apart they just do n't seem to be well made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure	12
0	i really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in however the quality of the material is less than desirable the cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier i expected some shrinkage but it seems excessive i still use the covers but am disappointed overall the material is not very soft so admittedly i will look around for other products	12
0	i have to say that i just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail \( i ordered online because i'm so far from a babies r us location \) and i was excited at first the color is great and the cover fit perfectly but i have n't washed it yet actually i have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric the fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area \( middle of long side \) i plan to exchange this cover for another of the same i hope for better luck with the next one but man the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating	12
0	i had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white	12
0	i bought this but it 's junk my husband and i have both tried it on ourselves and ca n't get it to register of 95 degrees that 's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one	12
0	this carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached the fabric is very cheap and it melted in the dryer i wash my carseats after every roadtrip and it did n't even last one roadtrip before melting it ripped the day that i got it trying to adjust the straps i was very disappointed in this carseat i would not purchase it again i loved my previous carseats being the alpha omega and a graco if you are looking for something cheap this is the product there are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured try those ones first this is an awful carseat	12
0	i bought the avent breastshells because of my sore nipples and a way to collect leaking milk while i was not nursing and relieve some engorment 1 it is very messy when removing the colleting cap2 my nipples are still sore3 and the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pumpif i would have known about these factors i would not have purchased this product	12
0	it made my breasts look funny it made my nipples more irritable it left painful marks on my breasts hardly ever used it	12
0	i tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me they were hot and of course they also showed right through any top i was wearing i had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention	12
0	not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position the wheels have a mind of their own the handles make it hard to go up curbs hard to close up need both hands and foot but can fit a graco infant car seat compact fold and light	12
0	the volume control on this is totally lame i ca n't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime also the sound quality is poor in general i suppose it 's ok for just playing in the room but definitely not for bed you can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price	12
0	i bought this item on my own because i read the wonderful reviews it received i really do n't know how this item can be used even if you do n't use the air vented cups \( which collect the leaking milk \) you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing i was wearing a sweater you could see the shape of the shells right through it if you do use the cups they supply you look absolutely abnormal i guess this does n't work for large breasted women	12
0	we have n't yet put the bed together so it might be great but i gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it did n't ! this was a common complaint in reviews two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped it did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well there is a phone number to call if parts are damaged we 'll do that soon i 'll update this review if everything is fixed	12
0	we received this item as a xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken my two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor the legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item we were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a step 2 product	12
0	i recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide within one week of use the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable i am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type this gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for	12
0	i recently purchased this gate as i needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide i was so happy when i found this and for the price ! well i installed it with no problem at all but it is not secure it actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break awful and very unsafe ! ! ! target com was very helpful in sending ups to pick it up	12
0	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child my children are 19 mo apart i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it this one is definitely not the same for one thing it is very hard to steer and get over bumps the wheels are always getting stuck second it is hard to close the most frustrating part is the steering issue also my aria decal fell off as well many months ago i 've only had the stroller for nine months one more thing the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun	12
0	if you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you but just try turning and especially sharp turns you 'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way	12
0	my hsuband and and decided that i would nurse hailey her entire first year i work at a school and was able to pump twice a day i did n't like doing it in school though because there was n't space for it so i would go in my car and do it all i had a first was the battery pack i would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week i would loose strength suction once i got the adapter i never had a problem again we could go anywhere and i would always have access to power including when we drove from va to ga my husband would drive and i would pump it is great	12
0	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive well i learned my lessen you get what you pay for like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw if you will closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie i hope this will work out much better	12
0	i did n't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out and it does take standard garbage bags after a few months of use the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off i assembled it back together and within a few days the spring broke in half i tried to get another spring by calling safety first they only had the blue top without the spring the guy said i 'd just have to buy another pail if i wanted a working pop top	12
0	i wish i would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these are flimsy thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter i'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad fortunately there are other products that work better if this was the only option i might as well not have a sheet on at all	12
0	i bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the nurser which i already had but needed more bottles for convenience i was very disappointed the lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap i used it for about a week and then got rid of it	12
0	it 's flimsy breaks at the slightest touch it 's a pain to open and close ! my 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens i found this out when i was putting groceries away i went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top ! i ca n't say enough bad things about this gate it 's worthless if i could rate it minus stars i would	12
0	this gate is absolutely worthless if i could give it zero stars i would it was difficult to install and is very flimsy i have it at the top of the stairs and i do n't trust that it will hold at all i hate that i spent so much on the gate and now i have to purchase another one	12
0	this is the flimsiest gate ever to boot it is not cheap i could n't even use the screws that came with the gate i had to use nails and duck tape the instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together unfortunately when i bought this gate there were only 2 reviews posted one was good and one was not so good so i was a little confused but i needed a swing gate so needless to say i wanted to make sure that i put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled this gate is n't even worth 1 0	12
0	hard to install ridiculously confounding installation directions and when you 're done it 's flimsy do n't waste your money	12
0	this gate is horrible to try to open and close do n't try to pinch pennies when it 's your little one 's safety and your convenience at stake buy the configure gate instead you 'll be glad you did it is well worth every penny this one is n't worth a thing	12
0	the design is pretty narrow my 3 4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described the product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry unless you have a very small and quiet baby otherwise it is not a wise choice	12
0	as the other reviewer stated the seal appears to be faulty on this and it stopped working almost straight away i have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well	12
0	i bought this thermometer and liked it but after i used it a few times the buttons stopped working and i could n't turn it off i opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it a bath thermometer should at least be waterproof	12
0	i love the idea of this product like many of the other reviewer 's i do n't have the regular traditional style crib our crib converts to a toddler bed this product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs i would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one 's that are more with the current styles of cribs like mine 's	12
0	this is a great idea however if your crib has anything larger than a jenny lind style piece of wood on it it wo n't work we do n't have a sleigh style crib but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch it would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular larger style cribs everyone seems to be making buying these days	12
0	i bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck this item was made for a portable small crib not your typical crib i had to go out and spend another 40 on velcro so i can make it long wide enough to fit my son 's crib it is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib do n't waste your money on something that is not going to work	12
0	product is not worth the money made the bassinet very unstable	12
0	do not like this productit is very hard to get rail under bedpops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac	12
0	i found the product highly unsafe as a stroller the handle is very flimsy and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller also the wheels do not lock properly and safely its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	12
0	this product was terrible first and foremost this seat did not fit on american airlines business class seats ! secondly the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt the wheel covers fell off the first time i used it the stroller is a piece of junk when i called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match do not buy	12
0	i thought that this bathtub would be the best thing because of the shower and spa feature but the shower is so hard to use it 's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time you also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling beacause it 's just not positiioned right it sits too high up and she just looks uncomfortable on it you also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit it was n't worth 40 the sling and the spa and shower unit is n't useful or helpfula t all	12
0	we do n't have our baby yet but have tried the tub to see if it works the first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it this second one the spa works but the shower does n't the company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor will try it again with the new motor of if the third one does n't work we will return it and get a different tub and probably something else for that money	12
0	i would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all ! this seemed like a good idea but my little guy was kicking and moving all over it barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath it also says that it is for 0 months on up but i definitely would n't use this if your baby ca n't sit	12
0	my 2 1 2 year was interested in this seat right away much more so than his small potty however he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard he gets wet the floor and his step stool are all wet clean up is a nightmare it 's in the trash now	12
0	we had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son boy were we wrong the first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart so we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again he only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50 i would definitely not recommend this to anyone	12
0	this idea is nice but the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap next the tray is hard to get off and wash next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray and that is really hard to get off by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash unless you are super woman i would not bu	12
0	it lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it now the bad ! the pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it first he takes the tray off \( also very easy for him \) and then he pulls the back off at that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing do n't plan on it lasting through more than one child	12
0	i purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so i have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units the sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that i would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them	12
0	we bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents however he is a very large boy \( 35 and 34 lbs \) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably so we took off the tray so he could sit at the table and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food we went back to the high chair without the tray and he is perfectly happy we use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food	12
0	we bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby by her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom she was hurt pretty bad no way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight please beware of how unsafe this product is not at all what is advertised	12
0	i received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is i have a large baby he was almost 17 lbs at four months old so his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age he also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs he did n't seem very happy in it it may work better if you have a smaller baby but the chubbier ones will never fit for long	12
0	the monitor is ok but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new channel and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby 's room not on the parent unit ! ! ! also we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static broken signal \( only to be reset by changing the channel \) and no signal overall i am very disappointed it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly and i am goig back to my old one	12
0	i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it i find it a nightmare ! if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out it does not work when on the charger it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts what a piece of junk i would in no way recommend this product to anyone	12
0	i will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference but ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall charging for days at a time and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck i had ignored a review i read similar to the one i'm writing just before i purchased this imonitor i learned my lesson ! purchase with caution	12
0	i bought this for my daughter and i too had one light that worked my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work i am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus my daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on needless to say i am very disappointed with this toy	12
0	my baby got this for christmas he was about 7 months old now a couple months later he still does n't play with it my 3 year old does n't play with it either and he loves most of our other baby toys this toy is just not that interesting i wish my mother in law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all	12
0	i gave my father in law a couple ideas for my son 's \( 1 year old \) christmas gift and this was one of the items boy do i regret giving him this as an idea it is a cheaply constructed toy the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market skip this one	12
0	i bought this toy for my 6 month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play when putting it together christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off also one light does not work the poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from fischer price i will be returning \( not exchanging \) this toy luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it	12
0	it 's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached effectively serves its purpose but for nearly 16 bucks \? ! ! puleeeeeeeease	12
0	my daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times ! i am returning it first thing in the morning i should have never let her on it a second time if she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over please do not buy this product	12
0	this was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about 5 00 at any hardware store it cost me a total of 23 00 after shipping for this product it does n't even look like the picture it is n't black with angelcare written on it it is literally a normal brown piece of board it 's blatant false advertizing i feel sick not to mention a total idiot for thinking i would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor if you have the angelcare movement sensor monitor and do n't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard do not buy this it is a disgrace	12
0	i was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by i tried it out with a baby doll first and i ended up covering the snuggle nest with my blankets in the middle of the night	12
0	this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid it 's easy enough to install but hello ! what 's to stop anybody especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together \? not a thing ! the kit that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it 's closed it does n't fit snuggly around the seat so it 's completely loose total and complete piece of junk ! !	12
0	we bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close and hard to open specially the one that goes between the legs it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that i'm afraid i'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them and is complicated to align them to finally buckle in fact i had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips	12
0	when my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head side wings this pillow worked well it was propped well enough to support my son 's head when he took a nap but when we had to switch him to a straight back booster seat that had shallow head wings this pillow was not usable at all	12
0	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow i returned it	12
0	i could n't wait to get it i got so excited when it finally arrived ! so i used it right away ! sooo disapointed ! it did not get anything out at all it is soooo weak ! the one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from target and it works ! but this nasal clear is no good do not buy it	12
0	i was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere i looked so i figured it must be awesome not so it is loud which freaked out my 8 month old and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well i 've tried every aspirator on the market and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital i took that one home with me and urge you to do the same \) very disappointed	12
0	this product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins we had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless unless your child 's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators	12
0	now that i have this chair i'm not going to replace it but i have two major complaints about it our son is 20 months old and i still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table raising the height does n't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you ca n't scoot the chair in any closer to a table the chair also has a very large footprint unless you have a very spacious dining area it 's hard maneuvering around it if i could do it over again i would n't buy this high chair	12
0	i'm on child number 2 with this chair and my complaints are the same 1 they tray is way too high for an infant young toddler to reach anything my son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray 2 it is a cleaning nightmare i am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair ! good points pop off tray divider that keeps them from slipping out cool colorsi tried a friend 's cheap evenflo chair and i loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less	12
0	i agree with several others about it being very difficult to clean there are so many nooks and crannies i used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when i had my son and it was no different my son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that i do not want to let him practice because i dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal i went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great ! now i have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair	12
0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week the prima pappa is comfortable and secure in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles	12
0	first the adhesive velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least second it is opaque so the kids could n't even take in their surroundings since it resembles a parachute the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the stupid thing would n't stay attached to the stroller the kids probably would n't have had fresh air go for hats and sunscreen protective garments instead	12
0	i bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we 're out running not only do the tabs not stick as any toddler would she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world would n't you \?	12
0	we love this monitor but only when it does not have awful interference unfortunately in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours we do not live in an apartment or townhouse \( which i read was not recommended for this product \) but we do have wireless internet only we are n't using it when there is static so who knows i love being able to see my boy but the static makes the monitor really annoying	12
0	the walker has a few flaws first of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal it is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child 's head my son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker constantly the seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high it should be roomier and drop lower	12
0	this is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason the front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels do n't just like a car it can only go forward and backward but not sideways sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she ca n't push the walker that way because of the design and she gets frustrated if both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction it would have had much greater mobility	12
0	i tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable you didnt even have one walker availiable how is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker \? i was very disapionted i guess that i would have to rate you with a zero and i would like to know when will there be any walkers available \? i like to shop with amazon	12
0	we could n't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker unfortunately after countless times of putting in new batteries we realized that the toy did n't work i immediately contacted kolcraft and they are sending me another toy i also wished i had gotten the one with the mirror instead i have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it and to add to that she only stays in it for about 15 20 minutes other than that i really like the walker ! lol i think it will be better once we get a new toy	12
0	i was given this as a gift and i was very excited to use it out and about but when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off plus when we were all done i had to try to clean it off as best i could then put it in my diaper bag yuck ! i much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table	12
0	to see how worthless the graco lovin' hug swing is the baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds \( the swing has a supposed 30 pound limit \) the swing is on hard floors is brand new as are the batteries and still the swing barely moves at all even on the highest level ! when i contacted the company they told me that the swing wo n't go as high when a baby gets larger but this brief movie proves that it wo n't go at all ! ! instead i highly recommend the fisher price ocean wonders aquarium swing i only wish it held a larger baby so i could continue to use it !	12
0	besides the fact that the straps where n't long enough to hold on to my son crib it ended up on the floor every other day ! ! ! save your money and do n't buy it ! ! !	12
0	the quot sticky quot pads that are supposed to hold the organizer do n't even stick so every morning i would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table and this was with absolutely no items in it the organizer does n't come with any information so i had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not this is a great idea but it is very poorly constructed	12
0	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small do n't waste your money it 's not worth it !	12
0	i got two of these as shower gifts i thought that they would be so handy wrong ! the velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table the openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are very small they will only hold the travel size or the next size up it was made cheep the quot shelves quot are not sturdy at all save your money !	12
0	we loved the monitor at first the features are nice and the price was reasonable then without event or explanation it died one day and we have n't been able to recharge one of the handheld units maybe we got a dud	12
0	we purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units do n't bother whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor 's baby ! what 's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you ca n't then walk into the baby 's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren \? \? \? \? they are getting returned right away	12
0	you really do get what you pay for i got this for around 53 but i did not like this product at all ! the bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made the comforter is pretty cheap too the only thing i saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup	12
0	tired of hearing your baby cry \? this is the monitor for you you 'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing looks like evenflo was being literal when they named the product whisper connect you can barely hear anything at full volume i'm going to return it tomorrow if i can resist backing over it with our car	12
0	the monitor was terrible ! it would only pick up our baby 's voice when she was screaming it had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference it is going back to the store and i am looking for something else i wish i would have checked ratings first ! choose something else	12
0	we have the 49mhz whisper connect and love it \( see our review of that one \) we needed a second monitor to replace a 900mhz fisher price monitor that is 4 years old and decided to try this one out we set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up we thought we must have a defective unit so we returned it and got another and we had the same problem there is no interference or static with the monitor but also no sound we 're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	12
0	this monitor did n't work for us at all ! we heard a lot of static and the alarm would go off too it would n't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen the alarm was always going off	12
0	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range well i have problems similar to sara 's when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear that 's why i gave it a 2nd star this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	12
0	i 've heard avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself i just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and both link not just a littler either but with every use my daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases i find this odd b c the 6mths cups do n't link at all i think these products are very hit or miss you may get a leaky cup or you they may work great \?	12
0	this is an okay product with many many parts to clean the spout the ring for the top of the cup the handles and the plastic leak stopper oh and the cup ! all the parts fly around the dishwahser i 've lost many stoppers so i 've had to order through avent the good thing is they do n't leak	12
0	i am so disappointed by another avent product that is just no good short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak my son 's cups have leaked on him on the floor in his diaper bag and in the car i do n't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star mom 's have enough too do running around cleaning after leaky unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the avent magic cup	12
0	i too thought that since we had such great luck with avent bottles that we would love their magic cups i am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups it seems like the lid and cup do n't seal together well enough to withstand any activity i'm sad to have to give avent a bad rating but do n't waste your money on these cups	12
0	avent makes the best washable baby bottles around so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good well we were wrong of the five cups we had all of them leaked and have since been thrown out the cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces which makes them harder to wash harder to put together and more pieces to lose as far as sippy cups go these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands we have had great luck with greber 's and playtex 's please avoid	12
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately was about to use my own then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall	12
0	i would have rated this item 0 stars if that were an option we discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation fortunately we discovered this because we were moving not because a piece of furniture fell i shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped	12
0	we got this as a gift and have used it 0 times it 's expensive and poorly designed a large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper easier to fold and nicer looking	12
0	this did not work for us at all i found that i could n't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off if you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton	12
0	i agree with the first reviewer cindy i love the concept but the proportions on this swaddler just are n't right unless you have a really tiny baby or one that does n't kick his her legs much \( my one month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long \) the velcro does n't hold because the patches are too small and the knit fabric is too stretchy however i put him in the larger size swaddleme today and it fits much better	12
0	we have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us we were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us so now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor if you live out in the middle of no where or you do n't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you	12
0	i bought this bundle me in nov and it did not even last 2 5 months the zipper broke it is not well made stick with the other bundle mes the urban bundle me is cheaply made not worth the pric	12
0	very useless pants i bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and i did buy the correct size they even leaked when used over diapers at night they bascially do nothing	12
0	the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item and were unable to fix the problem	12
0	i received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter i thought it was a wonderful toy and so did my daughter after playing a while with it on the floor my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands and fell down and the toy dropped on the floor at this point the toy started to malfunction the music would play sometimes and not others and after being dropped to the floor a couple more times it stopped working altogether i think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be great toy but it did n't last long	12
0	this carrier did n't survive one airline trip the bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip this carrier is junk waste of my money	12
0	i used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made then i got a new bag \( customer service was very nice and helpful \) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it \( my stroller was n't damaged \) so i have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money still waiting on a refund	12
0	i like this humidifier alot but now i cannot find replacement filters for it i only had it for about 3 months and now i cannot find replacement filters this unit was not cheap either it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating i would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only	12
0	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud	12
0	i was so excited when i recieved this humidifier at my baby shower but after several tries i finally returned it this product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically well the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on my baby wakes up crying ! ! ! note that i live 2 miles from an airforce base and the planes do n't even wake her ! ! ! ! do n't buy this product	12
0	too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly i feel like i'm constantly filling the container w water though my son is a sound sleeper it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b c of the loudness of the humidificr i would not buy this item	12
0	i was looking forward to getting this toy for my son but when i opened it up i was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag i thought the picture showed several more tools maybe my tool kit was not complete either way my son never really showed much interest in it	12
0	i have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her i will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck	12
0	i bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle wrong ! ! ! she hated these bottles i would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder i gave these bottles one star because i think it is a good concept but unfortunately did n't work for us the only bottle she would take was the playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth	12
0	i spent a lot of time researching strollers and after reading all of the reviews for the aria i decided to register for one out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight but i have not been pleased with it since the shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat the snack cup has never stayed in place steering this stroller is impossible we took it to disney last month and i almost left it in florida all in all i expected a lot more from peg perego	12
0	i just bought the knobs and they are terrible ! ! ! ! i have so much trouble opening them do not buy it ! ! ! ! it's a waste of money it 's better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it	12
0	with our knobs being on the front of the stove these covers hung down over the oven door and either got in the way or were popped off on a regular basis \( or pulled off by our 16 month old \) we found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop was n't in use	12
0	my 15 month old son pulled these off \( and broke one \) within about 5 minutes of installing them also he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas bad design do n't waste your money	12
0	i bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface they fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around also a few of my knobs pull off easily my son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come both knob and cover then it 's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover they do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to i'm just not sure if it 's worth it it probably depends on your stove	12
0	this pump is really slow and absolutely kills your hand for about the same price get the avent isis manual pump it is waaaaaay faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump so it does n't hurt your hand i have n't found that it hurts my hand at all because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often	12
0	the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place i would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected	12
0	there is no need for this item it is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed i hated having a wall between my baby and me when i woke up to nurse i had to take her out of it anyway co sleeping is intuitive naturally safe and easy easy easy please do n't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement	12
0	the item is sloppy looking and feeling unlike the photo of the black ellaroo i did n't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip maybe i just never got it adjusted correctly but i read the instructions and gave it many tries however on a positive note i was refunded my money with no problem there was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front so i have no problem with the seller	12
0	this is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day let down happens very quickly and i can get 3 oz in 15 to 20 min my baby is a month old and i use this pump so i can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter geat pump at a great price	12
0	do n't buy peg perego their customer service is horrible ! ! i will never buy from them again ! !	12
0	it worked great for a few days then as i got to the bottom of the batch of wipes they were totally dry also the whole thing flooded my changing table not sure why but i am returning this unit	12
0	my husband and i purchased this set with my first son but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son the difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks sometimes more than that it is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling i hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings	12
0	i used these through out my daughter 's infancy largely because i bought a whole set of them the milk storage contraptions the breast pump and the pacifiers plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she would n't take any other kind but the bottles routinely leaked ruining several diaper bags clothing and nighttime feedings apparently you have to screw the cap on just right which is really difficult at 3 am ! my daughter did n't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months all in all i think the paci 's are great the rest of it i could do without	12
0	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas when they 're using the bottle you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips every time my little girl uses them it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them i would recommend dr brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these ultimately the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause	12
0	i bought the avent bottles when i was pregnant because they were babiesrus 's best pick yeah right ! i wonder how many are returned on a daily basis aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking ! i would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money	12
0	the idea for this product is great the problem is with its design and or choice of materials regarding the buckles the buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex this caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place they instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage if another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect	12
0	i bought this set for my daughter the bedding is such a poor quality that my daughter wo n't sleep in her bed she says the sheets are itchy the comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard i would not recomend this set to anyone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
0	do not buy this or any item from baby age their customer service is horrible amazon should remove all of their listings	12
0	i placed this order on july 25th amazon 's estimated delivery date is aug 18th 25th i contacted babyage and my order wont be sent until the 6th of sept very disappointed	12
0	this sounded like a great item however it has proven to be useless first it wo n't stop a child from opening the door second when the door is opened the guard falls out when the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut thus the child ca n't pinch their fingers however the catch which goes behind the door is too small enabling it to fall through	12
0	our 4 month old loved this toy at first but we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it did n't work more than it did runs through batteries much too quickly also unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin but now it is in the trash because i touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust not very safe very disappointed	12
0	i was really hopeful about this diaper bag when i ordered it through amazon the size is small and convenient but i found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck also the clasp broke after i had it for only 2 weeks ! i am really disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag	12
0	the third time i wore it as i tried to zip the bottom most compartment with one hand \( other arm is carrying my 14 month old \) the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable i do not recommend this product because of its poor construction	12
0	i bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs unless you have a changing station \( or crib wherever you want to hang it \) that has slits or slots able to hold it the velcro will not hold it well and the shelves are a bit insecure it 's a great idea but just did n't pan out	12
0	i purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my delta luv changing table because there was no storage space on top i had high hopes for it munchkin products are usually high in quality however the cloth on this organizer sags when i tried to fill it with my wipes box baby powder and lotion as shown in the picture the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out i would n't want a toddler getting near this organizer ! a much safer option is the plastic diaper depot by prince lionheart	12
0	even though it comes with instructions it is way too complicated to use i was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing not to mention it shrunk 2 feet after i washed it \( following the instructions mind you \) now i have to tighten it in the back versus the front it 's now destined for the donation pile the baby bjorn is easier to use	12
0	i bought the volo after reading many reviews however it was utter disappointment as soon as i took out the stroller from a box and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece yes the stroller is light and very very flimsy i returned it right away	12
0	this is the most stupid product you can buy it makes opening doors even easier maybe instead of selling this as a door knob lock it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis this does n't even deserve one star	12
0	we just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by safety 1st and parents this cover lasted about one minute seriously ! by the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors my son had opened the first one my husband had installed the tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open	12
0	i installed this mirror in our car two days ago today it was in my daughter 's lap when i went to get her out of the car the mirror broke off from the base i bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors \( suction cup attachment etc \) i would not recommend this product	12
0	bought this mirror at target along with many other eddie bauer baby products available there this mirror is hard to install and everytime you hit a bump it falls down rendering it useless it is just very poorly made from cheap materials i am very disappointed with the eddie bauer line at target almost every eddie bauer product i bought ended up breaking in a week or i just returned due to such poor design target needs to stop selling these items they are a waste of money	12
0	we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature which worked a little too good the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out i 'd hit it and knock it out of place so i had to readjust it all over again sometimes when we 'd hit bumps it would fall and become worthless finally my little girl 's arms got long enough that she could reach it and it ended up breaking	12
0	we received this thermometer as a baby shower gift for a few months it worked very well easy to use after about 8 months it started acting strange giving us inaccurate readings the final straw was when the thermometer read 104 8 degrees sending us to the er at midnight only to find out our son 's temperature was n't even over 100 the thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital	12
0	when i purchased these drapes i assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the zanzibar valences sheets etc wrong ! the material is striped and is a darker different shade of brown than the rest of the set i love the other items in this set but do n't waste your money on these drapes they look awful	12
0	i really was disappointed with this product our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile	12
0	did not stick to tile sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner	12
0	decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath but one side does n't seem to want to stick to the walls	12
0	i ca n't get it to stick ! i might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold but as soon as i put toys in it it falls	12
0	the whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub but that is impossible since it wo n't stick to tile above the tub i had n't even put any toys in it and it would n't stick i returned it and found something on one step ahead	12
0	terrible terrible terrible the first one broke within 5 uses the second one lasted about 15 uses there have got to be better ones out there	12
0	the suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter my 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals they crinkle and delight her	12
0	the suctions are pretty weak dont stick well to the tray also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick as soon as my son would touch it it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time i took this back the next day i bought the sassy fascination station instead it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray	12
0	this is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and do n't stick to my son 's highchair at all very disappointing	12
0	for some reason the product was not delivered ups returned it this was send for charity after many emails and phone calls the company refuses to respond or refund the money shipping was more than the product	12
0	this item is packaged horribly if you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price received changing hutch and tower crib and toybox intact very happy ordered this dresser twice both times damaged good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6 8 plus weeks my suggestion is to order two dressers take the best pieces from each and return the rest believe me you will be glad you did	12
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
0	do not order this item ! i ordered and returned this item four times due to cracked pieces storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage i refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture what a disaster and diappointment	12
0	this brand is just awful ! it 's made of cheap flimsy particle board it dents and dings very easily most inportantly the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out not only is it horribly made but it 's dangerous ! do not buy !	12
0	this item is packaged very poorly you have to literally rip the box apart to open it i did this twice and both times the very last item was completely cracked in half very inconveniently shipped and packaged	12
0	i own these bottles they seemed nice but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle im thowing mine out	12
0	i have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and i am not impressed my daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas i experimented with the dr brown bottle and the playtex vent air both seemed to help but the playtex is by far the best people complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable	12
0	i used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose the first time it happened i thought i did n't screw the top on but then it happened again after doing some research this is a common problem with these bottles	12
0	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies i bought a starter kit and several other bottles i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid nothing helped my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them i switched to another brand and now we are very dry	12
0	does n't stay in place too expensive i do better with a waterproof diaper changing pad ! i cut slits in it for the buckle and straps to go through and it works tons better save your money on this one	12
0	these do n't fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large i'm not sure how but if possible verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer	12
0	i ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken the first two times i ordered it through walmart com because it 's cheaper but they would n't replace the part the third time i ordered it through babyage com and was able to replace the part but i'm still waiting on it this is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set but it 's a major pain i originally ordered it in july and to re order and send it back three times has taken 5 months my son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser	12
0	i was very excited to receive the armoire this past weekend however after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces i called strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue the only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part the rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3 4 weeks with the baby coming in within a week or so who has the time to wait the product is what you pay for	12
0	i was very disappointed in the product the picture does not accurately represent the armoire the entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood not cherry wood at all the pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet in addition to the outside also pieces did come chipped cracked and one piece was also split into two ! ! ! i returned the item and wish i had n't ordered in the first place	12
0	this potty is completely useless it is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it it is unstable on those little plastic legs and it 's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it this potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless	12
0	i was so excited to find a portable potty b c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training well i opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment ! my son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time it 's too small and pinches i tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable no positioning worked if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it otherwise skip this one	12
0	i took this on a short trip it proved useless it 's unstable has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby 's bottom i ca n't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this especially a potty training child \? my daughter was fairly young when we tried it \( we did some early pt and she was about 10 months old \) she 's now 2 fully pt but will still not go near it if it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old how would it do under the weight of an older child \? beyond me i still give it 2 stars because it 's an otherwise neat idea impractical execution though	12
0	this piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces the directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle ! but the actual parts are n't labeled so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean when finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable also as many of the holes are not lined up so i could n't even put in some of the bolts	12
0	this was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm but the zipper does not work well and it broke already i tried to repair it but after that broke the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix i would not recommend this jj cole product as i had the same problem with another one we inherited	12
0	i thought these would be great specially for the but i was soo wrong ! ! i 've only washed them once to have everything clean b f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls ! ! the fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls way to many to even remove by hand and on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam ! ! ! it looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand me down after one wash ! ! do not waste your time or money ! !	12
0	this lock works good for a little while then the push mechanism breaks it may or may not break completely off so it could still work even when it breaks i 've gone through two of these already and they only lasted a few months before they broke	12
0	i have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers if i install this lock the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening it also means that i would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet i'm returning it	12
0	once we took this net out of the box i knew it would n't work our balcony railing was not only longer but shorter in height than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing the quot strings quot used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous i am searching for an alternative	12
0	do n't waste your money on this high chair by the time your infant can safely sit in it they will have almost outgrown it you 're just paying for the name brand not the quality stick w a graco instead	12
0	our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed \( and i'm an industrial designer dad so i should know ! \) it can hit the door frame easily the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height he 's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it he has fun in it at first but it always seem a disappointment in the end save your time and money and get the baby einstein excersaucer that is agreat toy and better for development skills	12
0	serious warning consumer reports the independent consumer magazine called a specific model of this walker model 14565 unacceptable because it 's unsafe \( see their dec 8 2006 blog on their website \) anohter similar model 14570 is okay model 14565 is deemed unsafe by cr because it does not prevent the walker and the baby from falling downstairs as it should cr points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel unfortunately it 's impossible to tell which model amazon is selling your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store be sure to avoid model 14565	12
0	this thermometer is totally worthless it does n't read the correct temp on myself husband or baby when my little one was sick at 3 months old this thing read 96 7 degrees on all three of us i picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm works great cost me 3 i ca n't give this one away	12
0	maybe it 's just me but i can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature	12
0	i have looked everywhere and there are no probe covers to be found anywhere ! who would sell a 30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times ! this is insane if anyone finds them please let me know where i have checked babysrus usa baby wal mart target walgreens snyder 's drugstores every grocery store every discount store every drugstore i have been to in two states over the last 3 months this is crazy i recommend not getting it	12
0	i have only found one place to buy probe covers for this thing so i bought a lot they are n't the same manufacturer but they are the exact type of probe covers hope this helps others looking for covers for this if the first years does n't sell probe covers for this anymore they should n't let companies sell the thermometer either http www shoplet com office db g2512530 htm	12
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	12
0	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore cannot return the item i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future	12
0	the idea of a nice warm wipe is great but the product falls short in perfomance the warmer is designed for a non popup type of wipe box \( if you use pop up wipes just the part sticking out of the box gets warm and the rest is cold if you use the other type of wipe box it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full which is n't always realistic for a moms and dads i am returning mine to the store	12
0	only the top 1 4 of the wipes are warm if you do n't refill the container continously wipes get cold plus you might consider the ease of use with a pop up warmer	12
0	i purchased this wipe warmer because i did n't want a warmer that heats all the wipes those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless the top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes well this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box it did n't even heat the whole wipe ! i am returning the warmer it is a complete waste of money	12
0	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep but it did n't work worst yet her head would slide off the edge i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around	12
0	i like the concept of an elevated design they should make the sides breathable i have had my son sleeping on this since he came home this has been 6 weeks so far he twitches and moves his legs and arms and such typical baby stuff he ends up slidding down in between the wedges i tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up you would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in he slides no matter what when i put the towell to high his head slid off the edge good idea needs work	12
0	this product has been a disappointment the pillow portion is good in theory only the baby 's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not ! so the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right ! would n't recommend good concept bad design	12
0	my wife purchased this toy box at our local toys r us it went together fine but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like wet paint in fact we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room little tykes makes this unit but they were of no help when i called customer satisfaction they told me just to return it and that they 've never heard of this problem	12
0	the toy box is nice but im not happy with the product the directions were difficult to understand and i did n't like the top being made of cloth material my little boy already made a tear on it i had to remove it i was afraid my little boy would tear it	12
0	hi i bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension i was so wrong ! if your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure there are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either i ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub but i have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it it has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play so if you are searching for a bath seat i dont recommend the safety 1st at all	12
0	unless you have an older inexpensive bathtub this wo n't work the side pad wo n't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat wo n't go deep enough too bad it looked great !	12
0	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks its been 3 weeks when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks how hard is it to get replacements \? \? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college we purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it	12
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
0	there was a crack down the side where it was put together and nicks in the wood we didn't have time to send it back and they only offered us 20 oo for a discount very dissastisfied ! will never order form here agai	12
0	i used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since i'm engorged and found out the motor is broken i'm very disappointed since i trusted the medela name if i could afford it i 'd replace it with the pump in style but unfortunately i 'll have to try a manual pump	12
0	i bought this pump the day i was discharged from the hospital \( 12 11 05 \) i have used it on a part time basis since i am staying home and nurse directly however the motor broke and could n't pump anymore my baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke i have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby i was lucky to call medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so i could get my money back	12
0	this is not a good product unless you 're willing to screw one of the parts into your door which we were not since it was a newly installed hi quality door and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so as a result the double backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off you ca n't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person \( large or small \) trying to open the door it just is n't going to hold up it 's a nice try but in the end was a waste of my money	12
0	i ordered two of these cots for twin 4 year old grandsons to use when staying at my home i expected the cots to be fairly sturdy perhaps along the line of a porta crib instead the frame does n't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily the twins tried them out after being cautioned not to jump on them the cots did n't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them i returned the cots to target	12
0	i did not like this hammock it cuts across your neck and i do not feel like my son is securely in there i always have to have at least one hand holding him the front carriers are the way to go since they leave your hands free to do things	12
0	i thought i would love this but just returned it it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time \( 10 minutes \? \) maybe i'm too small \( 5'2 \) or my baby \( 5 months and 18 pounds \) is too large either way i still find the bjorn much more comfortable i would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the bjorn but i could n't stand wearing ! very painful	12
0	how annoying to pay 25 more here than at walmart same price at babies r us is it really the same exact thing \? very frustrating	12
0	i found all of the avent cups really hard to clean ! i could n't get the stopper out of the top of the cup the playtex cups are way easier to use !	12
0	loved the car seat until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat	12
0	loved our marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat since this happened he 's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place just by loosening the harness although a highly rated seat i would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product i have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this not very happy	12
0	not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants it is not high enough and very combersome to use its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub however the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger	12
0	i inherited this product from my neightbor last week i have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it i cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart i would love to try this product but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly it will not be used what a shame baby products should be made so that they clean up easily	12
0	i had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub i would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off i ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad but then it became just an expensive knee stool the knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why i give it 2 stars rather than 1 i returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price	12
0	the colors are very diferent they supposed to be blue yellow and white and i recived in a pale yellow the material is not very good i do n't recomend this product	12
0	the image showing for this spoon set is not correct the image is for bendable spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old when you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant	12
0	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier this bag was ok to start and fit my britax \( a feat in itself \) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke i would not buy it i emailed the company and have yet to hear back	12
0	recieved the gate with parts missing when i notified amazon they indicated repair replacement parts were not available and i would have to return and reorder the product as my wife needed it this was not possible this is not a reflection of amazon but on hte manufacturer	12
0	even though i think this is a very good idea \( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand alone potty \) the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well we have the oblong seats not the round ones and the ring slides back and forth especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it it does n't make her feel very stable so so far at least she has refused to use it	12
0	this toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy the splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin it can be quite painful i plan on trying the baby bjorn seat it looks like it would be more comfortabl	12
0	i was so excited to buy my son a potty seat he is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months he picked out the pooh and loved it and i love the splash guard unfortunately the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor he is not leaning over to the floor the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor this seat is quite tipsy	12
0	i was very disppointed in this product i found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer but this was the only good quality i had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching you could smell the plastic in the milk i'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals especially when her liver is n't developed enough to fully detoxify them i really wanted to love this product but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option	12
0	1 they leak2 too expensive3 they do n't supply enough lids so you have to buy more containers4 does n't work well for feedin	12
0	i have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time i reached home	12
0	i bought the isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time after using the ones that came with the pump a few times i did n't like them they are good in the fridge but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing i returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead they were a little more expensive but well worth it i love those and highly reccomend them they also sell just the sealing disc if you already have plenty of bottles	12
0	i wish i had put storage bags on my registry instead they work okay as a multipurpose container but my freezer is full of these things moreover i got the 8 oz ones so they are only 1 2 full as my newborn only drinks 3 4 oz right now one of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately plus you need an adapter to fit the pump something i didnt know i needed and did n't get another waste of money from avent	12
0	they are messy when they opened i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much i do n't have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it 's like 17 for ten	12
0	i did n't like these for a few reasons they take up too much room in my freezer they take too long to thaw i do n't care for the avent isis pump i have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and i can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker	12
0	great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction it would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table really	12
0	i am returning my roxy safe seat ! it was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door the material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat at a grocery store the seat just fits into the whole cart and i have no room for groceries its not worth the hastle i admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy the seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place sorry graco the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	12
0	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	12
0	well we ordered this for a trip and it 's delayed even though it says it 's in stock we got a vauge email that says delayed but no promise of delivery do n't order it from amazon if you 're exhausted chasing an escaping baby ! go to a local store and purchase it waiting waiting waiting	12
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile possibly injuring or killing your child do not buy !	12
0	with the rear facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan this mirror limits driver visability when the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror a large section of the back windshield is blocked i'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror	12
0	i bought this thinking it would be great but have been very disappointed the suction cups do n't stick very well \( especially on wood \) even if you wet them first my daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor	12
0	i do n't even know where to begin eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids \( 1 1 2 and 6 months old \) instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him she would cover her face and cry ! he would go off all by himself which was really creepy in the middle of the night and he broke after a couple of months now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house he 's defantly not worth the mone	12
0	it is very difficult to attach it to anything the straps are to short and under strange angel my son did not play with it	12
1	my daughter loves this activity center i wish they would change two things about it i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up	12
1	i purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old at first he seemed a little intimidated by the toys and would cry when i put him in it once he got used to it he really enjoyed it now he plays with all the toys and he likes that it wobbles around his favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads i did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about just lucky i guess the seat is really hard to remove for washing which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of	12
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was once he was walking he did n't use it again	12
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5 10 minutes a day the jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he 's been fine he does n't play with the toy attachment i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	12
1	i received this gerber gift set for my baby shower the products lather up really well and they smell great ! they are gentle and they do n't make my daughter get a rash you get a lot of product for the price too my daughter really relaxes with the lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the menthol wash when she had a cold now that my daughter is teething she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin the moisturizing stick works great for this we love this gift set and would recommend it	12
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
1	this is the first baby monitor we 've tried and we are quite happy with it we did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability i like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall i do n't really like to use the voice activated mode but my husband does and says it works great when in the normal mode i can hear little birds outside my baby 's window and cars passing our house it 's quite sensitive ! i also like the lights on the receiver you can turn the volume all the way down if you 're watching a movie or something	12
1	in terms of pre natal resources this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven i can not think of a reason not to buy this product every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting	12
1	i purchased this item \( not from amazon \) and my child loved it ! the puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great not the usual 'kid drivel' that usually is part of any kid item some hbb 's come with contemporary music and i will be picking up one of those soon highly recommended	12
1	what a great product it really keeps the baby warm even in the coldest winter when the wind is whipping the generous front flap flips up over the carrying arm of the baby seat and also keeps the baby warm no fussy coats and hundreds of blankets i hope to use it next winter also	12
1	i got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it ! this playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up i'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it i received great reviews on this gear also so do n't be dissapointed to grab one like it ! ! ! awesome playpen ! !	12
1	i received this pack n' play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up it is very colorful and the the toys are cute it was very easy to set up i am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total the matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead it is very multi functional	12
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
1	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system i feel like i am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way while using babyplus the battery cover clips snapped off i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts	12
1	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side to side swinging action really calmed their babies colic i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing no colic this time but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top she follows them around with her eyes very stimulating for the young ones	12
1	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12
1	our 21 month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it ! it does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys the sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or i need to use our regular tub	12
1	i purchases this basket for a friend i was very pleased with its usefullness style it arrived in two days of ordering	12
1	i am a mother of 6 and this works you can put a few baby neccessities in it i use it for a few diapers baby wipes desitin and the bulb syringe i can move it around and it does not take much space	12
1	i orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things it got too heavy everything would n't fit so now i use it to hold his baby tylenol etc it is really nice	12
1	i purchased this to put on the changing table i was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers wipes lotions etc i purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then i found this one it fits perfectly and holds the wipes container several diapers lotion hair brush etc i love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over this allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby the price was also reasonable i was looking at buying one from pottery barn for twice the amount this basket is a great buy	12
1	great product son enjoys being in the chair he especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray only thing i do n't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion	12
1	my mother in law bought these for my daughter at first i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be but my daughter took to them right away in the beginning she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up they wo n't entertain her for hours but she 's always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day	12
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12
1	my 6 month old got these for christmas they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg but it broke i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	12
1	my son loves these blocks we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set he loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them	12
1	my daughter loves this toy ! all the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break too	12
1	my daughter loves this activity center i wish they would change two things about it i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up	12
1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was once he was walking he did n't use it again	12
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5 10 minutes a day the jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he 's been fine he does n't play with the toy attachment i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	12
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
1	i 've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor we have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference i 've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception i think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it	12
1	my husband and i adore this monitor it picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great we occasionally get some interference but all i have to do is move the monitor and it goes away the interference never occurs on the unit in my baby 's room just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up i love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house i plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long ! you can defintely trust this monitor	12
1	we live in the cold rainy northwest part of the country this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat he stays warm and protected in the bundle me this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby it is a must for winter babies it is well worth the money	12
1	this is a great pack'n'play it 's easy to set up and take any place the bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that i have the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby 's attention my only problem is the piece for the top whenever i try to use it the arms bow in and it does n't look very sturdy i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground it just does n't seem very sturdy and i have tried everything other than that i am glad that i bought this !	12
1	my little girl loves this play space ! the colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that i can get dinner on or help with home work the only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes	12
1	i think for your money you get a great value for this playard it comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this it also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with the mattress seems very comfortable and i bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others it has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops the mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars	12
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
1	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side to side swinging action really calmed their babies colic i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing no colic this time but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top she follows them around with her eyes very stimulating for the young ones	12
1	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12

1	i buy a lot of stuff from amazon this bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as i bought it the price reduced on amazon this had been a constant problem on amazon and i think somebody should do something about it i think i should get a refund \) thanks shobhn	12
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12

1	my son loves these blocks we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set he loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them	12
1	i really liked this swing i have the older model papasan swing nothing was wrong with it i just wanted the new model i loved the pink and the fact that i could plug it in	12
1	i like this product it is very stylish and lightweight definitely i highly recommend to anyone	12
1	i love the bather i hated the old plastic ones with this my daughter is more comfortable and does n't cry when i give her a bath i wish i had it with my first child	12
1	we loved the wedge for our little boy he slept on it until he outgrew it it really helped him breathe better when he had a stuffy nose	12
1	we had a very fussy baby and we used these and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned i was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape i considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so i could use it over with child number two	12
1	pros 900mhz communication for less interference and long range rechargeable batteries 10 channel selection lcd display showing signal strength battery gauge channel alerts if monitor has different channel then base visual light indicator for voicecons no light on the basebought this model after trying out 49mhz version	12
1	i love this bra ! it is very comfortable i hardly notice i have it on the soft stretchy material is perfect the closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them i am glad i bought this nursing bra and i highly recommend it	12
1	i love this bra ! i have 2 so that one is always in the wash it is the most comfrotable thing i have ever put on i bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in it was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra i felt so much better after i put it on for the first time i felt like i could breathe again	12
1	i bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one this is the only one i still wear traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes i bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when i go out i sleep in the medela bra and wear it around the house i am quite large breasted and i find they have plenty of support i even do low impact aerobics in it it is worth every penny	12
1	this is the most wonderful and handy kit i have ever had everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case it is just wonderful ! ! ! !	12
1	i do n't have twins however i have an infant and a toddler and it worksgreat for them i go jogging every morning with the kids andit is the most comfortable stroller i have used yet thank you ! !	12
1	my mom always said that the rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me i found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and i like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so i dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what \? my brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old	12
1	we registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby upon receiving it as a shower gift i knew this was going to be great i love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in it 's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag this is a must have for every new parent	12
1	i had wished that i had bought this potty chair from the very begining i bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking i never could find the place that is was leaking so i purchased babybjorn green potty chair my son loved it the moment that i took it out of the box he wanted to use it in the family room i love it because it is only 2 pieces it 's so super easy to clean and it is green my sons favorite color great price and great size i recommend this item	12
1	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on he would n't use that potty but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it the bjorn is shaped perfectly with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee it 's so comfy that he will sit and read a book ! looks great too simple and easy to clean	12
1	just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and practice so far so good	12
1	my daughter was flying to virginia beach virginia to see her husband off to kuwait where he is serving our country she flew alone with two toddlers one still in diapers i had bought her a jeep brand double umbrella stroller i purchased this to free her hands up and help her navigate the airport alone now that she is home she has raved repeatedly how super helpful this item was it was thee most helpful item i purchased for he	12
1	finally ! the joovy is the best double stroller out there it was just missing one key element a cup holder organizer for parents well here it is ! i would imagine these will eventually be included with the stroller but for now if you buy the stroller this is a must	12
1	this was a great addition to the joovy caboose stand on tandem i can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse have everything discreetly on hand and not have to lug around yet another bag organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and does n't shift around at all have found this product to be really helpful	12
1	we love this item i was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink this item solved the problem highly recommended	12
1	the wedge along with a vaporizer helps my three month old sleep better at night sometimes she slides down but she used to slide around before the wedge too most nights she stays on the wedge just as i positioned her and i think it helps with winter 's stuffy noses it 's easy to use and not that expensive	12
1	i am very pleased with this product it arrived quickly same as pictured keeps baby in place insuring a goodnights sleep im glad the headrest was not elevated elevated positioners make baby sink into bedding and could cause suffication again im pleased would purchase for any future children i might have	12
1	i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges one more thing this comes with a mat this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick	12
1	bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room the entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly works well looks good and feels solid highly recommend for this use	12
1	this gate us a lifesaver not only do i pets i have a very adventurus toddler this gate is sturdy and very durable it is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight my living room has a curve to it so it fits great a wonderful item thank you	12
1	i just love our snack trap cups ! my 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys doing it himself they 're great for shopping driving or anywhere ! absolutely no spills ! highly reccommend this product ! happy mom of 1 so fa	12
1	i love this product ! i works graet as a barrier between your little one and whatever surface he or she is on \( e g a car seat high chair stroller etc \) it really saves you from having to wash your furniture when the little one has bathroom accidents that leak out of their diapers it is great for any aged baby infant toddler it will really make your life easier i highly recommend it	12
1	we have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece they are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market they are made well stand up to a lot of washing and are soft and comfortable for baby the dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months not for a newborn we started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night all you need over pj 's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable a great night 's sleep for all !	12
1	my baby loves it by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture i was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect	12
1	i registered for this item as one of those i would n't buy it but it 's a nice thing to have i did receive it and am so glad i did my son loves this ! ! he gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger i would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if i needed them	12
1	this item is a godsend and one of the most useful things i received ! i cannot imagine my day without it my daughter loves it !	12
1	what a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter when my son wants me to play a game puzzle or play on the floor i just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time i have also found it helpful when i fold laundry i can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what i am doing it props the baby 's head up just enough better than just laying flat on the floor the lounger also cradles the baby i wish that i had found this when my son was a baby i recomend this lounger to every new mommy	12
1	this is a super cute bath toy my daughter enjoys putting her toys into the sink and then pulling them back out again she also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this love it	12
1	i got this tray for my son 's daily rides in the car and it has been terrific ! he can eat on it put his sippy cup into the cup holder and be totally independent he can also play on it cars crayons etc and it holds his books too after approximately 9 months of constant use it cracked \( it is very stiff of course but i do n't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked \) worth the money as far as i am concerned	12
1	i love this cover because it is so comfy for the baby ! i have had my boppy for almost a year now and i used it the whole time i nursed my baby love it	12
1	this is an awfully cute bedding set and i'm very pleased with it it arrived quickly and is good quality though the fitted sheet is a little thin it will still be a good backup	12
1	if you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow ! ! ! they are awesome and easy you can wash them they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere love it ! ! !	12
1	very efficiently drains about as much milk as i can get with the pump in style advanced for me and very portable and easy to clean i use it when i have a little more time or when i do n't expect to pump more than a couple ounces \( between feedings \) despite medela 's warnings i would say you could use this to pump daily aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast \( massage \) but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row	12
1	i have had the harmony for seven months and use it about 2 3 times a day it it still working great with all the original parts i have not had to buy replacement anything i do admit i recently tried another pump it was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby with in two days i called the company i got a refund and am back to my harmony this is a great pump and i am so happy that we bought it stop searching and buy this pump	12
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces it is also more stable than others we used we like it	12
1	i love this simply designed sturdy potty my son loves it which is most important he has no trouble sitting down on it no pinching no crampedness no tipping over the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product great price i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's	12
1	i bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features overall i am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it but few things i wish it had is one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention overall for the price it is good	12
1	i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased it works great for my new pomeranian puppies the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it i feel the gate is great for animals i have not used it with children as of this time	12
1	my daughter was the most happy when she was in her halo i love these sleep blankets the cotton ones for use in florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece i wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits i recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers	12
1	once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks i was glad i bought these halo sleepsacks they are made from awesome fabrics and i like that the zipper ends at their feet \( for easy diaper changes \) i highly recommend these to any new mom \( or experienced mom \) it left me assured that my daughter did n't wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head she is a active baby in her crib	12
1	there is a place for everything in this drying station i use wide mouth bottles and it 's a little tight on space but it works great for me it 's convenient on the counter when i have to grab a bottle for the baby	12
1	i really like this i have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess i think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what my bottles fit just fine i use the avent bottles	12
1	this is a great organizer i read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until i received this one it is great ! we use the avent bottles and they and all of their parts fit very well there are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers it did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter but once we mastered that all is well	12
1	my son is and aside from getting too big for his crib my sister is having a baby and needs it i was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his crib attachment but this bed made it easy as pie it 's adorable sturdy and fun my little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we 've never had a problem \( we 've had it for a month \) he loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying choo choo it 's just been great i'm so glad we spent the money	12
1	this lock gives piece of mind it 's easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open it 's sturdy and does n't require drilling into any cabinetry i started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house	12
1	our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat we love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding i was looking forward to the reclining feature as well but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature	12
1	we have a very small kitchen so i knew i could never have a large highchair i registered for the healthy chair by fisher price but after putting my son in it once to try it out i returned it for this one and never regretted it this one has a higher back reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable \( the one i have is better than the one shown i bought it at babiesrus \) it actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc 123 plastic mats that go on the tray my son is very comfortable in it and i love that we can take it anywhere	12
1	i ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we 're out strolling in the sun it does a pretty good job only my son 's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined \( my only beef about the product \) but i can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem i like the fact that the shade protects from uv rays and is easily adjustable i leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached i think the side pouches are an excellent plus i am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family	12
1	my son loves this toy although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color he is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy a good buy and will keep them busy	12
1	if you 're worried about sids \( loose blankets in the crib \) or whether or not your little one is warm at night look no more halo sleepsack wearable cotton or fleece is the way to go ! ! ! ! i love them and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights	12
1	i 've had the hippo faucet cover for over six months and i think it 's great ! my son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt it is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise i think it 's worth it ! the only problem i found with the hippo cover is that it does n't really dispense bubble bath well	12
1	this thing cracks us up ! we ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it he can play with it but its secure enough that he ca n't pull it off it was also an absolute necessity for us now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet it puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time	12
1	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help \( after she was diagnosed we were given zantac but still used this as well ! \) it 's a true godsend we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon it is expensive but it is completely worth the price we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	12
1	works great we tried other brands of gripe water which did n't seem to do much something about baby 's bliss does the trick	12
1	my two year old son loves this talking phone he carries the thing everywhere we love the time and quailty that he spends playing with this wonderful toy	12
1	we also used this netting last spring summer fall on our double stroller \( limosine style \) and our pack n play in addition to bugs it keeps leaves etc from falling into the play pen my in laws loaned us a second play pen that was older and larger than the one 's sold these days the netting also fit that but not as snugly	12
1	i actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby 's cradle \( we have two cats and did n't want them to nap in it while the baby was n't in it \) i 've used it once for my pak n' play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood since it was such a nice day i let her nap in in the stroller \( it fully reclines \) with netting covering the entire stroller i feel that for such a low price this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for	12
1	the pack and play netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your pack and play outside the netting keeps the bugs out ! it is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag it also fits easily over the graco pack and plays	12
1	as i am not personally using this i can only pass on what i have been told it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away	12
1	with both the basic fence 5 piece hearthgate system and a great fit with the decor of our home highly recommend the entire system kare	12
1	not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly i just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble assemble is probably too strong a word there is no actual assembly or tools involved as for the weight maybe 15 pounds certainly nowhere near 50 the instructions seemed sufficient although i did n't really need to use them basically if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern do n't let that stand in the way of choosing this item	12
1	i think this is a great quality product and i love the idea of it however i find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it it 's not very soft and it 's just so big for him right now i can get him to sleep in it only if he 's completely zonked out beforehand i think the mini co sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning the original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it i do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many many times	12
1	very easy to use and comfortable it did n't bother my daughter when she was asleep stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year	12
1	i love this item it has soothing music sounds and animation easy operation baby loves it too arrived quickly and well packaged instructions on manufacturers box thanks fisher pric	12
1	i ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up and not just the sides this is also sometimes refered to as a 4 sided changing pad since all 4 edges are raised it seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser effectively converting the dresser to a changing table the only reason i did n't rate this higher was that it did n't include a non skid pad on the bottom of the pad also it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover next i need to order some covers for it since the baby does n't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface i am not sure which covers to order	12
1	my son is tiny born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie i simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this it keeps his entire body in place not just his head it provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm \( we havnt used the other side yet \) my only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny once he s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem	12
1	the snuzzler works well for our small baby in his graco metrolite stroller it supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it	12
1	i like this car seat it is very soft for a bab	12
1	this carseat is a good value the pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow i did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that 's expected in a 4 month old it reclines far enough that her head does n't fall forward and it 's so simple to adjust the straps overall very nice carseat for the money i spent	12
1	i got one of these for my baby shower i loved it so much i went back and bought another one very easy to use i just put my baby in it before she 's going to sleep for the night there is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack puts your mind at ease no loose blankets in the crib ! ! also reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights	12
1	this pillow has become my preganant wife 's best freind she snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me	12
1	this was a baby shower gift and although the baby is still too little to use it i can say that it is exactly as described and the parents were thrilled to receive it	12
1	these are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself whenever we are out at a restaurant i just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table who knows what they wipe those tables with \? ! this is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on	12
1	these placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table especially for when you 're out in public places they stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at \( my son is obsessed with anything sesame street esp elmo so he loves staring at the placemat \) they 're easy to fit into any purse diaper bag pocket so they 're always accessible	12
1	love these i use them everywhere i really ca n't imagine not having them since my son throws down all plates and napkins still	12
1	i would n't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a table topper for each of them the self sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant table germs i wish i had thought of these ! ! they 're a great invention for families on the go	12
1	this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them ! ! super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were 2 per package fyi they 're not ! ! only one per	12
1	i received this as a baby shower gift from my mom and love it ! it is so easy to manuever you can do it with one hand the stroller has ample space for bags purse etc below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items the drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus the material is so pretty and the colors are great the best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather i would highly recommend this item	12
1	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old we feed our daughter with bottles \( mix formula with breast milk \) and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref \( my wife did breast bumping \) and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time also when we travel out this one is quite useful generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag \( well not compact bag though \)	12
1	i think that this is a great stroller for traveling i have a 4 year old and she loved riding in it we used it on our vacation to disney world and it was wonderful for all of the walking we had to do it fit in tight spaces and was very easy to manuever it was light weight and easy to use overall i am glad that i had this great strolle	12
1	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1 2 months old she 's now 2 1 2 and we 've never had any problems with it this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall park etc the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too we 've never used the rain cover so i ca n't comment on that it does n't have a storage basket but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do for longer trips we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light quick outing stroller to keep in the car	12
1	i love this bath tub ! we were not happy with my son 's infant bath tub so we were anxious to move into this one ! it fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs when you 're done with it it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry the best part is that we 'll be able to deflate it and store it easily it 's also great for traveling	12
1	i actually got the snug tub deluxe this version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post it also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it i used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play my only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping i put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up this was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping i'm glad i bought this instead of the eurobath	12
1	we bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats he was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly could n't handle the full size version this tub is a perfect in between option the only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub	12
1	my son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year it is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub does n't accomdate the rings in fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand ours has withstood a year of use so far and we 'll be using it with the next baby too	12
1	i have used this system for 9 weeks now the bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly i test shake before i feed and if its wrong i unscrew and reseat the nipple my daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the playtex bottles i tried if your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple i use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples i have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and i like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time these bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily	12
1	this is a great item i paid 17 95 for it at walmart though ! get it there	12
1	i am a pretty picky shopper but i have fallen in love with this product my now 6 1 2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place i could ever get her to sleep comfortably she still sleeps in it \( at 18 pounds it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out \) there is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies save the money you 'd spend on a co sleeper swing or a bassinet and try this instead i buy it for every baby shower i attend	12
1	we love this glider as does our 6 week old ! she has reflux so this has been a life saver ! she sleeps in it and enjoys the gentle gliding back and forth as she falls alsleep we swaddle her and tuck her turn on the side to side glide and set her womb bear on the edge of the glider off to slumber land she goes we highly recommend this	12
1	this product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night especially since she ca n't kick off the blankets i highly recommend it sizing is different than baby r us i'm probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought i 'd provide info x small \( newborn \) 5 to 10 lbssmall \( up to 6 months \) 10 to 18 lbsmedium \( 6 12 months \) 16 to 24 lbslarge \( 12 18 months \) 22 to 28 lbsx large \( 18 24 months \) 26 to 36 lb	12
1	i have n't been able to find the sizing info for the sleepsacks on this site so i called the right start \( they also carry them but for 24 99 \) and they said that the large size is for 22 28 pounds just thought i 'd put this info out there for everyone hope it helps	12
1	as we all know you 're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent sids the sleepsack is a great product ! it keeps baby nice and warm yet you do n't have to worry about a blanket and there 's space down in the bottom for his feet so he 's not too restricted also the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom so you do n't have a big zipper poking baby in the face	12
1	would someone be able to give me the dimensions measurements for this mattress \? thanks so much ! i do not have this however it made me put in a rating in order to post a question	12
1	i bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son and we never had any problems easy to clean and firm yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months when we were surprised at the news of a second i bought this from amazon on sale the fabric design is different \( blue and white checks \) but otherwise it seems the same to me but one comment if you do n't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around 20 it depends on what you 're willing to pay for convenience	12
1	we purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping she always woke up congested and strangled since we started using the wedge she has n't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now	12
1	i would like to ditto \( and thank ! \) the reviewer who suggested the cvs brand covers after reading her review i purchased the covers from cvs com then i thought about checking at walgreen 's and sure enough they carry them \( same price as cvs 40 for 5 99 \) i just picked up a box today so i will soon have a bunch of covers but i do n't care i just love this thermometer i actually have the one with the light on it outstanding product	12
1	i love the plug in feature there 's been many times i 've left the swing on \( have to rush to change a diaper and left it on \) true it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls the swing is n't incredibly fast but for my 2 month old it 's worked well there are two volume levels for the music but i 've only used the lowest setting	12
1	this high chair is so easy to put together and use my grand daughter loves this chair the music and toys on top occupy her i like how it changes height and reclines my grand daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months the recline position came in handy ! i would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family	12
1	i love this chair and so does my 6 month old it 's super easy to clean to recline the seat or to adjust the height the toy that comes with it is cute too i love the music it plays	12
1	i bought this chair for my third child and wish i would 've had it for the first two as well it is easy to assemble easy to use and easy to clean i like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit lay in it at a fairly young age i love the wheels because i could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner the one hand release on the tray is a dream for moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems to enjoy the toys too i only wish it came with extra trays	12
1	love this tub the hammock attachment works well for small infants	12
1	we love this tub still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old the incline position is great when they are n't quite ready to sit on their own we used to just place this over our kitchen sink give her baths there now we place it inside our regular bathtub because she is n't quite ready to be in the big tub yet	12
1	i like this sheet so much better than the thin ones it offers more padding and seems so much more comfy ! it is a tight fit but i had no problem fitting the sheet onto my eddie bauer pack n play so i would assume it should fit any pack n play just make sure to wash in cold water and hang dry i never put this in the dryer the only thing i do n't like is the color it happens to match my navy blue playard but i wish it came in some lighter colors	12
1	i have two children now and i wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born i have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car and nothing worked 100 of the time this however does it is one of the best things i have ever purchased for my child and it 's very inexpensive	12
1	it works really well it 's stable \( the little guy is trying to climb \) and holds a lot	12
1	this is one of the best on the market looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books a must buy	12
1	finally ! a big spacious nice looking toy box ! ! i looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there ! the lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up the drawers on the bottom are small but hold a few things and do n't take anything away from the big interior of the box it makes the box look more sofisticated ! ! love the new colors and design thanks little tikes !	12
1	it fits our baby trend car seat hooks easily to the latch anchor points and in our mid size sedan leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side	12
1	all rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff there 's no avoiding it we squirt them til empty at the end of every bath my kids love the net and little fish as well as the other toys no problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we 've had it over 2 years	12
1	i have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs the gates are attached to the walls i have not had any problems with the either gate for those of you searching for a gate for a dog the gate works will with by 70 pound boxer	12
1	i was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib nothing was inside except the sheets and baby as you can imagine this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails so number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper ! i still worry about sids but i feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy highly recommend	12
1	this is great for young babies once my son became more active \( which is when it 's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway \) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it 's very thin unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w a crib set i think that is the only flaw but i will definitely use it again for my next infant baby	12
1	i replaced my baby 's old bumper with this one when she became mobile it works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats the only complaint i have is that the short section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms legs inside the crib	12
1	this protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby otherwise a good product	12
1	this is one of the best products i have seen for the car seat i am very particular about my car and did not want the leather to get messed up this product is the best and will prevent items from spilling onto the sea	12
1	this seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for suvs in contrast to one of the other reviews \( and i am not affiliated with the seat manufacturer \) this seat does the job adequately and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs measurements fit etc imho there is no quot universal quot seat saver or for that matter car seat that will fit every car this one manages to catch most of the itty bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat and hence serves its purpose well	12
1	i like this because it is a nice construction i bought the white and it blends in nicely i just wish it was a little higher we have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now	12
1	my 3 yr old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair he does n't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair the babybjorn is a bit expensive i found a similar chair at ikea for a fraction of the cost	12
1	if you 're going to get the baby bjorn potty chair you 've got to get a matching stool ! i love how the stool has a rubbery grip top to prevent slipping my son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair you 've gotta get one now	12
1	i really like how this step was designed to stay in place we have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it this one stays put ! the only reason this stool did n't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top it is a little difficult to clean since this is a potty step stool it has gotten some messes on it that i wish would have been easier to get rid of	12
1	i bought this thinking it was a gimic worse case was my daughter would get a night light on her bed turns out this actually works her bedroom is filled with stars she uses it every night and i use it to check on her it is still using the original batteries 30 days the amber color does not work so good but her walls are pink on white it might work better get it for something diffrent that works	12
1	this is a great light shines stars all over the room constellations are n't quite right but they 're close the different color options are great for the price it 's a great deal	12
1	my sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect	12
1	after using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub this one is the best ! i only wish i would 've just bought this one to begin with my little guy is 6 months old 24 pounds but ca n't sit up yet he still uses the side that lays him down in the water and he loves it ! do n't waste your money on other tubs this one is the best this one will grow with your child while saving water too	12
1	i bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and i am so glad i had it ! i used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller there are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it my daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep she loved being able to see everything around her at our level i am 5'3 and my husband is 6'1 and we both wore it comfortably i would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller	12
1	awesome awesome awesome ! my hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality design and function about products and he loves this carrier i liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else he tolerates being in this more than his stroller this was my first choice based on all the feedback thanks	12
1	i bought these sheets online since i could n't find any in the local babies r' us store and did so with hesitation but when i received them i could n't be happier with them the best thing about these sheets besides that they fit perfectly is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug	12
1	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
1	my daughter recently had her second child and spends alot of time breastfeeding this product allows her to pump at her convenience she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child the product works very well she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her but it is an excellent product she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive noisier pump she had before we would highly recommend this product and the product is well worth the price paid	12
1	it 's expensive but worth it it 's nice to take to work because it looks professional \( many people did n't even know what it was \) and it comes with a cooler so i did n't have to put my milk in the fridge next to everyone 's lunch a friend also bought one around the same time and says she got it much cheaper on ebay for a brand new one	12
1	i love this pump ! if you 're going to breastfeed you need this pump it 's expensive but worth the investment i pump at least 10 times a week and it 's just so much easier than the manual pump i tried	12
1	this is so much better than any potty chair and it is never in the way ! very easy to put on and my daughter loves it ! she ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also ! !	12
1	this potty seat is the only toilet training item i have bought i highly recomend it ! my daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty you need a step stool for them to get up on their own i like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb 3 ft 2 yro climbing up situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal this product i feel helps get to that goal	12
1	this sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty on those cold san francisco nights it is really easy to use to move from the carset to the stroller i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides but it 's the best thing around we 've seen	12
1	this fit very easily into my daughter 's graco infant car seat as the other reviewers said it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm wind has not seemed to be a problem but then i only carry her between the car and my destination in it i would recommend this to a friend	12
1	i read some other reviews that were poor but i disagree my son loves this toy he smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room it plays music continually for 12 minutes so in the middle of the night when he wakes up i turn it on and he 's asleep by the time it runs out we have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy however it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees this completely contradicts the interactive play mode since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons	12
1	this is a thin sheet but it fits my full size pack n play bassinet perfectly i would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often	12
1	i purchased this despite the reviews i read out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet it is a little thin however i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway so i am not concerned with absorbancy it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time	12
1	i purchased these for my pack n' play and they are soft and durable a real must have for pack n play owners	12
1	i have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age we love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry just make sure the suction cup is wet and it wo n't fall off the wall sizewize it 's basically a perfect fit in our tub which is slightly tapered from head to toe but i could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub	12
1	when i saw the pictures i thought i could fit both kids they fit but with little room for two no room for play i will purchase another one still a good product safe and sturdy and easy to clean	12
1	it 's kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad it gets the job done it folds rather compactly i think it 's well worth the money	12
1	love it ! fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it	12
1	i expected a sage or mint to come in the package when i ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking i do n't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right kiwi is bette	12
1	i was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews but i did it anyway and i'm glad the covers are durable the color has n't faded and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad i think they 're soft enough for diaper changing i would n't put my baby to sleep on it but then who would	12
1	i bought this beacause i needed my gate to be just a little bit wider it attached very easily and was easy to install also it is very hard to find in stores	12
1	this has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk formula and now baby food jars it heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it i wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child i think that this is a very good investment especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it does n't heat anything evenly ! !	12
1	heats milk and food esecially when frozen i use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food i 've made	12
1	i have used many infant tubs and i love this one ! it folds so nicely i keep it in the kitchen pantry it fits in the sink and i keep the faucet running like a little shower and i can rinse her with fresh water i actually think the angle is great for an infant but with a newborn i use one of those yellow bear sponges in the tub for extra support \( but i use one with all the infant tubs i have used \)	12
1	you do n't need the whole kit only the loop and latch is needed if you use the plastic it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing this way you can use the softfit breastshield too	12
1	this product works great you hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things i am so glad a coworker told me about this product	12
1	well i felt a little silly paying about 20 \( with shipping \) for 2 pieces of plastic 2 bra hooks and some rubber bands however the kit does work and does allow you to pump hands free one word of caution if you use medela 's quick clean steam bags to clean your pump parts take the hands free plastic sleeves off before throwing the bag in the microwave ! otherwise they warp and do n't fit right	12
1	for all new and expecting mothers it 's good to get a little help	12
1	so far i have n't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies \( also we have n't run into issues to need it \) but i have used the nose aspirator and it 's great it 's soft and i do n't fear hurting his nose ! i'm very excited to use the rest of the products	12
1	i wish that it would zip up all the way the top is coming down all the time and i have to adjusted maybe it 's better for a two and up age child	12
1	this product was recently purchased for my 5 1 2 month old son 's stroller by my mother in law i love it i had an older hand me down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better i love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another i only wish it came in more colors color combinations	12
1	we got this seat in a different color for our first baby we feel very secure with it easy to install and a little hint they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars you do n't need it you can fasten the seat without the base the directions for it are on the seat i like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it and that it 's transportable to our stroller \( bough seperatly \) it comes with a head brace whatever those things are called to cradle the head those never do anything and are pretty useless but the seat itself is great	12
1	i did a lot of online and store researching before i bought this seat for my 3 1 2 year old son my one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children well now i can say it works well for slim ones as well he loves the arm rests and the cup holder it is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary we liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	12
1	my husband and i bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son he liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old the seat is incredibly easy to clean \( which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot \) and it 's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we are n't using it both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time	12
1	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	12
1	i was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry i am so glad i did i have only had to empty it about every 6 7days and it is simple and odor free even when full there is no odor ! i didnt need to put in a refill for 3months the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts in comparison its cheaper ! i would recommend this to anyone	12
1	i did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn and the snugfit got the best safety reviews and we just loved the pring perfect for a boy or a girl i had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car but it was a breeze i had it installed in the backseat within five minutes my car has the latch system and it has worked great my daughter loves being in her car seat and i have always felt perfectly safe with her in it i was surprised to read the other reviews since i have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat i would highly recommend this seat to any parent	12
1	i bought this set for use with my second child it helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and i needed to pump i use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with she did not take to the nipples that came with this set but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect the bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with overall i am so happy with the medela bottles and pump ! !	12
1	this is a good quality item for the money i love that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets i just bought a second one for grandma 's house !	12
1	i own this blanket and just bought another ! i brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park it was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me my daughter and all of our stuff a few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too my baby spits up quite a bit especially during tummy time so i decided to buy another one to use in the house it cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth great investment	12
1	i was debating between this analog model and digital models i have never heard the digital models to be honest but this analog model has been great i can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to buy time when i am busy and ca n't get to her immediately i have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about if your family is on a tight budget like mine this is in the best bang for the buck out there today	12
1	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie talkie feature it works well and has a great range the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep	12
1	my baby and i just love it ! ! ! ! it is so easy to bath her now and so much fun ! i started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome she plays with her toys and has tons of fun the side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax after her bath i just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day i really recommend it it is super practical \( please never leave your baby unattended	12
1	we have had this puzzle toy since my son was one \( he 's 3 now \) it has provided hours of entertainment and education we started by just showing him a few choices and matching now he can easily do the whole box himself and enjoys it i like the textures vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces the nice sturdy box to hold them is great too	12
1	the mom who received this gift was very pleased with it	12
1	we love the swaddle me blankets we have the flannel and the fleece this has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night \( in just two weeks of using them \) she loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again with the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer the fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat have not tried the cotton ones definitely worth a try	12
1	hi this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble !	12
1	i love this shade ! i am the mother of 2 girls alice 7 and samantha 22 months i never had anything like this for my oldest it makes such a difference the little one wo n't go out without it ! even though i always used sunblock on alice her skin is still so much darker than samantha 's i really believe it is because of the shade i looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and i think it is the best one on the market the others are made from nylon lycra and i do n't think that would hold up as well as this one does thank you protect a bub	12
1	we looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we 've found i love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down it stores flat and that you can add as many toys as you want our baby has really enjoyed it there is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time	12
1	my little guy loved this from the start this is a versatile toy that lasted many months the mat is machine washable so it became our take along for travel the hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows he 's now 2 yrs and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room ! this was a great investment	12
1	i love this carrier \( i bought it in feb 2007 \) my daughter loves it too she can sleep very well in it the only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb while mine is already 17lb \( she is only 3 months \) i guess i do n't have too much time to use it if this company could develop a one which suits for big baby i will definitely buy it ji	12
1	i definately recommend this product i used it every day for my baby for the first 9 months great both indoors and outdoors !	12
1	the superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it you can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained	12
1	this play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers espicially ones that garden since the invention of disposable diapers ! i bought two and an extension panel which make for an ample size playpen inside i put a little tikes climber a step one ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel and a playskool grow with me picnic table and he still has plenty of room to romp i can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips	12
1	these work really well but be sure to get a couple of the magnets because we lost our first one and then we were all hosed for a while	12
1	the gate works perfectly however it does n't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive i am very handy with tools remodeling etc and i found the installation to take longer than i would have expected the latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top there was a u stamped in it but no mention of that in the instructions nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom how hard would that be \? one sentence \? i went through a dry run and figured it all out but it doubled the installation time \( took 1 hour \)	12
1	i have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room i have read countless reviews of the double faced tape foam pads that come off right away with little effort this product attached exactly as described i had the unit installed as well as the pads measured cut and installed in 10 minutes the taupe color is very discrete on our cream red black brick fireplace i ca n't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced an absolute must for your hearth	12
1	i love my fisher price infant toddler swing i have two of them for my twin boys they love it and i know it is safe also is it easy to get them in and out of lynne ambros	12
1	this is a great sterilizer it 's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings i bought it when my son was born and after a year i'm still using it it works great saves time and has an auto shut off function when the steaming cycle is complete	12
1	my daughter is just learning how to self feed and these placemats are great i 've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are this product solves that problem the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off however i do not find this to be a major problem also i tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table great tip thanks this is a great product for kids learning to eat	12
1	we have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she 's almost 2 now we keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of pocket bibsters whenever we eat out at a restaurant we stick this down at our toddler 's place she sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate it spills onto this nice clean mat the mat also has entertainment value as she can name the items on it after she 's made her mess we just peel the mat off wad it up and throw it away	12
1	i loved this product my baby slept in it until she was able to turn over she resisted swaddling and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib i agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down	12
1	this is a great wipes warmer for use with cloth wipes if you are cloth diapering the wipes are nice and warm and do n't dry out i have seen no rust like one of the other reviews said nightlight is also very nice and gives just enough light to see in the middle of the night i change out the wipes every 3 4 days and have had no problems with mildew	12
1	this mobile is amazing from the time she was 6 weeks old my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music she loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile although it can be noisy it does n't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds a must for any nursery	12
1	its a little hard to adjust but its definitely worth it we 've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller folds away easily and does n't take up a lot of space i also love the pockets on the sides where i can store my keys phone water bottle etc	12
1	used this for double stroller while on vacation in hershey park fantastic ! easy to put on easy to store ! i do n't know why strollers especially doubles have such dinky canopies anyway ! but this did it 's duty	12
1	i bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape we use it to hold all my little girl 's stuffed animals and she has alot of them ! on occasions we do include her heavy toys no problem at all we live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that does n't take up too much space but big enough to store away toys	12
1	this is a very cute table perfect for my 2 kids they like having picnics outside sitting at their table that is just the right size for them as far as assembly my husband put it together rather quickly and it is very sturdy i am pleased with my purchase	12
1	we just bought this for our 3 yr old and he does everything on it ! it is very durable and also light weight so we can move it around easily this table will last well through our second son as well	12
1	well made and well priced your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart buy buy bu	12
1	play table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson \( 18 months \) loves it it is good for small children better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over i wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely	12
1	do n't bother with bulky snowsuits this makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby we live in the north east so it is a life saver yummy snuggly	12
1	i had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat it was awesome i never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough they did tell me at the hospital however that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat this goes underneath them so it probably does but i figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway	12
1	i got this hat because it matched the jj cole bundle me blanket for my son 's car seat he looks absolutely adorable in it but he hates wearing it unfortunately the elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down overall if your baby is a hat wearer and this fits him her then it 's wonderful it 's warm soft and is made very well	12
1	finally ! ! ! i am a stickler for matching things with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but i love having the matching hat for my december baby i know she 's warm	12
1	it is still waiting for the baby to arrive so i have n't used it yet but i do love the utility and design of it	12
1	my son loves this mobile it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around	12
1	i had a hard time finding a play pen for my grand daughter there are many pack n play items but i wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago this one was exactly what i wanted she has room to roll around and play with toys and it 's easy to set up and take down	12
1	this product is great it is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it but i found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old	12
1	i have no idea how our parents had us with out these ! they are the best invention ! my son likes to play with plates so i can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating i have a toddler and a 9 mo old neither of them have been able to remove these things and beleive me they 've tried so i dont know what that other review was talking about they 're inexpensive easy to use and clean	12
1	i bought this monitor so i can hear what goes on in my sons room who is upstairs i have crystal clear reception and i also have another monitor in the house for another room and they never get interrupted it is extremly sensitive every breath is heard awesome monitor no problems yet so far ! ! !	12
1	i love this key and cell phone set so much i'm buying another one for a friend i looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall my 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone \( actually even my older kids think it 's pretty neat \) great product great price	12
1	we bought this for our son \( now two \) and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car it gives him something to play with and they are n't too noisy for long trips	12
1	my husband and i just had a wonderful baby girl \( apr 9 2007 \) and i simply could not live without this item my daughter loves sleeping in it it is light therefore it can be easily moved from one room to another as needed you could easily travel with it from hotels to the grandparents house it can be folded compactly and easily stored and there is also a handle for carrying the light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co sleep as well obviously do not leave your child unsupervised in it ! it is excellent and i highly recommend it to all parents	12
1	this is the single best new baby item that i purchased ! ! i was a mom who swore that my baby will never sleep in my bed needless to say that did n't last 3 nights i got this co sleeper and it was just perfect felt much more secure with him in there very portable too i took it everywhere for the first three months	12
1	this is great for keeping the sun out of my baby 's eyes from all angles and those on window shades always fall off and are annoying when you want to roll the window down this does the job just fine highly recommend it	12
1	my boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it it 's fun and it 's a miniature size adult potty they love it the seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already but we are making it work we have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger	12
1	she really enjoyed tummy time on this mat loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab	12
1	i love this gate one because of the height it is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble i also like that i can operate the gate with only one hand that is great because like other mom 's my hands are often busy with something else i would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate	12
1	i love these little books they play music good for before bed my girls can chew on them \( which makes both me and my two year old son happy \) just fantastic great buy	12
1	such a great product for my baby she loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time it builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together the plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands such a winne	12
1	i absolutely love this walker the songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained i also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere there are also great safety features such as the grip strips on the bottom the wheels are very easily manuevered also i would definitely recommend this product to other moms	12
1	we have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night they are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach i gave it 4 stars because it 's not extremely soft though it is n't bad i also like that the top layer is breathable gives me peace of mind	12
1	i was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub she loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills the only down side is that the crayons get a bit mushy after a bit of time in the water but it the baby einstein crayons are a good replacement which are inexpensive as well i look forward to many van gogh s from her	12
1	i am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath its getting him out that 's the problem with the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas personally i think these are some of the best tub toys ! my suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet you can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler it also makes a great place to color be careful to wash everything off before it dries	12
1	my two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world it 's so easy to get him to take a bath now ! the crayons are great and come off the tub easily i give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off the compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open thank you for making this !	12
1	but there are 2 things i do n't like one being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low my sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old second being that the continuous play songs do n't actually continually play it actually pauses for about 1 2 minutes my son will fall asleep to the music then it pauses and starts up again waking him i do love the vibration feature which is the main reason i bought it all in all it is worth it	12
1	my daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out then we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic amen ! i do n't care how many parts there are it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting	12
1	it 's perfect for people without a lot of extra room it 's very sturdy	12
1	the safety 1st cosco portable crib is great ! i purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits it 's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another i would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib it is very sturdy and also attractive	12
1	this crib has been a smash hit with our baby girl not too big yet roomy enough to spread out she loves sleeping in her crib and we like the size and convenience not sorry for the purchase ! carl	12
1	i am a new grandma the size and portability are a plus i was surprised that it came with a mattress i had n't read that in the description	12
1	it def is very sturdy does n't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too \) i'm very happy with this chair the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse my son has n't gotten food under there yet i ca n't wait to use it as a booster seat	12
1	this product definitely saves space but i 've had a hard time cleaning the tray yes it 's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that i end up hand washing it there are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that i'm always finding places that i misseed washing trust me the baby will manage to get food there too ! this product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing \( i 've seen this on some highchair models \)	12
1	i have yet to use this chair as i am a grandma awaiting the arrival of her first grandchild but from what i can see this high chair has everything a larger chair offers but in a lot less space ! it is very sturdy and well put together and i am already recommending it to friends	12
1	this chair is a great space saver attaches easily to the chair has two cup holders and the tray is the size of a normal high chair the draw back is it 's hard to adjust the seat for the infant was able to with some effort	12
1	my son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now i'm sure they will be perfect once he grows into them	12
1	being that we had our baby in december this was a godsend instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat my wife or i would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket works great	12
1	i bought this for my twin girls and i love it i had them in september and they fit it in all winter it was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle once you 're in the car and warm enough all you have to do is unzip the sides and there 's no fuss	12
1	absolutely love this product ! ! wish i had had one for my other 3 children we live in cold and windy north dakota and this is just so easy to use there have been times my little one has gotten too hot when i over bundle him in it i recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months	12
1	we got two bundlemes for our twin infant sons the product handles wears and washes well this product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates the only problem we have come across on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute	12
1	this is so much better than the bjorn carrier you can wear it on the hip or in front it is very comfortable my baby always felt secure and i never thought he would come out i could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem my back and shoulders were never sore easy to put on great way to calm a fussy baby ! reversible black for men too	12
1	after months of sleeplessness i received this pillow as a gift from my mom it is wonderful but not for the reasons i thought i thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins \( which it is \) but the real relief is that i barely wake up as i flip from one side to the other since it is nicely wedged between my knees	12
1	this is a great potty for boys we had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty in the potty easy to clean too	12
1	i spent quite some time online researching on a good reasonable potty and found this product it 's a bestseller and even better most of the buyers are very satisfied with it it 's functional sturdy easy to clean and seems comfy my son had some success with that one \)	12
1	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front i broke down and bought this this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty but it 's beauty is its simplicity he is able to sit and do his business carry the urine poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself \( he was not even 2 yet ! \) i would highly recommed the potty training book potty training in less than a day it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on	12
1	very cozy great for wrapping up after bath to get warm but honestly it 's usually in the laundry and since swaddling lasts for a short period of time it 's use is pretty limited however when it is clean i like having it around	12
1	i love this product all new mothers should include this on their registry how we 've lived without it for this long i 'll never know ! it is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now	12
1	the only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty otherwise they work really good tara boyc	12
1	this works great with our chicco capri stroller it took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close however once i figured that out it was great i could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed the swivel is a great concept i actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder \( one on each side \) and mommy could have her water bottle clip we just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles	12
1	seemed like a great system i came with two universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once if you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment it does not fit my aria twin stroller because the aria does not have any tubing anywhere available once you close it up \( and not much available once it 's open	12
1	great product ! it makes your life a lot easier not having to worry about boiling your bottles please keep in mind that it is a sterilizer not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer somehow a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does	12
1	this boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well we 've washed it in the washing machine several times and it 's very durable if you 're looking for a soft simple durable boppy slipcover i 'd highly recommend this one	12
1	i used this with my third child i washed it over and over and always the stains came right out it 's so soft ! ! ! ! definitely a good buy	12
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity yes activity at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving no moving no peek a boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby a good value at any price	12
1	the fabric is soft and cushion and what 's most important it provides good support for my baby she loves it	12
1	we got this before our little one was born she was born a little premature and only 4 lbs we used it in her bedside bassinet and later in her crib although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours baby girl is now two and we continue to use it she 's in a toddler bed now and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she 's not supposed to ! this is a great device and everyone should have one comparible in price to other nursery monitors you get so much more it also has clear sound and little interference in our house	12
1	the hello kitty chair was just adorable the quality and craftmanship is outstanding my 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking its just the right size thank yo	12
1	i shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach for my sons first visit i found this one and let me tell you it was perfect ! it was so easy to set up and take down and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds i saw a lot of other tents cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best both price and durability wise excellent find and buy	12
1	there are two types of dekor refill one regular and one 'plus' the sizes are different and you better be sure to order the right one	12
1	these bags work fine in the dekor diaper pail it would probably be easier if you could just buy trash bags from the store instead of special ordering them but i am borrowing this diaper pail so these are the bags that it uses they do work great keep the smell inside etc if you order be sure if you need regular or dekor plus diaper bags there is a difference in the size of the bags	12
1	diaper dekor is the small plus is the larger there are two sizes wo n't fit the smaller unit we have the smaller and our babies r us \( which is where we bought it \) says oh sorry we only carry the big ones now nice ! now we have to buy liners online i do n't mind buying online but i do n't appreciate that i ca n't go buy them where i bought the unit if i 'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we 'd have bought it 's excellent	12
1	when i purchased mine there was no diaper dekor which is the larger size however i feel that we have no need for a larger one my child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers no problem ! i bought the diaper genie because i was told so many things about it and i hate it it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them i am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the diaper dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes	12
1	this is the best potty seat that you can buy it 's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard also i love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall	12
1	my son loves this jumper it gives him a sense of independence he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around	12
1	i purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care it has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other the picture quality is great and the sound is amazing i can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house ! i would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children it will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along	12
1	we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews i would have to say that it does work well the only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor it has given me peace of mind that i do n't have to run in every sound she makes i can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me i would recommend this product	12
1	i am a disposable diaper mom however for night time or extra protection i throw the bummis wrap over the diaper and have never had a leak they wash up very nice and the velcro stays very strong it is by far the best wrap i 've used	12
1	when registering for baby needs i laughed at the idea of wipes warmer i thought what a waste ! after my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes i rethought this this product has been a life changer ! baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great easy to use the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out remember to purchase the pop up wipes however great product i would give as a gift	12
1	i was that parent who said i 'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer and then i woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who does n't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me i am now a big fan of the warmer it works very quickly and does n't dry them out and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up definately a nice product	12
1	i have not gotten to use this swing yet but i just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after i had it all put together i played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever \) i highly recommend	12
1	we got this when our baby was about 6 months old he is now 9 months at first he was n't sure what to do but once he figured out how to jump in it it was all he wanted to do the adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it it 's a little awkward to move around but the enjoyment well out weighs that	12
1	this jumper is worth it 's weight in gold my son is 3 1 2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so i decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion at first he was a little wobbly but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around i have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper i am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy	12
1	our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first but now that she 's 4 months old she loves this toy ! we recommend it !	12
1	great fun product my baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min couple times a day we own it from 2 months he was 4 months old he simply loves it he jumps and plays with the toys absolutely the best buy	12
1	these can definitely be a life saver during the first 1 2 weeks when you do n't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry i have small breasts so i could wear them in any bra and i did n't have a huge leakage problem so i changed the foam twice a day the only problem i had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it i think it got damp and was n't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after i stopped using them bottom line the relief was worth any minor inconvenience	12
1	i highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born if you plan on breastfeeding i was very sore in the first few weeks the shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings i did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks but they got me through those weeks when i do n't know if i 'd have made it otherwise ! they were a wonderful product for me	12
1	you will need this extra base ! ! i ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have the day after it arrived my mother in law was sick and could n't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up i had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened	12
1	we have 3 of them and have no complaints i keep one in my car one in my husbands and have another for travel it 's super easy to snap the carrier onto it and very easy to install in any car i just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars i could use the latch or just use the seatbelt for older cars i was worried that i would need my husband 's help with the installation but i was fine on my own just reading the directions i recommend this for everyone	12
1	i purchased this product for my hubby 's vehicle and we love not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time it works great highly recommended	12
1	i bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great ! now i do n't have to switch the whole seat when mom takes the baby i am very happy with this purchase	12
1	i reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers ! i had a generic diaper throw away system it was awful ! this is so easy to use once you get the hang of it and it really keps the smell away ! try it you'l like it	12
1	another great purchase received on time and in excellent condition ca n't say enough good things about the vendor and the shipping process it was painless and full of customer service a rarity these days	12
1	i had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before needless to say fabric does n't protect leather very well i ended up with deep depressions in the leather hopefully the leather will go back \( fingers crossed \) the firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up and both of the carseats are as secure as ever i have the rear and forward facing models	12
1	the car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months i have owned them they are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt i own a minivan so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan i would consider a different brand good luck ke	12
1	this seat works very well my son feels secure on it and it is easy to use highly recommended	12
1	even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning it fits perfecly evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it we needed this piece for our size opening we really had to squeeze it in but it is a great fit the gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye it took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism using 2 hands at first after some practice it was easy to use we liked it so much that we bought another	12
1	i need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room it 's used for an office and playroom and it 's the coldest room in the house so i like to keep the door open my daughter 's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell so i bought this one it took 7 minutes to install it 's not going anywhere and it 's very easy to open and close my dogs ca n't climb over it because the bars are vertical i love it am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8 year old daughter 's bedroom	12
1	we used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size he was sleeping through the night almost immediately part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled we used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free a def must have for every baby	12
1	my daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks she got very used to being swaddled but after 4 kids i still can not do it right this blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old when both the blankets were in the wash she would n't sleep that long she was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep	12
1	this product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home while others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes i found that i could keep it velcro 'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom my daughter really liked this but quickly outgrew it at just one month old she did n't want her arms tied down so the usefullness of the product is limited for a baby who loves being swaddled this is an indispensible item i 'll pass mine on with our hand me downs you never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled	12
1	i loved having this easy swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart the velcro worked really well as it gave room to grow swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two she just totally outgrew this it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift	12
1	we have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars this was the perfect solution because you can place the tie down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long so they will fit around large or small bars we had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with would n't reach but it was very easy to do i also like this product because it does n't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision	12
1	we were very pleased with how easy this was to install despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters ours is actually a half wall and half banister but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge the directions were n't great but it was fairly self explanatory we feel much more comfortable letting our one year old play upstairs in the loft now	12
1	this product has really worked well for me ! my daughter used to love pushing her barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below ! now we do n't have to worry about this anymore she ca n't reach her arm through these posts anymore either i use window cleaner to clean the smudge	12
1	i had checked out booster seats on the internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive it 's a bargain well made and easy to use my grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair the seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair when i wrote customer service about the problem they sent a whole new booster seat	12
1	excellent value for money our 8 month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we would n't have managed the holidays without it ! this seat is strong and stable yet easily assembled dis assembled it folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family we purchased this on 19 dec and it was delivered prior to christmas well done amazon	12
1	seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical ! my niece absolutely loved them she had such an easy time handling them because they are her size which is unusual all other instrument toys are so much larger and it 's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them ! the smiles and giggles are worth everything	12
1	my eight month old daughter really loves these instruments ! we bought them when she was about four months old but when she picked them up she 'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around i brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control now she really goes wild with them especially the bells !	12
1	my daughter plays with this toy at grandma 's house theses quot instruments quot are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with the bright colors and different noises definitely interest her she loves to shake them and make noise they are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you 're on the go	12
1	my daughter received these instruments as a gift last christmas and took to them right away she was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds we have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites just the right colors size and shape with just the right sounds ! she has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys they really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children	12
1	perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome for the price it has alot to offer it has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes it 's not the plushest stroller however for travel or quick errands it 's perfect for us	12
1	i gave this stroller as a gift so far there have been no problems	12
1	my daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and i love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds ! i love the rain ! even i fall asleep listening to it i had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter so i block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker \) i am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
1	i think this product is fantastic the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing the timer is also a nice feature this is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby the sheep is cute and surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it 's tummy	12
1	a good friend has this for her daughter i fell in love with it when i saw it completely adorable and works like a charm bought one as a baby gift as well but i 'd kinda like one myself	12
1	it 's very safe because of the non slip rubber our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes to the potty nice color too highly recommended ! !	12
1	the booster works great does not slip on a chair and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own i highly recommend this product	12
1	finally a cute pink car seat it is duralble and easy to lift around i wish they had this cute color for my other daughter ihave not deliverd yet so i do n't know how she will fit in it but i also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is there is not any other pink combo out there i just hope it works as well as it shows off	12
1	i am not wild about the colors and design but it 's not too bad the fabric is easy to clean \( machine washable \) and the sun canopy is great ! with an adapter i can easily snap it into my bugaboo stroller for ultimate convenience it 's just a great car seat although i wish there were cuter girly designs	12
1	the crib tent is great ! we originally got it to keep our cats out but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too \) until at 27 months he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper ! ! ! ! o so now we 're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week ! it is hard to change sheets with the crib tent but just get the ultimate crib sheet it 's a piece of cake ! \) also it is possible to put down the side rail of the crib but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head	12
1	this is such a versatile chair love the way you can fold it down compactly yet it 's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used the tray stores on the back legs when not in use nice touch for the reviewer who complained that the thing that separates the legs is attached to the tray you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray plus it 's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up my 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime	12
1	book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice the only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature i like this line of books better the the bright starts and baby einstein books	12
1	surprisingly its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food this one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage it is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too	12
1	i think everyone should one of these especially for when their kids are young my 8mo old tries to eat everything i do n't want him chewing on the handlebars of grocery cars \( yuck ! \) and it makes it much cleaner when you put him in a highchair at restaurants \( which are sometimes disgusting \) the best part it fits over extra large shopping carts at club stores like unlike other types	12
1	the floppy seat is a great item no more worrying about baby 's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs i recommend this to all new moms and give it an a	12
1	i am very happy with this potty it has a high guard which works well for a little boy	12
1	my son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this but my impression is that it is very simple to clean up \( which i love the idea of \) it seems comfy he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes	12
1	kissaluvs are the best ! they keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable baby 's skin does n't get red like it does with disposable diapers also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops	12
1	this seat along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well	12
1	this stool is great right size for young child to seat on the potty it is narrow and does n't take up a lot of room plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty	12
1	i have a 10 month old baby and i have tried every bottle i used the avent with my 1st baby these bottles are the best ! why \? because they do not leak no bubbles and the design is fabulous once the baby holds it her himself the angles top is great for little or no air in baby's tummy the little rubber seal disk you put in the bottom is a cinch ! do n't wast time or money on any other bottle	12
1	these are really good bottles i have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son my only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns the flow is much too slow my little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried so if you plan on using these bottles i would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby i am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples other than that these bottles are great	12
1	the pacified pod isn 's essential but it 's definitely good to have you can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom 's bag or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk and with all the cute patterns you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag	12
1	medela products are all great these containers came sterile and are so convenient to store pumped milk one can add the medela nipple and feed the baby directly from the container very useful ! highly recommended	12
1	this item works for me perfect i had ordered two of them but found one did so well i have returned the second one there was nothing wrong with it i just had no need for it for the record i am not using this for a child it is used to restrain the movements of a pet it works perfect for that so i am sure it would do wonders for a child	12
1	my house was built in 1862 and i have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized crooked doorways this gate \( when hardware mounted \) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could i agree that it 's not easy to use you have to readjust the size each time it 's opened or closed but for me it 's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways also the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it super easy to install i'm very happy with this gate	12
1	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby i'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold very good quality product	12
1	i love this potty chair ! ! it is so simple and that is what i like about it simple to use simple to clean my little boy loves it	12
1	these are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night they wash up nicely and seem as good as the day i bought them my only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro they stick to other things in the wash i think this puts extra wear on the velcro too	12
1	item is exactly as pictured described cute design and good quality adds a nice touch highly recommend	12
1	we are using this bather for our son who is one month old what we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby the fabric is also very soft quick drying and removable for machine washing the model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby 's waist to keep him warm we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath since we do n't fill up the tub with water slippage has not been a problem	12
1	i like this product very much it is very soft unlike the other tubs where i was scared that my son would hit his head the only drawback i have about is the belt maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant other than that i would recommend it to anyone it looks very comfortable too especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system	12
1	we bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly this one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again i also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean	12
1	this pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited i even use it at home when just watching television it creates a natural relaxing position it is a must have	12
1	this pillow works ! sleeping in the car used to make my son crankybecausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss cry now with this comfy pillow he naps peacefully wakes up happy	12
1	i really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good the only thing i don acute t like is the way the strings work there are not enough and also they rip off easily not stitched well for the price generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed also suffication could be a problem we have bought a convertable crib \( common in europe \) which can be used till approx age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later anyhow we still love it it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari	12
1	while not as portable as i assumed it would be it 's been a great space saver over a std highchair and great to have	12
1	this chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son 's only high chair i love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair however i bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything i thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair if you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you do n't have a climber this is the chair for you but if you have an escape artist this chair is no better than typical high chairs	12
1	i bought this chair second hand for my six month old son and he loves it \( whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs \) it 's a great size easy to use good color for hiding stains and comfortable for him to sit in best of all because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag we can be sure that he does n't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat ! this is an excellent product and well worth the money	12
1	i loved this ! he was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space it folds up smaller than a pack and play takes up very little room next to the bed and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos \( or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby	12
1	this bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed it feels so good knowing he 's so close its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps oh yeah and its really cute	12
1	i bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all i love the color the material is easy to wash and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable i have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly my only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months the bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving other than that what you see is what you get ! worth every penny ! ! !	12
1	we have n't used this set yet because our baby is due in june but have set it up in our crib the fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking the bumper fits well in our crib and the tags say all the fabrics are 100 cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100 polyester we are very happy with this set for our future little girl	12
1	this is the best carseat out there it 's above the peg perego and britax it weighs only 8 pounds so it does n't break your arm and it is so easy to adjust the best feature is the base is designed so that it does not move in the car i 've had graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when i made turns because they just were n't secure even with the special belt clip the only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it 's job 5 stars ! ! !	12
1	they 're a little pricey but they work great they are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make	12
1	these bibs are the best my son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out when meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch must have for any new parent	12
1	these are the best bibs i have tried many they do not peel crack etc i have used the same set of bibs for 2 years i just bought a set for my sister worth the money	12
1	this cup holder works great i attached it to a pull cart that i needed at work to put books etc in after i had foot surgery it also works on walkers	12
1	this is my favorite sheet for our daughter 's crib it is a soft knit material and it washes up so well it fits easily onto the matress and i have never had a problem with it coming loose it is also such an adorable print	12
1	i too was given this pump by a lactation nurse i pump at night after my baby goes to sleep i think the pump is great ! it does what i need it to do and it very comfortable the only drawback is that is is kind of loud i would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally	12
1	i bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield i had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and i was n't able to get a drop out because the shields did n't stay in place if you have biggre breasts i would suggest using this pump	12
1	the only bottles my daughter would take were the playtex original nursers i am pumping at work with a medela pump in style so i was pumping into the medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the playtex drop ins to feed her it was a hassle and i never felt like all of the milk especially the fat made it from the medela bottles into the drop ins and then i heard about this kit and bought two immediately i have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the drop ins the only downside you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump	12
1	this seems to be a secure seat and our almost 5 year old is comfortable in it the buckling system is a bit inconvenient you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped i wish our son could buckle himself in at this point but this seat makes it too hard it 's also not a seat you want to do air travel with as it 's unwieldy to carry around but all in all i would say it 's a good purchase	12
1	the crib arrived much sooner than i was quoted i was told 3 weeks it came in 4 days very prompt it is a beautiful crib i love it the directions are a bit lax it took my husband and i two hours to put it together mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer and not the rest of the crib ! we finally figured it out other than that the crib is beautiful	12
1	these are the greatest invention in bottles ever these bottles helped my daughter so much no more gas no spills or leaks the only downside is they are hard to clean but who cares	12
1	this monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night i test it frequently and it works there has never been a false alarm \( everyone warned me i would lose my mind if it went off by accident it has n't \) the only drawback the channel is not so clear there is static when you listen to it but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny \( i have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when i just want to monitor noise during the day but i would not have another monitor for his bedroom	12
1	i love this sack and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !	12
1	this is the perfect mattress for my little princess it 's nice and cushy while providing the necessary firmness the vinyl cover is easy to wipe off if there are accidents it 's also lightweight for easy sheet changings sealy provides a solid trusted product not necessary to spend a lot of money on a mattress your child will use for 2 4 years my baby sleeps comfortably on it every night and she 's tough to please ! so i would definitely recommend this product to other parents	12
1	the chest looks as in the picture and that is what i liked though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this my husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time although it took him 5 hours to put together he got through it fine instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room	12
1	this backless booster is a simple last step booster bottom for kids who are ready to buckle themselves and like to change where they sit and are old big enough to know their part the booster is light but well made its use is super easy but the one piece arms help giude the passive restraint seat belts the fun color was a good bonus	12
1	it 's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier this product solves that problem ! and it 's cute too i was shopping at babys 'r' us recently and the sales girl asked where i got my super cute diaper bag carrier i told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item \( no word yet on whether or not they will \) i have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts it 's the ultimate in convenience and fashion	12
1	we 've used this since our baby was born three months ago it has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own it has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear \( as well as inside compartments \) it also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use the bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but i have seen it used on older children we 'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting	12
1	my son is 5 months old and loves this jumper ! ! ! he can keep himself entertained and i am able to do some things with both hands ! plus it 's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down laughing ! i love the tray around it it 's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way also the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out we are going on vacation in a month and this will be making the trip !	12
1	this bag is great for a short trip it has enough space for a few pampers up to 2 bottles it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space im a pro with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me !	12
1	i originally bought this bag for a trip to disney world it held everything great stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack although i was not using it to carry children 's gear i carried an umbrella 3 bottles of water granola bars sun glasses cellphone keys wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great ! i am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far	12
1	this is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks i had more leaks with disposables we are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes i am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth and delighted with the ease of use of this product	12
1	it is a little costy but worth the money it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover its size is large enough to last many years	12
1	this was a gift and in shopping for a pack n play it seemed the best value for the price	12
1	baby is happy eating well what better praise for a bottle nipple can be given \? note fast flow is for age six months and up the slow medium flow nipples by avent are just as good \( just for younger babies	12
1	my son was a very fussy bottle eater he would never finish his bottle until i switched to a faster flow nipple now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater he became frustrated that the milk was n't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect he is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding	12
1	they 're a little pricey but they work great they are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make	12
1	our grandson reciently came to live with us nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty the day our 1st pott arrived i opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help about 15 minutes later i noticed drake had been very quiet as i searched the house for him i discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! he is now doing very well with his training ! the product is well constructed easy to to set up and easy to use	12
1	i love this chair we have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well i have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves	12
1	we love this seat it is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs or at mother inlaws without a highchair or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair when traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event there are so many uses for this great little seat it is extremely light weight and compact and comes with a carrying bag	12
1	we used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month old son to mexico we always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage he was attached to our rolling carry on curbside and off we went we were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry at 20 you ca n't beat the price our friends had to carry their car seat stroller luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap	12
1	i found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two year old easier she loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked the security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x ray machine	12
1	the item is so much cheaper than the alternative which is 200 it was easy to use and easy to store when not in use	12
1	the sizes are perfect especially the small one for my 5 month old the suction works fine so far but we will see as baby gets older	12
1	my grand daughter is so proud of her big girl potty seat i would have given it a rating of 5 but she said the rim hurts her	12
1	finally found this item ! i could n't find this anywhere locally it is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean	12
1	i am impressed with this seat ! this seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet the training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes pottyprincess pottypirate pottypony and pottysaurus i called the free line \( 87 pottypal \) and was able to buy the stool \( a little cheaper than amazon 's set \) and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards i am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product	12
1	my daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it \( at 8 months \) it was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first i took one star off due to some minor problems 1 \) it is not machine washable \( unless you do n't mind loosing the barking sound \) and 2 \) the battery ca n't be replaced	12
1	my twins loved this one so much we purchased all styles available at the time	12
1	we like this car seat for the price we paid likes love the easily adjustable belts we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately the 5 point harness is great love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers dislikes it does n't recline as much as we 'd like and the head padding is superficial our baby 's head tends to fall forward a lot the sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought it certainly works more than adequately but does n't move easily finally the handle is difficult to move from position to position overall though for the price it 's a good seat	12
1	i have always had graco infant seats for my children i got this one for baby number 4 and love it it is so cute ! and the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months also i love the color of it	12
1	my daughter received this as a gift from mommy when she was about 3 1 2 months at first she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face but if you take off a ring take it higher your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy the only complaint i have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child the mirror distorts your child 's vision so i took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it ! my daughter loves it she could be eating her breakfast or sitting in her swing and all she 'll do is stare at her playmat ! a definite must for all parents	12
1	this seat is wonderful my daughter ca n't quite sit on her own yet but this keeps her secure and comfortable make sure you loop the belt around your child and the cart or high chair this seat is small and very easy to use it 's a great product	12
1	i am quite satisfied with this product overall sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence during armer weaather when the window was opened i also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product	12
1	when our first child was born my wife purchased the lower model from medela with the second child and her having to go back to work sooner we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied she uses it everyday when she is at work the price might be higher than others but think about all of the money you will save on formul	12
1	the pisa is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula so my pump has already paid for itself \( used for 6 months and still going strong \) ! i 've tried generic immitations and they just do n't compare invest your money in the real thing it 's worth it	12
1	i was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles most of the potties i looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and i didn`t want anything like that this potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings just what the doctor prescribed	12
1	this potty is just right for our little boy he seemed comfortable from the first time we placed him on it his little feet touch the ground and the shape notonly supports him but also protects for little boy mishaps and gives him something to hold on to while bearing down i would definitely recommend this especially if you are starting early !	12
1	i cannot say enough positive things about this item ! i absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night this item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids	12
1	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
1	like any parent i was concerned about sids so the sleepsack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets little did i know i would come to love the sleepsack for it 's warming capabilities after a few months under their belt babies get very squirmy in the middle of the night so blankets are useless \( and dangerous \) so i relied heavily on the sleepsacks to keep my little guy warm even after the risk of sids passed they come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months and they 're generous in size so they are not outgrown easily i only wish i 'd purchased them in yellow or white in case my next baby is the opposite sex	12
1	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
1	my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo this set is adorable and practical he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl th eonly thing to be ware of is it gets very hot in the microwave even if you just put it in for 20 seconds it must cool dow	12
1	i do n't know what the reviewers before me were talking about i use this at kroger giant eagle and target and do n't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store it 's sturdy and easy to use do n't pass this one up	12
1	good things \( 1 \) no interference we live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs \( 2 \) connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement i 've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems \( 3 \) you can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery only one bad thing the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless they are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband	12
1	we struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco the first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless i ca n't explain how delighted my wife and i were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby it was better than christmas morning when we were kids ! ! ! we have wireless internet cell phones cordless phones basically if its electronic we got it despite all the potential for interfence the graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference a must buy for any parent	12
1	the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful animal images are unusually cute i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up	12
1	this item was very cute the different textures \( just like the bedding set \) are a lot of fun i hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them my only complaint is the ribbon loops they 've sewn on to hang them mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven you can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though	12
1	these wall hangings are lovely the different textures are very cool maybe mine were different than everyone elses but they came with little ribbon loops on the back and i do n't get why there 's an issue hanging them they 're very very cute and look adorable in the room	12
1	love it love it love it ! no more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty lint covered binkies it could be a little bigger for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it 's a great idea	12
1	i bought this as a gift ca n't give much opinion she told me she loved them so i give it 5 stars maybe that 's not a fair review but it 's breast pads they are always useful ! lo	12
1	i bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind which i love come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often you really are supposed to do that because otherwise you will get an breast infection especially if you live in the south where it 's warm and humid i recommend the ultra thin pads the other ones that come in the variety pack are just ok	12
1	when i had my daughter i had no clue where to begin with breast pads so i bought several different types a friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite i wish i had never wasted money on the other pads i did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands it was worth it because they were so much more comfortable i did n't have any chaffing like with most others also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive	12
1	these are the best pads for the task the ultra thin pads are great for during the day they dont leak and are very breathable the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar try every kind you get samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best	12
1	it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks i have searched the web and ca n't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing does n't look quite as good with a brush that does n't match	12
1	bought 2 different monitors this one has great features such as the motion sensor auto and scan settings the night vision is weak but daytime looks great better reception than the other video monitor i bought but not having good night vision is a drawback i really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom none of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear it is the best one that i 've found on the market	12
1	if you are flying alone with a small child you should not go without this it 's a tight fit but it works	12
1	any easy to use lightweight booster carseat highest scores from consumer reports made it our first choice	12
1	our second one \( for a second child \) we use one with a back one without easy to use comfortable solid a good choice for a booster seat at a good price	12
1	we like this stroller it seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability \( shoulder strap \) make it ideal for trips especially in airports my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall \( 6'4 \) but it is fine for me \( 5'3 \) we like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice overall a good stroller for the price	12
1	i absolutely love these paci keepers and highly recommend them they are the only ones that my son does n't manage to rip off of himself i got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear facing car seat that made for a horrible trip i purchased these and they are awesome !	12
1	put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo	12
1	the best bib around ! wash and dry and large enough to catch everything i will never again use another bib	12
1	have used these bibs for two kids now wow do they last and unlike some bibs these can go right in the washer and dryer well worth the money ! still using them for my messy 3 year old	12
1	the car seat itself is awesome but the condition it arrived in was awful the box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind there was nothing covering the seat \( like a plastic bag \) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat it was a gift for my grandson for christmas so i did n't have time to return it and hope for a timely return it took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me	12
1	this stroller holds up to 55 lbs unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs i love the raised handle bars they cause less strain on your shoulders and back there is a roomy basket under the seat which is a great bonus the 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass once my son was able to sit up on his own i have used an umbrella stroller exclusively this is hands down the best one i have ever had it is also very modern looking in black and gray	12
1	the base seems to be high quality it is sturdy and easy to install it is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat other than being pricey there is no complaints	12
1	when we first got the stroller it pulled to the left significantly but we got on the phone with tike tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating the stoller works great now i have taken it running with my two girls it is very stable and drives smoothly	12
1	i am sure this is a good stroller \( that 's why i bought it ! \) my review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive do n't be fooled usually ships within 24 hours really means may ship sometime as of 2 8 06 our stroller has not arrived it was ordered january 1 2006 it is not even slated to ship for another week \( we 'll see \) meanwhile the local store has several in stock my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time	12
1	this is the greatest product they stick to every restaurant table i have ever secured them to are lightweight easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at every time i pull one out of the diaper bag she says elmo elmo elmo they keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple i would n't do without them they are great	12
1	table toppers are an awesome product we do n't leave the house without them it gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the table topper we just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing the different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food other people not only parents ask about the table toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product	12
1	if you have an ipod or mp3 player i 'd recommend getting this i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week and tested it out \( our baby has n't been born yet \) the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo and i'm 1 2 deaf i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color my only criticism is that it takes batteries \( no ac adapter \) we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly for 20 i think it 's great	12
1	this crib is well built and functional the drawer is a nice and convenient feature the finish is good for an inexpensive crib assembly was easy with good instructions included we plan on using this crib for our next baby as well	12
1	i got this for my baby due in march even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy its perfect wieght for the 50 75 degree weather it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby it washes well too ! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you do n't need it then the top part zips off and you do n't have to take baby out and remove the entire product then the next chilly day zip the top back on ! great all around	12
1	this is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it i am very pleased with the purchas	12
1	this baby gate is ideal for the size and price i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate the hardware mount eye hooks are not the sturdiest but this gate definately gets the job done	12
1	when it comes to using this for your children you 'd have to first know what your needs are i ca n't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing it would be more like a psychological barrier but depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they should n't have i ordered this to use for my puppy in my case i do n't have the problem of her pushing on it so i ca n't say how long it would last through that for this price i was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install	12
1	use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening one minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile all and all it is a very good product	12
1	this jogger is great i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo	12
1	this a wonderful stroller i have a large 35lb 2yr old and he is very comfortable great folding mechanism folding is easy and i can do it with one hand nice pockets for storage	12
1	was a snap to put together very soft for baby moves with ease takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller but that 's the only problem	12
1	i had to return to work after my second daughter was born and had no place to pump i bought this and pumped in my car for several months great	12
1	it does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car my wife used it on a cross country trip we took and it basically saved our lives well not our lives but it does work	12
1	this is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump the long cord was helpful too so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete it was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car but i 'm hoping that it gets easier the more i use it	12
1	this is excellent ! i pump in my car while at work and this is the best idea ever nice long cord allows you to pump in the backseat for privacy a must have	12
1	this bin is great for cloth diapers we love ours keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two 's worth of diapers which is all i need because we wash every other day our local babies r us sells replacement deodisks \( or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors \) when the one that comes with it loses it 's smell so that you can maintain freshness it 's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	12
1	baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles quick cleanup quick fill up love the nipple variety too because of the liners it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces etc would highly recommend	12
1	tip ! ! ! you can push a 4 oz baby juice bottle that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery up into the playtex nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners this will prevent punctures from your fingernails be sure to remove the juice bottle before feeding baby	12
1	the original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave my baby would n't take the bottle until i introduced the brown rubber nipple thanks mom	12
1	this is an excellent product it is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about sids i felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib and that she would n't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats i was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material we even had family members that thought that someone had made the cribshield for us	12
1	i got this system for my 18 mo old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was stuck they have helped prevent him from doing that any more however if he 's in the mood he can easily dismantle the entire contraption so it wo n't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to in fact the two end panels had to be removed because he would n't leave them alone all in all though i think the mesh bumpers do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys \( and pluggers \) in the crib instead of out on the floor	12
1	i have been very impressed with every avent product that i have purchased i have found these pacifiers to be so nice they are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them my baby loves hers we ca n't live without them	12
1	we used the small size until our daughter was too long for it \( around 3 months old \) and switched to the large size she still loves it and is sleeping great \( 3 day naps and 10 11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night \) ! it is part of her naptime bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are the velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated	12
1	the medela breast pump works with dr brown 's bottles \( you can pump directly into the bottle \) ! just an added benefit to an already great product i 've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had no problems it 's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding pumping for more than a couple of months	12
1	to bring the co sleeper up to the height of the bed these leg extensions are the best bet yes as someone else said they do make it a little shaky so if you are not planning to attach the co sleeper to your bed you may want to leave the height alone \( you 'll be getting up anyway so it probably does n't matter how tall it is \) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap rather than free standing it was very secure	12
1	i love this car seat stroller it goes from car to airplane in no time flat great if you travel with small children with just one adult also great if running errands and your child falls asleep no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car however the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it i still love this product	12
1	i love it ! this is probably one of my most used baby items it is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean i 've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends	12
1	this product was very easy to use quick clean up and very discrete to carry in public my husband and i are constantly using it when we are out with our child i especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage	12
1	i use it while my daughter is lying down she loves being in the tub this just makes her float it 's great as the get bigger to use like the ring would buy for a friend and totally recommend !	12
1	i feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking it is perfect for my girl i do understand why people with boys may have issues but if you have a girl it is just wonderful i have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better it has a great weight to it so it 's not flimsy and it fits my girls bum so nicely and the cushion is very firm yet soft the handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool sit and pull herself back my friend has the pricey bjorn and while that is nice i saved 15 on something that works just as well	12
1	i have a home daycare so this chair is used constantly i 've had two of these for well over a year and today i bought a third one i 've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far nothing beats the swinging tray i would recommend it to anyone	12
1	we 've used this seat when traveling and everyday use at home when our son was about 15 months old i put the highchair away and started using this it can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser ! ! it folds down so it can be put away easily if you 're having guests unlike a big highchair ! great chair !	12
1	good baby monitor overall sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and i ca n't find where the interference is coming from	12
1	we really like our graco digital imonitor it gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously we do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box usually it reaches about 1 2 a city block depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries the lights that light up for baby 's sound are quite bright which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness i turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake	12
1	my husband is a nyc doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son 's room in this theme since my hubby deals with taxi 's and limo 's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it we also love manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in l i the set is very well made and i like the fact that since it feels like it will last my son can grown with it it is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre school years	12
1	if you are going to get a manual pump get this one i got a medela from the hospital and it was sooo slow and killed my hand but this one is way better it takes 5 10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the medela and it does n't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals and because you use it for less time total i have never used an electric pump so i ca n't compare it to one of those but as far as manuals go this one is awesome	12
1	i have had great success with this manual pump my best advice if you are having trouble is to take out the petals ! ! ! this helped me immensely milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my i was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening i took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective i used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me i highly recommend this pump	12
1	great product i heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get i agree	12
1	this is a durable and quality product my son uses it for everything from turning the lights on to getting on the potty i use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that i must hide from my 2 and a half year old i must say that i am a hard core fan on baby bjorn items as they are durable classic in design and color this is a sturdy non slip item it has supported me for months 120lbs \( give or take 10 lbs ! \) we used it so much that i bought another step stool made by playskool and i wished i had bought another babybjorn	12
1	having only used it once as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat it worked wonderful having a clean place to put her food on was nice as you never know just how clean the tables really are	12
1	i love that it sticks and does n't slide it is great for my 21 month old to feel part of the family when we eat	12
1	this is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters i ca n't believe we did n't buy it sooner it 's easy to clean and does n't slide off the chair our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy it even has a little carrying bag to take on trips great vendor with quick delivery too	12
1	i'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat it 's easy to install and works great	12
1	my daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and i was always worried that she would get cold especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter i saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now and i know she stays warm throughout the night the only suggestion i have for anyone thinking of buying this is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one mine is growing so fast that i will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long	12
1	i bought these extensions because i had to have them so that the co sleeper would fit properly next to my bed however when added the sleeper did n't seem as steady or stable on the floor there was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them while not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed i expected something a little more solid or sturdy	12
1	i used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place it works great ! her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better which is a plus	12
1	this doll is attractive does everything it is supposed to do comes with appropriate accessories and above all children love it appears to be well made with a soft cuddly body and our 6 year old granddaughter loves it	12
1	we got this for our cruise and it worked great it was very easy to carry and load onto the train bus and car when it was needed the material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty	12
1	this is such a great idea i just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib we can make our own	12
1	we are in italy with these huge weird shaped stairways these gates are great and just what we were looking for easy to install easy to use once up they look nice in our house	12
1	i also own the bundle me w fluffy heavy winter liner we could not have lived without it ! i was excited to see this trendy light weight weather resistant version for spring i 'll admit i would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at 39 99 my 59 99 dismay soon evaporated it is so sleek and functional ! no more struggling with bulky snowsuits jackets and sweaters \( which never seem to fit baby anyway \) easily unzips so as not to overheat love the little pocket for binky velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller \( no need to buy two ! \)	12
1	i just received my travel set today and i already love it ! the bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle i have the pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house i highly recommend it	12
1	this is the bmw of all highchairs it 's super sturdy and the italian leather seat is easy to care for ignore the reviews about being a pain to clean you need to clean every highchair nooks crannies and all	12
1	it was nice of my ninth month wife to agree upon a diaper bag that i was n't too embarrassed to carry now that the baby 's here i 've found it to be functional as well as comfortable it easily holds enough clothes diapers and stuff and does n't feel like you 're carrying an elephant no complaints at all it 's a great bag	12
1	unfortunately the baby i bought this for already had one ! but i got to see it in action and listen to the parents rave about it ! it is really neat almsot to the point i wish i had kept it for myself ! !	12
1	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly and i do not miss that i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry it has always worked well and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately the picture is clear the sound is excellent you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in but the cords are all generous in length we would go nuts without it	12
1	i just got this item for my two story house i was able to see the crib from the upstairs nursery throughout my house and even outside the monitor is not in color so that is misleading but the picture looks grea	12
1	it works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it ! ! sometimes there is a little interference but if you just move the monitor \( sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference \) it will work great ! we have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again ! ! the night vision works great even in our son 's dark room the color is great as long as there is sufficient light	12
1	this item is worth more than the cost it is a most have at home with a new born baby expecially 1st time parent like me i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house worth more than trhe cos	12
1	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool it has rechargeable batteries image and sound are clear enough night vision works perfect monitor is not bulky at all \( no color at all though \) and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us	12
1	i purchased the sesame beginnings walker and my daughter loves it there is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself it also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them this walker makes noise and lights up there is n't any paint on her walker and i do n't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter	12
1	this mat works great kids ca n't throw it on the floor it catches food i love it ! !	12
1	i bought this for my second son who is a year old i love it it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag after he eats i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well \( and saves my floors ! \) i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !	12
1	i was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews but once i put the organizer up it was great i use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items the bottom is really good for several diapers i love it ! ! !	12
1	i love the baby bjorn bib it is excellent for protecting my 1 year old son 's clothes as he learns to feed himself it is great for car rides too i can place cheerios in the pocket and he can feed himself a little snack the only drawback is that with my son being small the highchair tray and the pocket are the same height however as he grows taller they wo n't interfere with each other	12
1	i received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver how nice that i can monitor my baby 's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute ! the are two different channels so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off sometiems it 's also just a matter or re positioning the monitor to resolve the noise we were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls but switching to channel b solved that i 've used the evenflo whisper connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied	12
1	i have this monitor now and i'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati	12
1	as most of the other reviewers i live in a small townhome this chair is wonderful it takes up very little space and is so easy to clean i remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean the rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher despite carrots prunes etc being mashed into it the tray has n't stained at all i recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends	12
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone we just love it and so does our 6 month old	12
1	i received this stroller about a week ago and so far we love it the ride is smooth it 's very light and i love the salmon color the shade comes in handy too it has all the features i 'd want while still remaining ight and streamlined it 's a little awkward to close but i'm a bit of a klutz so i assume others might not have this problem the handles are great though and they 're very comfortable for my husband \( 6 feet \) and me \( 5'7 \)	12
1	lightweight high quality construction we are very pleased with it and our 1 5yr girl just loves it the carrying strap is a very convenient addition do n't waste your money on a 20 umbrella stroller spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller	12
1	i was looking for a decent sized sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect i have not used them to travel with but i do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting they do work great for her leftovers though when i put them in the fridge they are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas	12
1	these stickers are great my toddler has a small white table that about every 3 months we decorate with new stuff this quarter its cars he loves them they are very durable vibrant and colorful highly recommended	12
1	my granddaughter is one year old she absolutly loves her new walker she is small for her age so the adjustable height is perfect	12
1	i brought this walker for my grandson and he loves it he alway 's playing with the objects and is actually walking now this wallker was easy to assemble also	12
1	i had my doubts when we first used it b c it closes with just some toggle like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through but my baby comes out of this stroller sleeping bag wrap warm every time and we 've had a few days this winter here in the northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face	12
1	this is one interesting toy ! i love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water ! you can even create music for it which is something i 've never thought would be possible kids today have it made !	12
1	if they made one of these things for adults i 'd get one ! ! my daughter loves this thing it 's got that crinkle sounding paper that babies seem to love and spins really easily the colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands i have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these	12
1	this seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean i am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads it 's almost porous ! if you get this changing pad plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean	12
1	it works great for me i have 2 floor 2 kids 2 cats and before i did n't know what going on in my house now i can hear any sound guests coming kids playing watching tv and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food it makes some fone sound on max volume but i do n't care i just reduse volume or change unit position i strongly recomend this monitor	12
1	we were downstairs one night watching tv and kept hearing crickets turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor this thing is so good i can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up there is no doubt i can hear anything my daughter needs i can tell from her cry through the monitor whether i need to prep or bottle get a diaper ready or its time for play	12
1	every mother father should definitely purchase a baby monitor until this came i could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not the receiver side is battery operated so even if i walk around the house i can here my baby even the smallest sound is picked up ! amazing i have n't tried other monitors but this one is perfect and inexpensive so i would recommend it to anyone	12
1	it took no time to figure out how to use this seat my daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements so i am moving here from a 5 point harness britax to this booster in a second car the seat is easy to install and remove and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding i can definately see using it for travel on planes as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry my daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water they are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat highly recommended	12
1	its definitely a practical way to carry the essentials for a baby or a kid or whatever	12
1	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
1	we 've had this toy for around 3 years now my second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn ! it is also a hit with other children visiting our house the toy is as educational as it is fun ! we 've used it to practice colors shapes and musical creativity it can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run 20 new all in all a fantastic toy well worth the price ! another upside is how friendly and helpful the neurosmith company is we lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement my friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much	12
1	this 2 in 1 is amazing the scent is wonderful too bad they do n't make it for adults \) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products try them and you 'll see why	12
1	great sleepsack for our little bundle keeps her warm toasty i love the microfibre interior because it 's warm but not too hot also the exterior is wind resistant so it 's perfect for san francisco	12
1	this is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids this is a pretty boring product but everything worked just fine	12
1	as im sure all mothers can relate my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart i looked at a lot of local stores for a cover i couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt 80 this one is great ! its reasonably priced wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts ! !	12
1	my two and half year old kept telling me he wanted to stand up to go to the potty like his older brother and daddy a friend recomended this product and when my little one saw it he was so excited he loves the fact that he can flush it all by himself	12
1	no more worries about being too short and missing the bowl yea ! ! !	12
1	i bought this sheet for my graco pack n' play and it fits great it 's very soft and looks great wash after wash	12
1	i had one of these with my second son and loved it we just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary when it was hot out we could uncover him and when we went into somewhere with air conditioning we would just cover him up it is soft and cozy we found it so convenient we will be purchasing another one for number three who 's due in may	12
1	this lamp is so much cuter than i was expecting the quality looks excellent i looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for the quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others	12
1	this is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there the colors are fabulous the material is soft and nice and i was so pleased by its overall quality we also purchased some of the extras \( the lamp pillow and wall hangings \) and were just as pleased i would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that does n't wish to know the gender before it 's born but also any parent that does know be assured it is great for a girl or boy especially if you like animals ! !	12
1	i did my research for the best stroller thus this one is the best in market travelling with my baby is much fun and easier i can carry fold and move it with no help its so easy to open and fold its very cozy my baby can sleep happily in it	12
1	my boys love them they draw in the car and their cup can sit on it kinda a pain for short drives but wonderful for longer trips	12
1	i bought 3 packages of dr brown 's \( through amazon com \) standard size nipples and i received 2 standard and 1 wide they shipped the wrong item to me i returned the wide to the address in calabasas california and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to right start i enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him since my purchase i still have not received anything except this email from amazon com i rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star	12
1	i bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers with the touch of one button i can keep track of how long it has been since i fed my baby i do n't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone the first unit i was sent was defective and i received terrific customer service when i contacted the company i am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because i 'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well maybe a future model	12
1	we had an old wooden cradle for the newborn the snuggle nest made it snuggly warm and comfy however it did n't work in our bed \( queen size \) because it was big and bulky if you plan on using it in your bed buy inclined to sleep with positioners babies'r'us sells it now it 's easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep	12
1	i am nursing our 2 wk old and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us my husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby so he does not sleep well the snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep also the dvd has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help i only wish we would have bought this with second child	12
1	this product saves time and for people that hygiene freak this is a good one wash yor baby bottle dry them and sterilise as needed also i take to work to sterilise my pump and bottle before pumping with the parts since it is just few minutes	12
1	the fastest way to know your plastic baby wares are clean ! i love these bags note i use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping you do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item before steaming it for best results overall i would highly recommend this product it has been a lifesaver to me	12
1	i only occasionally feed my baby and my apartment does n't have a dishwasher i usually decide right before going out that i want to take a bottle so this disinfects everything really quick in 3 minutes as opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes and i do n't use it every days so i do n't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz i would have to sterilize it again right before using	12
1	i heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges not a big deal i just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished	12
1	i love this bottle dryer it was a little pricey but worth it ! it holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop i never put bottles binkies etc away anymore i just leave them because it is so convienent	12
1	just what i wanted ! a portable waterproof durable padded easy to clean changing pad	12
1	i love this containers first of all i am a big fan of the isis breast pump so these containers are perfect for me i express into these containers freeze them thaw them out replace the sealing disc with the nipple warm it up then my husband is ready to feed the baby it 's one of their times together and i get to spend time with my older children perfect	12
1	i use the medela pump but their thin bottles and simple caps do n't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh i love the heavy advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle	12
1	my newborn loves this seat the calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy ! easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you great product !	12
1	i tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing even the playtex nursers which i liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son i had received a free avent nurser so i tried it and the problem was eliminated i bought the newborn set and some extras not cheap but worth it for a content baby ! i was quite upset when they began leaking then i discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you do n't tighten as much as possible if you tighten avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn they do n't leak ! no gas no leaks happy baby	12
1	i wanted this set since i saw it in babies r us but it was so much more expensive this is perfect for my new baby girl i always loved hello kitty and i hope she will too also there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set the lamp rug and mobile are a must ! \) the set comes with only one window valance and as my nursery has 2 windows i had to purchase an additional valance just something to keep in mind when buying this	12
1	this is a great price for a 4 pc set \( i got ours at walmart for 35 \) the comforter is not thick and plushy its very thin and stiff but then again for the price its ok the sheets are adorable we bought a very soft fuzzy dora blanket to go with it but the comforter that comes with it is definately cute maybe after a few washes it will soften up some i would still buy it again for the price but if you are looking for a thick soft warm comfoter then this is not the one you want	12
1	i purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well it is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded my son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way we 've only used it a handful of times so far but i ca n't think of one bad thing to say about it we 're very pleased with our purchase	12
1	i bought these strap covers 1 because my daughter 's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her snugride and2 because i could get them in pink and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time ! this product solved both problems when i took them out of the packaging and realized how big they were i was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft luckily she adapted easily to them and i think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat	12
1	absolutely love it and it 's a great quality too for this price \? \? \? \? i just ca n't believe it ! !	12
1	this is a great item but it does have some flaws i got this for my 2 month old and he loved it ! now he 's 6 months and loves it just as much the thing is you need to manually push the button and then you can use the remote after it plays all the music and it shuts off the only way to turn it back on is to press the button yourself not great when you 're flying on the freeway ! but it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on	12
1	lots of room for more than i need easy to carry cute as a button lots of compliments from strangers has held up for 4 months so far with no problems	12
1	i love the 5 point harness my daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt this seat was easy to install and we love it	12
1	we got our maclaren stroller a few weeks ago we love it my husband and i are both tall me 5'7 and him 6'1 both of us can use this stroller without slouching or kicking the wheels when we walk the stroller folds and unfolds easily and maneuvers beautifully i highly recommend this stroller to anyone who is taller and wants a convenient stroller	12
1	best stroller we own our top of the line graco and jeep strollers sit in the garage now ! it is very light weight easy to use and folds up very neat and tidy	12
1	this new maclaren stroller is fantastic ! we just returned from three weeks in france with this great stroller it can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street it is very light and we love the new shoulder strap i have 3 kids and this is the best stroller i have ever used	12
1	i bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles they were to fast for her like the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that did n't gag her great for little babies that ca n't control their flow control	12
1	i was able to put this dresser together by myself and i was 6 months pregnant the overall look is beautiful a great buy for the money i did buy the fabric railing protectors from babies r us to protect the round railings from a teeting baby since it is made of pine and they fit perfectly	12
1	i love this item with my first son and i got them again for my second son great product keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you do n't have to worry about loose blankets at night	12
1	these cloths are awesome they smell great and do n't crumble like other brands they work well forsponge baths when there 's no time for a real bath ! love them	12
1	i know that after looking at the price tag one might be confused why i say economical however when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands \( for those exploding messes \) they are a value these wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe most of the time of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe i 've ever seen i have only positive remarks for these wipes	12
1	i installed this today though i have n't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy i was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo but after getting it and installing it it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me it also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat i'm giving the chair five stars because i ca n't think of anything negative about it	12
1	i wanted to respond to the other review if you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere please know that the curtains are a darker stripe \( not the tan plaid \) but they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker the border on the wall hangings and quilt the trim on the hamper etc it is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern	12
1	my husband and i ordered these pictures for our sons nursery our theme is barn yard we also got the coordinating lamp light plate switch and night light these pictures really help to complete the room the delivery time was slow \( pictures arrived two days after set date \) but they were definately worth waiting for ! they appear to be actual canvas and acrylic art work i would recommend these to anyone who is looking for the perfect picture to complete their nursery !	12
1	i cringe at the idea that i fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles i might not be able to breastfeed my baby but with my new glass bottles at least i know that i am feeding her the purest form of formula i can possibly give she hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so i bought some silicone ones and was successful when i consider the epidemic of autism in this country i am dedicated to buying pure organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave	12
1	excellent product very difficult to find in stores can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer healthier than heating in plastic	12
1	i had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an avent bottle \( which my first took beautifully \) so i called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice they suggested the evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple they worked great after swearing by avent with my first i never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an old fashioned type bottle it works though so i will stick with them	12
1	i bought this dresser despite some of the negative reviews and believe that it is a good product for the price the dresser seems very sturdy and everything came undamaged it only took my husband and i an hour to put together	12
1	i was given a swaddle me for my third child she has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks my oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not i owe it all to the swaddle me but at three months she outgrew the small size i thought she was old enough to go without swaddling boy was i wrong it took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size i have had my large swaddle me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then thank you swaddle me for helping me keep my sanity	12
1	my granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs she had no problem with the soothie bottle the pacifer she loves the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding like the little cups to hold the powder formual have n't had a problem with the bottles leaking love the ones with the designs of winnie the pooh on them wish they came in the 3 bottle set also wish you could buy the little snack \( formula \) containers seperately not just in the large sets would recommend for any baby	12
1	this is a very useful item it looks great and holds a lot of stuff you can also carry it around from room to room	12
1	while these are n't waterproof they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear so soft and a little more absorbent than the gerber ones they are n't as trim a fit as some of the other brands but my son really likes the roomy feel	12
1	this pail does not need special plastic bags you can use leftover grocery bags etc which is a big advantage i do n't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper a baby 's poop does not smell bad !	12
1	this pillow is the best ! after sleeping with it the first night i new i could n't be without it my husband bought it for me and i am so thankful i left it at my mother 's house one night and i could not sleep i keep waking up the night after getting it back i slept like a baby again if you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this ! its very soft and you can take the cover off to wash it	12
1	i bought elmo underwear from ebay with a sports theme and was done training in a couple of weeks the real underwear incentive did the trick so then i bought more underwear as a reward i got wiggles thomas the tank and nemo underwear from ebay	12
1	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping the crib arrived within a week assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable it 's attractive but my only complaints are 1 \) it did arrive with about five different chipped gouged areas in the white paint \( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint \) and 2 \) the bolts are exposed on the crib it would have looked better if they had provided caps overall i'm very happy with the crib and the price ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may	12
1	this crib came in five days and was in perfect shape we set it up in a reasonable amount of time i can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores	12
1	this crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it 's way great customer service the quality of the bed is outstanding we purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes	12
1	great safe and nice looking bumper ! i would recommend it without hesitation	12
1	i love it ! ! ! u have all that u need for helth care baby here just in one pack ! ! ! u dont need to buy more	12
1	some of the pieces were dent when i opened the box it was too late to returned it back i found out that wood was dented after i had trashed shipping box	12
1	the armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because i was expecting something else i still like it very much but i wanted a part to hang clothes and it does n't have one it is very pretty and from the outside it was everything i was expecting ! ! ! thank you	12
1	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers he just wont sit in them so this product was our solution for him when we are out it is small but my son \( 20 months old \) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere	12
1	the sweet pea bedding set is a good buy the quality of the workmanship is excellent has a high end look for a low end price	12
1	i bought this pump when i was going to a concert and knew i would need to pump while i was out to avoid discomfort and leakage this pump fit in my purse and was easy to use i just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped it was silent and no one even knew	12
1	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer for the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting anyway i'm just writing the review to offset the bad review there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they 're supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table	12
1	i was surprised at what a good size this rug was it matches the bedding perfect the only negative thing i can say about it is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it i put it right in front of my son 's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib it could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place	12
1	product shipped quickly and was well packaged each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting overall the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems	12
1	we just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters they 're great they 're strong enough to keep our 11 month old baby from falling through we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened i still intend to watch him carefully when he 's up there but these will definitely protect him in an emergency just be sure to follow directions tie them tightly ! ! they 're not that bad looks wise either i can still see my spindles through the netting so the look of the stairway is basically unchanged of course looks are less important than safety ! i think i'm going to get these for our outdoor deck as well i 'd recommend them	12
1	the gate works well it is a little hard to move the panels but overall works well	12
1	i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so i am reporting what they said about it great	12
1	my baby has used this since she was 4 months old it has a sturdy wide base it has height adjusters you can recline it very secure safty belts but i do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when i buckle it thats the only thing i dislike about this highchair i dont find it hard to clean it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it 's on sale i paid full price \(	12
1	we bought this crib online could n't be more pleased the shipping was great a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable the directions are n't bad but they could be a lot better clearer we also bought the matching change table it looks great in the baby 's room net great value for a great product !	12
1	easiest purchase just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost	12
1	i'm really pleased with this crib the price was right and it arrived within a matter of days shipping and handling costs were very low a few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow otherwise it looks great and is very sturdy great crib for the price	12
1	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often at just 14 months she could jump with both feet off the ground it is a quality product at a reasonable price would highly recommend	12
1	this is my third child and third infant car seat this was the most expensive but worth the money the padding keeps the baby 's head from that scary 90 degree flop the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids the straps do n't get twisted and it 's much easier to get in and out of the car it 's the same weight as the others \( which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry \) the only thing i do n't like is it does not fit on shopping carts worth the money	12
1	i ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality softness of the fabrics it 's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy i have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed so what i did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition i also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa i have in the room	12
1	i just purchased this crib bedding the quality is great i love the thickness and the velour worth the money	12
1	this is a great walker the tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger my grandson just loves the walker and i do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely amazon sells model 14570 so do n't worry the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary also a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk	12
1	when i was looking for a thermometer for my baby girl i wanted something easy so her father could use it and fast because shes one not to stay still very long i found this one and fell in love with it i use for it for everyone in my family yes i did have a problem finding the covers but that 's not a reason to not to get this thermometer	12
1	great for organizing baby 's food in your diaper bag caution not leak proof be sure to properly seal leftovers ! love the slots that hold spoons	12
1	this item is a great idea for people on the go like me it has removable slots so that you can place a larger bowl in it plus your baby food jar	12
1	there are a few things that i liked about my simple round about better such as the latch system is more difficult in the decathalon overall though very impressive car seat safety system the fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish i always feel safe when my little ones are in a britax well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money you cannot put a price on the safety of your child	12
1	the first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep \( need i say anymore \) \? it fits nearly every shopping cart it 's easy to fold and unfold and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs are n't coming home with us ! well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me	12
1	i highly recommend this item as soon as your little one can sit up on his own this is a must have for all moms it fits all shopping carts \( except costco but including target \) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants it keeps baby \( and mommy 's hands \) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart a must have ! this is the gift i give at baby showers i 've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach still looks good	12
1	we have the one with brown trim but i had to write a review here too because we just love this blanket it 's super soft the perfect size for swaddling and nice and light and still warm for baby we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son but does n't cause him to wake up sweaty it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it 's completely worth the money ! i 'd buy another in a second	12
1	i love this blanket so much let me count the ways \( 1 \) certified organic \( so hard to find \) \( 2 \) large enough for a good tight swaddle \( for a good night sleep \) \( 3 \) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket \( even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse \) \( 4 \) soft soft and softer with every wash ! i just love this blanket and i feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ultimate and i know he loves it too	12
1	we were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the britax marathon carseat on display had a gogo babyz travelmate attached to it it was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun two large solid screw in knobs attach the travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat the whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use we bought both the marathon and travelmate we were looking for a better alternative to the sit 'n stroll this may be it i cannot compare the two options as i have never tried the sit 'n stroll only read the so so reviews	12
1	i decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once this pump works very well and i quickly get the milk i need i like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort i gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied sometimes one side looses suction and while i am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because i had to remove my hand from holding it in place	12
1	i borrowed this pump from a mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work i used it frequently \( at least twice daily \) for the 5 months i pumped at work it always worked wonderfully i never had trouble with let down or supply sometimes i filled both 8 oz bottles in a 15 minute session ! unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply i ca n't imagine this pump not working great i did n't have any problems with it the whole time i used it	12
1	we took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at disney world it was great ! ! it held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses monorail etc i am very pleased with this purchase it was great to have it in the airport too the only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked but we can get a replacement	12
1	i ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to florida on vacation it is absolutely perfect folds small has room for storage you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars it really is perfect for travel actually it is perfect for anytime	12
1	we bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline was lightweight and continues to be a functional comfortable stroller for our son the one feature that i expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go i was happy with the amount of storage but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag all in all we are very happy with this purchase !	12
1	i love this bumper it is n't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely without bunching and the price is much more reasonable than the bumpers that go with bedding sets mostly i can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings i know his arms and legs wo n't get tangled in the railings but he also can breathe great product it is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib	12
1	my daughter ordered this to go with the crib shield system it 's a nice addition to the system and looks very nice	12
1	for all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled that is incorrect it was the original hip hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves so unless you have an older model that was bought before 2 2005 you should have nothing to worry about this product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the baby bjorn i have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies	12
1	i bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and i 'd have to say the reviews i read about on the titan were dead on my 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using i also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward i can still use this seat i wish i had bought this seat from the get go	12
1	out of all the department stores here i got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph for the easness it got noted as lighter and easier to deal with i secound the so far so good comment earlier its comfortable than most seats i have shopped for besides the 1 britax that i have yet to experience \)	12
1	i love these cups and better yet so does my baby ! they are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink she has no idea that it 's not a bottle it has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier thank you	12
1	i absoulutly love these cups they are the best no spill cups on the market my 1 year old loves to walk around with it and throw it around it never spills which is a great thing when i have red kool aid in it ! ! !	12
1	my son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby we have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet ! i will now be putting the bottles away for good this time ! i will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand they are pricey but if i would n't have bought all the other cups i 'd have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place !	12
1	the size is bigger than i thought but i loved it my son fits in nicely	12
1	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
1	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
1	i love this bottle drying rack it does n't take up a lot of space and looks and workds great	12
1	this product works well with my dr brown 's bottles there are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks i use a sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it wo n't scratch the bottles though the sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	12
1	if anyone asked me what baby product i would have to have it would be this product ! i love it and it is very comfortable to use one negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well so do n't let your child use it because they could slip i would purchase it again and would give it as a gift	12
1	this product is good for your knees however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste	12
1	i have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it ! it could be used for a girl or boy i have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything i liked and they seemed high in price well then i found this one and it 's fits perfect on a portable crib and it 's alot cuter than the picture ! i really do like it the only thing is i wish it had a dust ruffel	12
1	my son is just so excited about his sponge bob bed he climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it i like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself	12
1	this bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble it is a great buy for the price you ca n't go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together	12
1	granted it may not work for every single baby \( haha \) but i know a ton of women who swear by this blanket it is the gift i give at every shower do n't second guess yourself about whether or not to get this brand over a less expensive one you wo n't regret it	12
1	my son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver ! when i wrap him in it he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time he can easily break out of the swaddle me but not the miracle blanket i am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends ! !	12
1	i thought these were very good quality considering the price i like them better than the one i bought at bru that cost much more	12
1	when we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it they gave us the diaper depot as well i love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table it has lasted two kids before the one it 's on now so a total of three babies i guess like anything if it 's taken care of properly it wo n't break	12
1	love it and it is a must in our babies room but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer \( lion heart 2004 model \) does not fit correctly to fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer i love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course note we do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and or clean up from showers ! also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery 's them	12
1	i purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training i like that the top has a non slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet she really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training	12
1	my 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the britax boulevard and is loving it she looks comfortable in it and i really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident i can really see her growing into it as well it is a little large for our camry but there is still enough room for one other person \( instead of 2 \) in the backseat	12
1	i bought this portable tent for my graco pack n play because my toddler can climb out of it and i wanted him to be safe we use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 peace of mind knowing that he wo n't be able to escape and injure himself it is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely my only negative comment is that it 's a little difficult to put together i usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity	12
1	i have a climber ! she could climb out of her crib at age 13 months she was way too young for a bed we also have the crib tent ii and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night not roaming her room or house while we sleep it was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room putting a mattress on the floor and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe life saver	12
1	i am surprised to read that people do n't like this mirror we have had it since our son was 1 mon and we still use it at 7 mon we have a trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his britax marathon carseat it has been great for road trips \( our son was entertained even on a 9 hour trip \) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store we do n't always use the music lights but the mirror is always handy we have never had trouble with it being too soft i have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well def recommended	12
1	what a great product no tools just click click click and it 's ready to use the anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress the frame is metal not plastic ! i am very pleased with the quality and the look it was out of the box and on the bed in about 10 minutes	12
1	i bought this w the hippo travel high chair it worked great and kept things cleaner unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck	12
1	i agree with the above reviewers this rug is large and very well made perfect in any little girl 's room	12
1	i have tried just about every diaper rash cream \( desitin balmex mustela vaseline sprays gold bond powder generic brands etc \) but this is the only brand that truly works the oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter 's bum in usually one or two changes best product	12
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum and fast ! we usually see results in just one application usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so it also has a very natural herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much which makes that argument mute	12
1	great buy my daughter loves this stroller i like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back i would recommend this stroller maneuver really well i can do it with my 1 hand fold one hand great great stroller	12
1	this bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever ! i used to go through 8 10 bibs every few days but now this is the only bib i use every day all day ! easy to wash catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it 's easy on easy off !	12
1	it is a very nice product soft and easy but it was an ideal for my daughter 's neck she has neck rash and the plastic ring around the neck was not a good ideal for her	12
1	the bib i 've been waiting for no fuss no muss comfortable and easy to clean the baby bjorn soft bib is a gift from above	12
1	i really like this it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature	12
1	we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing 66 ! the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install this evenflo gate was put together installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs have n't been able to budge it one inch plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls great product at a bargain price we 're ordering three more	12
1	a snap to install my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again problem forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house one remote will opena ll of them pretty stupid design	12
1	i brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet the suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet i going to buy more for my other room	12
1	i have to say this is a better made one than some of the others my mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her how the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached i had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru the arm rest raise up not sure about the drink holder part does n't seem very durable but we will see other than the cover part i feel this will be a good item	12
0	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
0	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
0	i bought this mic in december and after only two nights of singing it completely died ! what a complete disappointment save your money !	13
0	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
0	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	13
0	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
0	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
0	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
0	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
0	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
0	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
0	if you are looking for codes like game shark had this is not for you not only do you have to have a computer if anything happens to the disk you are screwed you wo n't be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion so if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there	13
0	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
0	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
0	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
0	as was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the final fantasy series its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man	13
0	all of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs ing you those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans that game was barely mediocre at best other ff7 releases advent children cell phone game and movie tv show thing all three things resectively sucked now comes dierge of cerberus whoop did eeee doo ! ! the only reason why i rented it was because the title says final fantasy in it the only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes other than that boring if you can get more than 20 minutes through the game then by all means it 's the game for you	13
0	i ca n't stand this game after 5 minutes the game is so unresponsive its not funny the first board i wanted to throw my remote my friend watching asked me what the hell was going on i seriosly did n't move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around at first i thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then i was playing trauma center before and after red steel and not once did i have a problem with the controls seriously the worst game i ever played	13
0	this is a perfect example of false advertisement if you 're like the many that i 've heard of trying to order a remote for the playstation 2 do n't order this one unless you have a newer model the picture shows an ir unit but it does n't come with one so save yourself the hassle and do n't order this	13
0	i saw a dvd player at target for 30 yesterday i especially do n't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it 's 40 ! ! space saving maybe \? \? \?	13
0	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
0	this just sucks the main person just keeps running around he just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he wo n't peddle but gos backwards quite well tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked atleast i bought it used and for not much money maybe ill find a fix and try it again later	13
0	i have n't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my ps2 after the ps2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim ps2 have called to say it does n't work but they do n't have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many ps2 's do not buy if you do n't want the risk of it not working ! ! ! !	13
0	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
0	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
0	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
0	i gave it one star because there was no way to give it less this game when played on the x box was great so when it came out for pc i bought it big mistake ! the control are too hard to learn and when you are in a battle you ca n't stop to think which keys when used together work there are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing i wasted my money on this game i deleted it and will never play it do n't waste your money	13
0	this is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection i 've ever experienced i bought this game new at a local store because i 've been itching to play simcity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed tried it with the other disc failed again went to the company 's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund	13
0	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
0	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
0	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
0	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
0	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
0	this is supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc a shoddy product	13
0	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
0	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13
0	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
0	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
0	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
0	when i bought the xbox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke i do n't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months i ca n't say the person that sold me the xbox has even tried to email me since i 've emailed him hmmmm	13
0	this game is horrible i rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it i had wasted 5 bucks its patheticic you cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay pros sunny can bite yaycons horrbiel graphicsonly 3 playable charactersbad humorshort cutscenesu cant do anything1 path gamehardly 3d \( seriously it doesnt look like it	13
0	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
0	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
0	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13
0	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
0	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
0	if you are looking for an xbox vertsion of another chapter in mechwarrior series this isn't it this is an extemely dumbed down version of mw even if you \( mechwarrior fans \) forget about having no customization remember this you can only fire one weapon at at time you have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets i was bored after about 5 minutes again people who never played mw series may like this game better	13
0	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
0	every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie \( from russia with love which is actually not a bad game \) recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply could n't resist picking up scarface the world is yours i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love this but it turns out i did n't the controls are really a joke instead of your normal fps 3ps rpg etcetera there are really bland controls you ca n't even tell what to do the dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke for die hard fans only i guess	13
0	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
0	i noticed there were not many new items in this game i found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving this expansion ws not worth the money	13
0	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
0	nothing more really needs to be said i'm running a 3ghz p4 256mb ati radeon 9000 series pci express video card and 2gb of ram and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer i tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect do not buy this gam	13
0	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
0	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
0	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	13
0	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13
0	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
0	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	13
0	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
0	do n't buy this here it is selling for 49 99 at best buy \( bestbuy com \) wait until they lower the price on amazon	13
0	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
0	i rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and could n't get past it do n't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	13
0	pointless quests with no real conclusions ctd every 30 45 minutes lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment all in all a very unpolished product even with the patch if your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game	13
0	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
0	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why \? the first was very good	13
0	i bought this game when it was 50 because i thought it would be a great game i was wrong you dont get a lightsabre until far into the game and all the advertisments shows you with a lightsabre the game is extremely buggy and has poor graphics i am a huge starwars fan and would not reccomend this game to anyone no matter how big of a starwars fan they are dont buy this game	13
0	i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here 's an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children 's word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i could n't progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i did n't want to ! i'm not saying it 's a bad game it 's just probably not a good game for grownups	13
0	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
0	this remote is of awful quality i 've been through two of them in the past year i would n't complain so much if it did n't cost 30 ! it 's worth ten at most most people would be better off buying a cheap dvd player rather than using the xbox	13
0	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
0	my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we 've enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles were n't really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there were n't many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead	13
0	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
0	both this game and danger by design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games \( shadow ranch the last train to blue moon canyon secret of the old clock etc \) the game was short and i thought the tasks were a bit dull i also found it somewhat confusing switching between nancy drew and the hardy boys hopefully her interactive will produce something better next time because these games really are addictive even for adults	13
0	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	13
0	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
0	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
0	there are pros and cons of this card pros its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordablecons games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save ! sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car	13
0	i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i	13
0	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
0	after playing this game for the third time i had a thought 'why did i buy this ! ' this game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly i cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other nba street 's save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game	13
0	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
0	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
0	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
0	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
0	the controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything i'm a long time gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme plus for all the people talking about immersion i just do n't see it i just could n't get myself to care about the world or story i was in it did n't grab me like some games do	13
0	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
0	now before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster \( grudgingly playing it though \) and now for the unbaiased opinion i think that this game is so completely stupid it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion	13
0	i really could not tell you anything as i still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago	13
0	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	13
0	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
0	this game is just the original a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at all ! ! i hate this game so much ! ! it is literally the worst dbz game i have ever played and i have played them all \) i advise you if ur looking for a new dbz game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system do not buy this game ever ! ! ! !	13
0	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
0	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
0	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
0	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
0	as far as i am concerned this game is total garbage and i would not recomend it to any one i do not know why it was ever released ! ! deer hunter 2003 is the same way i tossed both of them in the garbage trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story the game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers	13
0	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
0	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
0	stay away from this product my intercooler while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months but i continously got random red circles of death until my 360 got another one today and couldnt recover this product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first terrible product that cost me 140 and a whole month without my xbox while i wait for it to be repaired	13
0	the intercooler can and in my case did damage my 360 it sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360 which caused component failure the worst part \? as it 's not an approved accessory for the 360 any damage it causes will void your warranty and you 'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket	13
0	i was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system i sent it back and got another one the second intercooler did not work either it makes a nice paperweight !	13
0	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
0	this game is a joke ! it is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 it took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games \( he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them \) do n't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out it is was a waste of money my kids wo n't even play it it should be rated n for nobody	13
0	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
0	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
0	we have been unsuccessful with this e reader attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money	13
0	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
0	i purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just could n't run it i put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again the computer i have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work i contacted tech support and got what i am now sure are just something for me to try until i quit trying and leave them alone it worked they win they got my money and i got jack	13
0	the copy of simcity4 that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press 2 now ea 's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes ! i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code ! i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product	13
0	i bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that i need one for each gba or sp so i bought another one for my son then after we could n't get them to work consulted nintendo we found that the wireless adapter does n't work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version some gift	13
0	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
0	i really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak 3 whoa major mistake this game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe i was very disappointed in this game if you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere	13
0	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
0	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	13
0	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
0	first thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 caesar games out there having said that this game had a major bug right at the release how is that possible \? is it unreasonable to expect a u s company to produce a flawless product \? probably not but tilted mill has some of the the best pros in the industry basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess the advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer far better to go with civcity 3	13
0	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
0	she is just right for me i know im a little to hot for her but i think wed make hollywoods cuttist couple	13
0	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
0	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
0	sid meier 's reputation was unblemished after the civil war series civilization and the original releases of railroad tycoon but this game release is a major setback that will make me hesitate about any future products carrying his name this is a major derailment it is the fastest that i have ever firmly known that a new game was being removed from my hard drive take a look at how many used copies are already flooding the market and this game just released less than two weeks ago every aspect is made into chewing gum where you were used to having steak there is no expansion tweak or update that can fix how seriously dumbed down this version is	13
0	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
0	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
0	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
0	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
0	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13
0	i bought this adaptor because my kids and i have both the nintendo ds and ds lite it works great on the original ds but the thing that 's supposed to fit into the ds lite is too wide if you 're looking for an adaptor for just the regular ds this one works great if for the ds lite do n't waste your money	13
0	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
0	i do n't even have to explain the worst bait and switch tatic i have ever seen horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible amazon bait and switch i will never shop on amazon again	13
0	as was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the final fantasy series its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man	13
0	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
0	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
0	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
0	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
0	if you are looking for an xbox vertsion of another chapter in mechwarrior series this isn't it this is an extemely dumbed down version of mw even if you \( mechwarrior fans \) forget about having no customization remember this you can only fire one weapon at at time you have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets i was bored after about 5 minutes again people who never played mw series may like this game better	13
0	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
0	every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie \( from russia with love which is actually not a bad game \) recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply could n't resist picking up scarface the world is yours i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love this but it turns out i did n't the controls are really a joke instead of your normal fps 3ps rpg etcetera there are really bland controls you ca n't even tell what to do the dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke for die hard fans only i guess	13
0	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
0	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
0	i noticed there were not many new items in this game i found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving this expansion ws not worth the money	13
0	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
0	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
0	nothing more really needs to be said i'm running a 3ghz p4 256mb ati radeon 9000 series pci express video card and 2gb of ram and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer i tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect do not buy this gam	13
0	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
0	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
0	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	13
0	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13
0	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
0	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	13
0	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
0	i plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver the receiver light kept blinking which means that it did n't recognize the controller after several tries i decided that the product is defective and returned it	13
0	this just sucks the main person just keeps running around he just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he wo n't peddle but gos backwards quite well tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked atleast i bought it used and for not much money maybe ill find a fix and try it again later	13
0	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
0	i rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and could n't get past it do n't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	13
0	pointless quests with no real conclusions ctd every 30 45 minutes lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment all in all a very unpolished product even with the patch if your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game	13
0	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
0	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why \? the first was very good	13
0	i bought this game when it was 50 because i thought it would be a great game i was wrong you dont get a lightsabre until far into the game and all the advertisments shows you with a lightsabre the game is extremely buggy and has poor graphics i am a huge starwars fan and would not reccomend this game to anyone no matter how big of a starwars fan they are dont buy this game	13
0	i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here 's an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children 's word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i could n't progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i did n't want to ! i'm not saying it 's a bad game it 's just probably not a good game for grownups	13
0	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
0	this remote is of awful quality i 've been through two of them in the past year i would n't complain so much if it did n't cost 30 ! it 's worth ten at most most people would be better off buying a cheap dvd player rather than using the xbox	13
0	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
0	my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we 've enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles were n't really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there were n't many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead	13
0	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
0	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	13
0	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
0	this is supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc a shoddy product	13
0	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
0	there are pros and cons of this card pros its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordablecons games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save ! sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car	13
0	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
0	i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i	13
0	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
0	after playing this game for the third time i had a thought 'why did i buy this ! ' this game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly i cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other nba street 's save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game	13
0	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
0	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
0	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
0	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
0	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
0	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
0	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
0	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
0	the controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything i'm a long time gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme plus for all the people talking about immersion i just do n't see it i just could n't get myself to care about the world or story i was in it did n't grab me like some games do	13
0	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
0	now before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster \( grudgingly playing it though \) and now for the unbaiased opinion i think that this game is so completely stupid it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion	13
0	i really could not tell you anything as i still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago	13
0	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	13
0	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
0	i gave it one star because there was no way to give it less this game when played on the x box was great so when it came out for pc i bought it big mistake ! the control are too hard to learn and when you are in a battle you ca n't stop to think which keys when used together work there are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing i wasted my money on this game i deleted it and will never play it do n't waste your money	13
0	this game is just the original a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at all ! ! i hate this game so much ! ! it is literally the worst dbz game i have ever played and i have played them all \) i advise you if ur looking for a new dbz game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system do not buy this game ever ! ! ! !	13
0	this is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection i 've ever experienced i bought this game new at a local store because i 've been itching to play simcity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed tried it with the other disc failed again went to the company 's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund	13
0	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
0	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
0	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
0	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
0	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
0	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
0	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
0	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
0	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
0	as far as i am concerned this game is total garbage and i would not recomend it to any one i do not know why it was ever released ! ! deer hunter 2003 is the same way i tossed both of them in the garbage trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story the game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers	13
0	this intercooler will ruin your 360 with prolonged use i was getting error 68 codes and could n't figure out why turns out it was the intercooler sucking too much power from the 360 do not buy this product	13
0	i had this in my cart and just thought it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment i cannot thank all of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do thank you all again ! mckinle	13
0	this product was not designed by the 360 team and really most products that are n't are n't very good for your 360 this is no exception it can and has been known to actually damage and destroy your 360 a statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people mainly because it actually draws power from the 360 and that 's not good and leads to a lot of other problems	13
0	my xbox was getting the red rings of death figured this was most likely due to overheating so i bought this thing not only did it not fix any of my troubles i was having more whenever i would bump my xbox the whole thing would shut off instantly found this out by accident come to find out this thing has very bad connections so for 20 you can buy more headaches than microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts	13
0	this is the worst item you can get for your 360 i got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360 it was crashing and freezing and ultimately i had to get my console repaired do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby \( 360 \)	13
0	i bought this for my xbox 360 and it does n't work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews i 've read here at least by not working it is n't damaging my xbox 360	13
0	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
0	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
0	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
0	this game is a joke ! it is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 it took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games \( he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them \) do n't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out it is was a waste of money my kids wo n't even play it it should be rated n for nobody	13
0	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
0	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
0	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
0	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
0	i bought this mic in december and after only two nights of singing it completely died ! what a complete disappointment save your money !	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
0	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	13
0	i purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just could n't run it i put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again the computer i have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work i contacted tech support and got what i am now sure are just something for me to try until i quit trying and leave them alone it worked they win they got my money and i got jack	13
0	the copy of simcity4 that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press 2 now ea 's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes ! i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code ! i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product	13
0	i bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that i need one for each gba or sp so i bought another one for my son then after we could n't get them to work consulted nintendo we found that the wireless adapter does n't work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version some gift	13
0	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
0	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
0	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
0	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
0	if you are looking for codes like game shark had this is not for you not only do you have to have a computer if anything happens to the disk you are screwed you wo n't be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion so if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there	13
0	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
0	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
0	i dont have much to say other than i did not like this game i was hoping that it was going to be like fusion frenzy for the xbox but it was not nearly as fun the controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good some people may like it but i did n't	13
0	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
0	i really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak 3 whoa major mistake this game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe i was very disappointed in this game if you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere	13
0	this is a perfect example of false advertisement if you 're like the many that i 've heard of trying to order a remote for the playstation 2 do n't order this one unless you have a newer model the picture shows an ir unit but it does n't come with one so save yourself the hassle and do n't order this	13
0	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
0	i saw a dvd player at target for 30 yesterday i especially do n't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it 's 40 ! ! space saving maybe \? \? \?	13
0	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
0	i would blame this game sucking on the wii it is unfortunate that the sequel to cod2 had to be this game i played it on the x box 360 and it was n't good there either i was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour after that i could n't bring myself to touch it again	13
0	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	13
0	i have n't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my ps2 after the ps2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim ps2 have called to say it does n't work but they do n't have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many ps2 's do not buy if you do n't want the risk of it not working ! ! ! !	13
0	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
0	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
0	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
0	first thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 caesar games out there having said that this game had a major bug right at the release how is that possible \? is it unreasonable to expect a u s company to produce a flawless product \? probably not but tilted mill has some of the the best pros in the industry basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess the advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer far better to go with civcity 3	13
0	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
0	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
0	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
0	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
0	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13
0	when i bought the xbox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke i do n't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months i ca n't say the person that sold me the xbox has even tried to email me since i 've emailed him hmmmm	13
0	this game is horrible i rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it i had wasted 5 bucks its patheticic you cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay pros sunny can bite yaycons horrbiel graphicsonly 3 playable charactersbad humorshort cutscenesu cant do anything1 path gamehardly 3d \( seriously it doesnt look like it	13
0	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
1	i really liked this game im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game all the time i dont why i would buy it if i were you ! ! ! very fun challenging at the same time !	13
1	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
1	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
1	if you 're going to play karaoke revolution this is the mic for you i now have 2 so that my wife and i can play in duet mode it 's much better than the headset for just 17 bucks you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural if you play kr a lot invest in this microphone	13
1	i am so glad i purchased the logitech mic for ps2 the quality of the sound is awesome and my kids are having a blast with it the price is reasonable my kids take very good care of things but i'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment i will probably end up buying another one	13
1	it has some flaws you will have to run around a bit between play areas but it plays well enough the price is right and it is worth the time you will spend on it the learning curve is small and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the cd if you look for them \( a neat extra \) it has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new \( though you do have a quot partner quot you can exploint during battle \) but it is a good change of sceenary i liked it enough to want to finish it i think you will too	13
1	if you like diablo 1 this is exactly the same game only improved 300 percent if not for blizzards bnet and all the multiplayer options i would say that this game is also better than diablo	13
1	i'm not a big fan of the diablo d amp d typr game but this game is really neat the one big advantage of this game over diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game very high replay value also makes this game a winner pick up a copy if you can i 've seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store for the price you ca n't go wrong	13
1	i just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars i had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox \( i 've been a ps2 fan for a while \) after i played the first couple of levels i was not dissapointed this game is simply amazing even today i ca n't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out the gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics the sound and music to the game is awsome i highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning	13
1	halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time this is definately a good game to play if you 've never played a first person shooter also if you have an xbox you should get this because it is awesome ratingsgraphics then 10 now 7sound 10replayability 6controls 10drawn in atmosphere 9fun 9multiplayer co op 9 multiplay	13
1	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
1	this looked to be the new circuit board with flash ram and new modification options for the enthusiast the package was certainly new but the circuit board was the original version 1 you 'll need to go to great lengths to make sure you 're getting a version 2 if it 's possible at all good luck	13
1	brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	13
1	this is the game for race lovers awesome graphics car responce is just like the real thing photo lab is very nice too \( you can take pics of your rides \) you will never get bored of this game a must have	13
1	really it is a good game on war buy it since it \( he \) is very goo	13
1	used this product to softmod my xbox had to download an older version of the software though if you just use it to cheat in games probably not worth the money	13
1	can you use the action relpay on ur xbox for multiplayergames like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo because that is the only reason why i want to use this product is so that i can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload i would want invinsibility but then it would be obvious that i was cheatin and when u read that u probablly thought well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo but still i would like to know this before i buy it i will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do	13
1	yes i am a die hard star wars fan and yes i love a good mission based action game so man if this is n't the perfect game for me ! it 's so much fun and there 's so much freedom in the game in itself ! add on to that the space missions and wow this game totally blows me away ! highly recommended for anyone who is a star wars fan a fps fan or a fan of fun gameplay	13
1	i have been playing the madden series since i was a kid and this game is really good the games just keep getting better and better as each year passes everything in this game is worth the money i strongly reccommend it	13
1	it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline	13
1	this game is a great one i enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites i recommend this game for anyone who enjoys final fantasy or a good rpg	13
1	this is perhaps the best of the final fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated ix had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay the characters are some of the most delightful in the series personally i think vivi and zidane are the coolest characters ever lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline on a sidenote this game definitely deserves a remake there 's a lot of hype about final fantasy vii its own prequel and a remake coming for ps3 i feel that final fantasy ix should be remade on the ps3 i love the story line better than vii the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible	13
1	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
1	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
1	it was a great game that can include your whole family or entertain people at a party sometimes when you have a lot of people over you can even have a dance party overall its a great game and i recommend you buy it	13
1	if you already have an eye toy and your favorite game on it is beat freak then you have to get eye toy groove the 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from elvis to good charlotte as a 46 year old woman i got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in this is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 even the preschoolers i occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than i can say for dance dance revolution	13
1	i bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact i have n't heard any noise he is to busy playing it	13
1	this controller feels great in your hands in fact after using this controller for awhile my batteries went low and i had to switch back to the dualshock controller the dualshock felt wierd in my hands the response of the controller is good i have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time one down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time i guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year	13
1	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
1	i came upon this game as a demo from sony i downloaded it onto my psp and was hooked within 5 minutes i needed to have the full game do n't let the child like voices and images steer you clear of this game if you are an older gamer trust me you will have some fun the only thing is i did beat it a little too fast still very fun	13
1	this controller is great you are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest this controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus	13
1	i 've played them all and enjoyed them all sorry this was the last one	13
1	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
1	in case you havent' noticed this is a controller not a game so as far as the controller goes it works great and i have not had a single problem with it	13
1	it is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the playstation 2 that have a built in ir receiver which is why it does n't include it	13
1	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
1	this is a great cable for your hd tv while playing you sony playstation 2 it give very crisp and clear images much better than the cable that comes with the playstation	13
1	these component av cables make a world of difference in video quality especially on hdtv some images now appear pixelated this may be the game i am playing but everything else is smooth crisp and clear text is three times as easy to read i reccomend these for any hdtv owner	13
1	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
1	this is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play the addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title when you 're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms you begin to realize this game is really special	13
1	this game is really good theres a wide varity of lvls to play and a very good multyplayer system the game only has a few faults like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship the game also gets a little boring after a while besides that its a great game	13
1	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
1	this game is great for when you have a group of friends come over it really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining i suggest this game for everybody	13
1	i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it 's definitely for all ages even my two year old ca n't get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes	13
1	i do n't know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough we plugged it in on christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since the selection of songs is excellent the sing and dance feature brings sends this game way out in front of earlier editions \( which we also have \) the eye toy is a good addition just everything about it is first rate i ca n't think of a single drawback my only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family parents too	13
1	rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games	13
1	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13
1	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
1	this game was a new experience for me i did n't think i would like it but i did i like the story telling and it keeps you interested overall interesting fun and it will entertain you	13
1	i really really enjoyed this game it was the only game i played for almost 2 months i was so hooked on it my only criticism is that the missions are too rigid so the outcomes are very much the same during re play even if you make different choices i thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do e g too much eating and he gets fat	13
1	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
1	first off the eyetoy is a great game peripheral next it 's getting some new games as well as it will be useable on the next gen console ps3 third it is usable as a webcam on the pc in fact it is a fantastic webcam only you need to download a inf \( a driver \) for the webcam there 's tutorials out there google it	13
1	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
1	we got a group of 5 friends together to do guitar hero 1 and 2 ddr and now karaoke revolution party it 's freaking cool the songs list is very good and there 's something for everyone easy to figure out too	13
1	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
1	i love it that card my childrens have one for your own games	13
1	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
1	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
1	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
1	back when it came out on xbox i was incredibly angry i only had a silly gameboy but when it came out for computer i just had to have it i found the game very fun to play simple controls \( use arrows not wasd \) and felt very fufilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle it does n't take long to finish this game but play is continuous \( if you watch the entire credits \) and you can always start over and switch to evil good side for a new version of the game	13
1	right just so everyone knows i have never played this game however i think you should read this i bought fable and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it it is good enough but not supported so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible as they have actually put a list of cards on the site i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game just thought you should know	13
1	i would be 5 on this one all the way because i enjoyed the game immensly \( the general idea of the game \) but because of personal preference i stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art if you like this game but do n't want all the questionable material \( yes i know that it 's nothing compared to other games \) then may i recommend fate by wildtangen	13
1	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
1	first things first there is a mute button on this unit if a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off i'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either did n't read the instructions or could n't figure out a product with three buttons on it \( power mute volume up and volume down \) second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a logitech wireless controller it works well and i noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular xbox communicator	13
1	pros 1 \) wireless2 \) small3 \) lightweight4 \) you can talk to your friends when you 're in the bathroom 5 \) it has a lot of noises to tell you it 's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max cons 1 \) cliking and poping noises2 \) my charger does n't connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 \) there is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 \) have to charge it why ca n't it just have a fuel cell \? 5 \) no mute statis or indicator 6 \) it makes poping noises and a white nois	13
1	your back in liberty city \( just like gta 3 \) you cant fly swim clime \( just like gta 3 \) no graphics upgrade no airplanes glitches like crazy same as psp but if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong	13
1	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
1	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
1	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
1	i played this game with some friends out of town and seriously had to acquire a ps2 just to satisfy my craving not a shooter game not an rpg you just roll seriously it 's surprisingly awesome actually but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing it was done i 'd beat it and i'm really not a big gamer and i do n't know how much mileage i'm really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2 player mode maybe the sequel is better i hope	13
1	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
1	i got this game for my kids one is 11 and one is 9 they love it they can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it like baseball soccer boxing etc hey this even come with the camera i rated 4 stars because of the graffics they are not the best but still acceptible hope this review helps	13
1	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
1	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
1	pros exciting and absorbing story line great gaming experience cons some minor bugs single player game cannot replay more than a few times	13
1	this was a well put together game that was lots of fun to play you 'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it i'm not a big star wars fan but i was nuts for this game this was the first rpg i ever tried and once i got over the fact that i was not doing the fighting i really liked it i highly recommend this game unless you already have a weak relationship with your wife kids \( who you wo n't be seeing much of \) or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary eyed so he can pink slip you	13
1	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
1	no way should children be playing this game it is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players the goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it 's just a fantasy many people go into the details so i 'll make this short have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts but there 's no way i would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then i would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy	13
1	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
1	time crises is a 5 star gam	13
1	you already knew it was a good game becuase it 's final fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games this one is probably a little worse than the best final fantasy games \( such as iii and vii \) but despite that what you have here is a game boy advance rpg that has graphics that actually are n't that bad and the storyline is pretty good too you just ca n't go wrong with final fantasy games	13
1	before kurt warner had a career with the st louis rams he played for the arenabowl champion iowa barnstomers when he endorsed this game called kurt warner 's arena football unleashed the music is rockin' and up to date you can crank it up to the sound effects are great on this game if you hear that doink ! sound it looks like a hanna barbera cartoon and the commentary is way better than that tim guy from nfl blitz oh and for every touchdown you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6 this game is way more better than nfl blitz unfortunately it was the last hope for any more arena football games on any system	13
1	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
1	he was exelente but i continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the spanish on the item thus they tendrian but trade here in venezuela without but one takes leave of youemerson	13
1	people plz ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable	13
1	i like the 05 version better sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it does n't appear to me ea sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter i was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe i was expecting too much i wo n't buy the 07 when it comes out i 'll wait and see what they can do with it on playstation 3	13
1	the good it has fairly good graphics the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 did n't like the truck stick and nfl superstarthe bad once you 've played this for awhile you 'll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game it get old when you look into the crowd in a game the graphics suck it looks like a big blob of colorsoverall it is a really fun game i hope madden 07 will be better though	13
1	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
1	i love this game i have n't played other ddr games before so i'm not sure how it compares to others but this one is great some of the songs i like a lot and some i do n't but they 're all a challenge and fun in some way i like to use the dance master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well i have n't made it all that far because i play the same levels over and over again because they 're so fun this game is great for people of all ages and includes music for the young and old	13
1	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
1	i 've been a gta fan for a few years now and to me san andreas has got to be the best one for the first time you can swim ! ! i fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character the graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you 'll get used to it the language is terrible \( more so in this gta version \) so young kids should avoid this like the plague	13
1	there 's a reason everyone loves this game there 's a lot of exciting action ! the popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it 's almost ridiculous driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game it 's a game you have to own if you 're a fan of video games	13
1	whatever product sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a top quality product and these sony memory card for ps2 is just the perfect exampl	13
1	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
1	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
1	all the family have played this game and have had a blast sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids the graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun we also own the movie	13
1	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	13
1	there are a lot of different memory cards on the market for the ps2 but the official sony 8mb memory card is by far the best card for your system unlike other memory cards available this baby will not fail you that means you can depend on it at all times so to make a long story short do yourself a favor and buy this ever reliable memory card	13
1	this memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced i did n't have to worry about this because mine came with my ps2 it can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game if you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng	13
1	this game i purchased for my sons they both told me they enjoyed this game a little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges if you want a game that is not too easy this is the one ! have fun and do n't let losing take the fun away it is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills	13
1	neat game but i should n't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 the 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i'm the 'hero of kavatch' but i do n't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently does n't entitle me to even pick up an item if i do n't own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic	13
1	my son loves this game ! we rented it first from blockbuster and now he wo n't let us take it back so i ordered it from amazon com so i can take the game back soon to blockbuster ! i have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but i do n't mind because it 's fun	13
1	we rented this game for my kids to play with each other the game is labeled 1 2 players but is made for only one player at a single ps2 console the kids are disappointed because now they have to take turns watching each other be aware	13
1	i have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters they can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect	13
1	this is a good system with great graphics and a number of good games supports online multiplayer too with an xbox live subscription the only problem i have with the system is that sometimes it freezes i 've had it for about 5 months and it 's probably frozen about 8 or 9 times which can be annoying esp when im in the middle of a game other than that it 's a good system	13
1	if your tired of all the first person shooters and rpgs this game rocks it was 1990 all over again for me love the game since i didnt have anm original playstation i can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me \) the only issue i have is that you cant play 2 player but i can forgive that	13
1	great shooter game great graphics 100 ship variation this game is five dollars at toys r us	13
1	i really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters so take this opinion with that in mind the only problem with r type is that dying sucks when you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups once you unlock free play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc however overall i think it 's the best of the r types and one of the better side scrollers out there	13
1	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
1	when i first came home with this game and tried it i thought it was going to be kind of dumb but it is lots of fun and kind of addicting i even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking plus it is a good price	13
1	i purchased this game for my son and he loves it he plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars i'm glad that we selected this game for him he also has underground hot pursuit and he enjoys that one also	13
1	gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 xbox and ps2 's controllers have buttons that are the same size it 's really confusing really on gamecube 's you know the a buttons the big one b 's the small one and x and y are the kidney shaped ones hard to tell them apart right	13
1	why mess with the original there are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount you get what you pay for i have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality in addition the controls for the gamecube are similar enough to other nintendo products so you wo n't have to learn a completely new system	13
1	the nintendo ds is outstanding it makes playing games and communicating a breeze	13
1	i am using brainage game with this very challenging and i have improved my performance	13
1	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
1	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
1	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
1	ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular fps \( first person shooter \) games out there ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that i know still play cs today like myself from planting bombs to rescuing hostages you 'll find this game enjoyable there are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 the screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers if your looking for a great fps game this is it	13
1	in the april 2005 pc gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time half life was 1 this is basically a sequel to that game very fun except when you 're in a server with hackers in it just make sure to never give your cd key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it \( for version 1 6 \) then go to browse games and register your cd key once you do that you wo n't be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years	13
1	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
1	you will not be dissapointed by buying this game ! if you like rpgs action and or adventure games you 'll love this one there is soooooo much to do ! even after you 've beat the game with the huge maps tons of free roaming space and exciting side missions you can play for hours without even starting the main mission the sound and graphics are just about the best i 've ever seen ! the mian story is also awesome it 's easy to follow and tons of fun to play ! buy this ! ! ! !	13
1	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
1	i have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters they can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect	13
1	this game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play you do n't exactly finish it like other video games but are always trying to beat your fastest time so it does n't get old as fast as a matter of fact we wore out our last copy and this is our second i love it and i'm the parent ! my kids and i play it together and cheer each other on the only thing i would change is make the two player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally i would keep them in the corner instead overall highly recommend this game more than your money 's worth	13
1	this game is a lot of fun the level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music is n't as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days	13
1	this headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear the big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use wearing the halo 2 headset i actually forgot that i was even wearing it because it is so light they have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price i greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	13
1	this headset is way better than the x box one considering the x box one broke in a hurry the sound quality is awesome and you do n't get any annoying breathing in the mic pick this one up	13
1	i love this game and i 've been playing it every since it came out its not one of those boring after a whilepros good graphics good gameplay lots of mechs live support content download \( a lot ! \) up to 8 people on xbox live lots of missionscons can get a bit repetetiv	13
1	mechassault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine destroying other mechs and tanks as well but when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again \? no not if you have xbox live in live you can play capture the flag download new mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more if you do n't have xbox live or a system link that your wasting your money	13
1	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
1	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
1	this game is truly worth the wait it really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting the gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the gta games this is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome this probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in the cars handle great and are a blast to drive the graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome this is a must get game	13
1	i picked this up along with zelda when buying the wii this game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is so fun ! i love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road the action is fast and the driving is very intuitive \( provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts \) it 's not too hard anyone can play and it 's just fun i love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me highly recommended do n't overlook this game !	13
1	this game is better than madden by a nose but could be better gameplay is better than madden i think	13
1	no other game looks or plays like this the missions and locations are varied and colorful the villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials and as usual rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating lots of unlockables offer high replay this is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period i still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru the story is straightforward and engaging lots of really interesting concepts \( machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole 'dead eye' thing \) and it controls very well another great game from an outstanding company hopefully a sequel is in the works	13
1	this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49 99 buy this game cause they copied it	13
1	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west i try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is awesome i cant wait for the new western game gun coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme \) that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying	13
1	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
1	totally awesome my favorite game ever the sound is revolutionary the graphics are top notch it is so real you 'll freak although the ps2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics so i would buy the ps2 version if i were you a must own for every gamer it will change your life	13
1	all i had to do was plug it into the console and bring up xbox live and it connected the only thing i did not like is that i would have preferred an ethernet connection in lieu of the usb connection other than that the product worked as intended	13
1	expensive but worth it it just works no more wires	13
1	i enjoy having wireless especially with broadband i have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong set up is easy for most although if you have a linksys router wrt 54g ver 2 get ready for some work it took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice since then i have not had any problems a little expensive but worth it in the long run	13
1	i used a linksys media center extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater this product completley replaced the need for the extender was extremely easy to setup \( wep enabled \) and works flawlessly i do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a media center pc the music streaming is every bit as good setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code well done microsoft ! tom las vega	13
1	what else needs to be said even with a low end graphics card this masterpiece is fun ! perfect combination for a laptop notebook too bad sir william gates wo n't allow a pc version of halo 2 well anyways seeya in halo 3 deathmatc	13
1	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
1	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13
1	love this game great story line just make sure your computer can handle it	13
1	action action and satisfaction ! totally awesome and entirtaining this videogame will rock your world ! cool new characters and weapons tactics and awsomeness	13
1	this game is very goodit jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don	13
1	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
1	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	13
1	with the wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one some preordered it while some others \( including me \) are camping out for it but some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction sure sideways wii controllers are s nes controllers but what of gamecubes \? i am happy to say that i have gotten a chance to play around with the wii before anyone else and yes the wavebird receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the wii it looks pefectly at home there rejoice gamers ! pick up your wavebirds and play on	13
1	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
1	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
1	i have always loved mario and when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite i bought this with it this game is absolutely amazingly fun ! the graphics sound and the game itself are incredible this game is good for any adult or child although for a younger child it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating \) with this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again and possibly again after that but every time you try again you understand something new about the level and it really is fun there also are the features of becoming mega mario and mini mario which mixes things up every once and a while this game is wonderful definitely a great buy	13
1	i bought the game for my daughter but i play it more than she does this game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love super mario bros	13
1	gta iii rules but its not the greatest game ever thats why it gets overall of 4 but it still is awesome but grand theft auto vice city rules even harder ! ! ! xbox version is best	13
1	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
1	if you ever played any kotor game u know that its the king of rpgs and i know that u all want the 3rd game to come out to but it isent ! the game got cancelled and a bunch of guys online are tryin to resurect the kotor series by making this petition we dont have no where nere as much as we should 'round 3600 so help us out and go to petition online and help us resurect this great series ! ! !	13
1	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
1	the reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because i am currently running a game of iwd1 with windows xp as i make this post	13
1	this game is great for those that enjoy role playing games there is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story it was a lot of fu	13
1	you know what \? i absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard i beat it on normal in one week ! and this was when it first came out when i was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen but anyway this game was so fun ! i got it the week it came out and that christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it i have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old	13
1	and three years later i buy the game wow ! awesome ! i ca n't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release ! everything looks and feels great on my xp this is one of the only games i have purchased and and not had to return due to the cd being messed up or some corrupted file so i'm happy ! i thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on yep this is a game i would suggest to any gamer	13
1	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
1	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
1	yeah this game is really fun just gets extremely hard at times towards the end have a little over 10 hours into it kind of short i guess but each mission might take you a few tries to complete plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like i did i 'd say it 's easily one of the best games out for the ds though one that everyone should have in their ds collection	13
1	this game is so creative it 's really atypical and really exciting	13
1	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
1	my husband just bought this for my five year old daughter \( preschool graduation gift \) \) she has n't been able to leave it alone now she 's a little more advanced in the world of gaming than some her age and definitely better than me her mom so i ca n't recommend it for every kid but if your kid is adept at x box they should enjoy this one it does n't hurt that she loves the movie as well	13
1	i \( 37 \) played this game with my nephew \( 8 \) the other night on his birthday this is a great game funny characters have great individual personalities traits ! just like ever with any cool game we started playing laughed alot lost track of time 1 hour had passed he was playing ps2 im buying it for my xbox tonight you should buy it for your system definitely worth it ! !	13
1	this product is excellent has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time good perfromanc	13
1	this is a great memory card for people with only a few gcn games but those who have a bigger collection will either need to buy two or the gcn memory card 1019	13
1	my kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	13
1	unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game and the story mode is a bit weak however they make up in that with the classic mode and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase i reccomend you buy this rather than thug1 or thaw i garantee you will enjoy this game for a while	13
1	this product arrived quickly and in excellent shape thanks for being a quality shop this product is hard to find in a store thanks again	13
1	best fighting game i have played in a long time the characters are coo	13
1	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
1	this game was great ! it 's easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast in this one nancy is on a train that might be haunted lori girard \( your host \) invites a bunch of people including frank and joe hardy \( you actually get to play as frank in one part of the game \) then odd things start happening on the train lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train 's emergency brake is pulled this is a really fun game !	13
1	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
1	i dont know what everyone else 's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome ! the graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful there 's a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it ! the ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours \( not all at once of course \) to solve this mystery it 's a really great buy ! andre	13
1	i absolutely loved this game i could n't stay off my computer it was addicting the game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking it was very entertaining and i would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery i ca n't wait until the next one comes out	13
1	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
1	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
1	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
1	this game is just freakin' awesome im not that big into video games and i really only play them when i have someone to play against i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack then came duty i played this game through on all the difficulty modes from medium up and never got bored plus if you 've got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking multiplayer is sweet \( esp if you break up into teams \) and you can talk smack all day long best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen	13
1	great game higly addictive and gets really tuff once you play on veteran 's mode ! definately a game to have in your collection	13
1	this game is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle one time i was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game only three shots will kill you i had to restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it	13
1	i agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status that being said i spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game well worth the cost and enjoyable i am not familiar with the other civ games and was looking more for a city building game set in the past similar to my favorite game children of the nile perhaps that explains why i was not disappointed	13
1	very good overall graphic voices good sometimes funny sometimes sarcastic pc game should have a readme file that gives maps and walkthroughs	13
1	i love this game ! i love the training exercises being able to compare them with other who creat files on my game and i especially love the sudokus ! ! ! i feel smarter already	13
1	just thought i 'd share my my opinion i think id2 is a great game with a very deep lore great graphics replayability and more if your into rpg games this is right up your alley	13
1	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
1	this game is very good they only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool the game folows the movies well you can even blow up buildings the only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops	13
1	the godfather the game allows you to live the godfather movies the storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well the missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving ! but overall if your a fan of the godfather like i am you wont care \( respect the family !	13
1	i bought this game a bit late \( 2 years after it came out \) but it still seemed state of the art to me ! loved the story and gameplay has improved significantlypros huge map with 5 massave areas to explore tons of vehicles you might not see the same one twice ! cool new features like vehicle customization endless stuff to do ! multiplayer modecons character customization prosess can be annoying if you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back \( ie all your muscle going down \) go buy this game you will really like i	13
1	i like the gta series of games and this one is great too i can turn up my settings to max \( my computer is over a year old \) and there are no problems the kid reviewer claims that he does n't like the n f bomb that is why this is rated m for mature \( so he should not even be playing it \) to give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated this is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions	13
1	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
1	when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com	13
1	had this game on our gamecube so addicting then now we have it on our ds and it is just as much fun only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff you have to get a certain rating i believe like a d nonetheless it is a great game worth the money ! if you have kids the kids will thoroughly enjoy	13
1	if you are a ds owner this game is a must have you will not be disappointed	13
1	what a fun game the graphics are good the stereo sound is awesome there are plenty of tracks and it 's got multi player we 've had a blast with this one high quality fun from nintendo	13
1	i got shrek 2 a couple christmases \( is that right \? \) ago and i gotta say it was alright the pros are that it is up to four players \( so if dad wants to spend quality time with junior \) it has a wide variety of fun characters and plenty of levels however it lacks graphics and young children might not do well during the game but overall its alrightgraphics c it must have been released early cuz it 's pretty badsound b crisp sounds the sound really matches the mood controls a changing and controlling characters' a breezegood for children and adults to	13
1	my just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he ca n't do a very few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy i had to finally defeat for him but he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters it has a tad more killing of stuff than i care for but what does n't these days he likes being able to be different characters his favorite is puss n boots ! as a grown up i enjoyed it as well especially the humor	13
1	the graphics are pretty imbarasing the object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions levels and hero times \( a specific mission were you use one character \) some of the levels are fun like the far far away level \( it has a grand theft auto theme \) i give the graphics a 3 5 \( i think they should have done a better job on the main characters \) audio 4 5 gameplay 4 5 5 fun a 4 5 5 and an overall of 3 5	13
1	the incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being the incredibles even though it is short pros amazing characters great graphics intresting plot footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artworkcons short only 1 playeroverallif you loved the incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well the same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy	13
1	this game is fun to play but not the greatest game either of course the movie is way better than the game the game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels the storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again all in all it 's a good game i would recommend it the graphics are good i do like how they put some storyline in from the movie it 's not to bad of a game to play	13
1	i know how you feel about the incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys violet is just running around invisible elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile was n't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no i in team well you are all by you 're self in this playing one charcter per level please note all movies made into games are ba	13
1	i 've never played real time strategy games before because i primarily play rpg 's this game combines the best elements of both and i 've enjoyed playing it immensly i look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters	13
1	worth the money get lots of hours out of it yet is closr to warcraft civilization style gam	13
1	i have been a staunch final fantasy fan for years while waiting for the newest release which kept being pushed back i tried out xenosaga let me tell you i am grateful i have ! this game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games i have ever played the world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique not to mention a plot that has profound depth you will fall in love trust me if you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours it is xenosaga	13
1	hello all uhh there 's not really much to this card but yeah it keeps you online for another year which is good its 50 bucks for the year long which is very cheap so yeah go out and buy this if your online ps online people add me my 'tag is smiling bob117	13
1	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13
1	this site is the cheapest i have found for this card 60 br 62 do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card 60 br 62 it 's alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year	13
1	i had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as long as you do full charge during the night i was a game watch gameboy psp player but once you start to use this machine you will instantly understand why this game machine became mega hit machine easily i am planning to purchase another one for my younger daughter to let them enjoy communication system with 2 machines	13
1	i bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that i havent been able to play it too often it was taken away from me hehehehehso my review is his and he sais that it deserves five star	13
1	this is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the ps2 for all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research ! i can figure out a way to solve the problem and i'm only 13 ! you are all over 21 ! ar max memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that 's the price for cheating who ever said that cheating would be fair \? overall besides the max memory portion this item is great	13
1	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok i mean it also comes with chrono trigger if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger	13
1	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
1	in the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well but as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it	13
1	my friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh it`s a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	13
1	the e reader is one of the best things that happened to nintendos gba this is so swea	13
1	if you liked the original then you will also like kh2 it finishes the story nicely battle commands are improved i especially like the reaction commands still has some camera issues overall a good game	13
1	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
1	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
1	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
1	in terms of overall quality this game is light years better than tekken 4 the graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature i especially love the customization feature my only problem is playing against jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him other than that this game is terrific	13
1	this is a vary good game one of the best on the ps2 these are my top ten favorite fighters1 \) asuka kazama2 \) christie monteior3 \) ling xiaoyu4 \) kazuya mishima5 \) jin kazama6 \) king7 \) eddy gordo8 \) nina williams9 \) anna williams10 \) devil jinthe only bad thing is jinpachi mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the devilwithin mini game is ok arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you 'll be playing for hours on end later	13
1	i have this monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable \( about 65 for both \) and can say that it 's the best connection you can find for your old xbox however i ca n't really recommend them due to their high prices if you can find the microsoft hd pack get that as it 's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable the only reason i bought this setup was because of their length \( 10 feet \) which can go from one side of my entertainment center \( where the xbox is \) to the other side \( where the stereo receiver is	13
1	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	13
1	monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video they cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping saved 20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days i'm happy	13
1	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13
1	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
1	i would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra	13
1	great tutorial and hands on learning this game is action packed with fight moves jumps combos etc my only complaint was hulk 's reaction time during running but that 's easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff a definate buy	13
1	5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves a must buy for anyone looking for a non stop action game	13
1	this was a present for my brother so i do n't know what it was like but he said it is the best 3rd person game on the x box	13
1	this is the first wireless controller that i have ever used that did n't lag constantly in fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low the range is more than enough for any room in my home actually i have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows great product that i now have two of them and have retired the wired controller	13
1	this is one of the best controller i ever have grip felling and handeled are good as experience i recomende	13
1	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
1	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
1	it 's a very good product but it only can be shipped within u s so i ca n't buy i	13
1	you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub	13
1	i love this game once i started playing i could n't stop my ds battery is dead after like 3 days i play so much once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing you get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time the controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into so lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there mario greatness	13
1	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
1	you get to be different animals it is a really cool game i recommend it to other kids to buy the cheetah get shoot bow and arrows	13
1	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
1	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
1	i love this game for what it is you cannot expect this to be anything like madden but it is still a fun game injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced fast paced something i cannot say about the loading this game is the slowest loading game i have ever played it actually took three minutes for it to load one time get this game provided that you can wait a little bit	13
1	this is an unorthodox football game this is not an nfl game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league there are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom beat the division 3 level move up to 2 beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game as you move up you also unlock rewards if you 're tired of madden 's franchise mode give this game a try it wo n't get outdated just because of nfl free agency	13
1	load time be prepaired to wait ! other then that it 's a fun game that keeps you playing	13
1	for anyone who loves football and everything about it knows their is also a dark side of the game where players take illegal drugs to help out their game where owners will do anything for their team to win this game is alot like any given sunday remember win at any cos	13
1	i love this game it is so much fun even though my wife does not like it i recommend this game for anyone who like mario kart games enjoy the races and do n't forget to blow your friends up	13
1	i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin	13
1	i have been a fan of this game ever since playing against my buddy on my vacation in colorado last year whether you 're interested in pure speed and competative racing or taking your opponents out in road rage it 's all fun ! in addition you can just cause unbelievable mayhem with crash mode where the whole object is to cause as much destruction as possible this game lasts a long time so you have a lot to do it never gets boring i mean there are like 50 cars and trucks waiting for you if you can win them	13
1	i luv this game it is so much fuuuuuuuuuun ! ! ! ! i hate you ppl who say it is stupid i think you are stupid buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	13
1	the ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today the black color is a really nice option too i think it looks much more elegant the only complaint i can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black	13
1	if i had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors i 'd choose the ds now i'm glad i have the option \( i e money \) to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where i could only take one system well you get the idea in a way the ds reminds me of the ps2 it 's a bargain it 's backwards compatible so it plays gba game the games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 you ca n't go wrong	13
1	this title is the tre sequel to railroad tycoon if you loved the old 1990 's original you 'll enjoy this one as well only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited	13
1	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
1	the best set of wireless controllers i have purchased for my xbox system the controllers are nicely fitted for comfortable use and does not cramp up your hands after hours of play connects great and no interruptions while game playing i highly recommend these to anyone that is looking to buy controllers out there they are awesome looking great for playing halo 2 i use it alot with this game and it is the bomb plus my ranking has gone up since using it while playing on xbox live	13
1	i think it 's a great game and you can play online with other people around the world it 's good your 're able to play online because after awhile the easy level gets to be boring there are different levels to keep your intrest the campains are really awsom they never become boreing the mythology in it is real this game is a real high easily gets addictive days of fun	13
1	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
1	the memory card 1019 from nintendo is excellent for saving gamecube saves i used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games and some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them i tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted i have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing i have saved has become corrupted even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like the sims 2 i still have more than enough space left the price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already	13
1	i bought this game used and wish that i could find a dozen more like it i do not like video game violence i do n't want to kill people but i love the whole exploring a world figuring out puzzles angle this game was perfect for that it had attractive graphics an interesting premise and good challenges on the downside it does n't really call out to be replayed once you get through it once which is why it 's better to buy it used \( and why i wish they 'd make a sequel !	13
1	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	13
1	this was a good game that keeps you thinking the story line is that something terrible has happened and you end up being able to go back in time to change events and therefore change the outcome you get to go back to different era 's such as the horse and buggy era and back to modern day there are several endings as well depending on what you 've done you end up playing it through several times to experience the different endings the plot of the story is good and the game has a good pace because time is an issue so you feel like you got to stay on your toes	13
1	another castlevania game means more excitement going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years i love the graphics they are truly something magnificent the special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a castlevania game should be this game follows the formula that was featured in symphony of the night which means if you like the metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well	13
1	this game i purchased for my sons they both told me they enjoyed this game a little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges if you want a game that is not too easy this is the one ! have fun and do n't let losing take the fun away it is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills	13
1	neat game but i should n't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 the 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i'm the 'hero of kavatch' but i do n't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently does n't entitle me to even pick up an item if i do n't own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic	13
1	this is a well done game especially if you liked the movie characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there 's a cute storyline to the game there are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next there 's a pretty small age window that its good for i 'd say about 6 to 10 under 6 the stages are too hard over 10 they 're sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly it would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it 's still well done and worth buying	13
1	many games my kids have are n't actually geared towards kids this game is perfect for children it 's fun without being too hard or easy my children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained i highly recommend this as a great family game many games we can take turns playing	13
1	this works great for charging both my ds lite and classic ds from usb i also like the included keychain flashlight it 's kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger but it 's quite bright and handy to have anyways i'm not sure why the previous reviewer says that it does n't fit the ds lite it does perfectly perhaps she is trying to use the gba micro adapter that is included \? you do n't need to the adapter is only to charge classic ds gba or gba micro the cable itself is all you need to charge ds lite	13
1	madden comes out again but with some stupid lead blocking controls i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls y cant they come out with something good	13
1	i find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see however my major disappointment comes from the graphics i understand the ps2 does n't not have the standards of the xbox360 but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for i just hope when the ps3 comes out madden will rerelease the game for it to give the xbox360 owners something to whine about ea should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have	13
1	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
1	i bought this game a couple months ago and i absolutely love it ! i am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will love ths ! it 's great excerise and very challenging with cool music it 's like ddr only with your hands try it i promise you 'll have a great time i could play it all day	13
1	if you already have an eye toy and your favorite game on it is beat freak then you have to get eye toy groove the 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from elvis to good charlotte as a 46 year old woman i got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in this is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 even the preschoolers i occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than i can say for dance dance revolution	13
1	my daughter got the eye toy for her birthday and we recently added the dance groove game to the collection she and her friends \( 10 yrs of age \) really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids she says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera	13
1	when i went online looking at reviews i started to get rather edgy about buying this game but omg ! this is a great game sure it is n't the best ff game out there but it is definately one of the better gun games out there sometimes the graphics get rather distorted but i think that the a graphics in the middle of the game really make up for it i'm glad that vincent finally gets his own game in short you people who hate this game are wierd	13
1	i bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact i have n't heard any noise he is to busy playing it	13
1	my 9 year old and 16 year old fight over this game my 9 year old owns the game she has asked me to buy her 16 year old sister the game so she will leave hers alone it is a great game that will hold your attention	13
1	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
1	hi i am 11 yrs old and my next door neighboor 's little sister got a pink nintendo lite she is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday with the nintendo ds lite she recieved cooking mama i started to play it and it was really fun ! it is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food my favorite is making the pizza and beef stew	13
1	i just got this game last night and i am amazed ea sports really delivered with this one the race for the heisman mode is simply amazing all the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing the game is probably the best football game i have ever played definately a must have for any football fan	13
1	this game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities you can even go the wrong way for me \( older adult \) it was fun to play with my kids but i found it repetitive and boring after a while of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game	13
1	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
1	this is the original playstation controller and it is the best it feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy if you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling i strongly reccommend do not buy the big mad catz controller it does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks just stick with the sony controler it is the best of the best	13
1	gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 xbox and ps2 's controllers have buttons that are the same size it 's really confusing really on gamecube 's you know the a buttons the big one b 's the small one and x and y are the kidney shaped ones hard to tell them apart right	13
1	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
1	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
1	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
1	ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular fps \( first person shooter \) games out there ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that i know still play cs today like myself from planting bombs to rescuing hostages you 'll find this game enjoyable there are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 the screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers if your looking for a great fps game this is it	13
1	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
1	this game is great for when you have a group of friends come over it really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining i suggest this game for everybody	13
1	i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it 's definitely for all ages even my two year old ca n't get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes	13
1	when i first started playing fable i was amazed how much possibility there was to forge your own destiny where one simple decision could alter your destiny for good or evil forever when you start out as a young boy who 's village is burned plundered and the entire town murdered you feel sorry for the boy as his life has been taken from him from then on he is to become a hero as you embark on a long journey and make choices along the way you will forge you own personal destiny with a well written storyline to back it up this game amplifies your freedom to forge your destiny	13
1	of all the karaoke games we have used this is by far the best it 's fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters it has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have there are the are different options like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score hours of fun fun fun ! !	13
1	for the price is a good deal i only use one card i have the other one for backup nice product good pric	13
1	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
1	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
1	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
1	they 're nice cards i never had a problem since i had 3 ps2s in my house at the time we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine then my boyfriend bought me these and i always had my own memory cards no one else could say they were theirs or anything else the only problem i can think of is that they are a little expensive	13
1	my 9 year old daughter loves ps2 so buying the cards were worth the cost	13
1	as you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect ! by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same !	13
1	beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the valkyrie epic the storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists valkyrie profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the ps2 making it a must buy on a personal note this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so i highly recommend playing vp1 through before starting vp2	13
1	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok	13
1	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
1	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
1	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
1	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
1	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
1	i 'd recommend this to anyone who has or ever will play a video game in their life i also recommend it to those that never will it 's just plain awesome	13
1	this headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear the big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use wearing the halo 2 headset i actually forgot that i was even wearing it because it is so light they have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price i greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	13
1	this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you 'd be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks chris	13
1	this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great	13
1	this was a top notch game i really enjoyed playing it it was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter the good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly \( especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time i was \) if you 've already played halo and you 're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	13
1	mechassault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine destroying other mechs and tanks as well but when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again \? no not if you have xbox live in live you can play capture the flag download new mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more if you do n't have xbox live or a system link that your wasting your money	13
1	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
1	this is one awesome game play it online or against the computer i do suggest online for more fun in the long run if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume definetely the scariest first person shooter out there	13
1	blinx can be very time consuming for us older xbox players \( whom did n't grow up with a controller in our hands \) i found blinx to be fun entertaining and challenging even though it is rated for younger children i think the strategy involved is for older children teenagers and some of us adults for anyone wishing to have some fun have to think a bit blinx is for you	13
1	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
1	i ordered this set primarily for lotr return of the king but after i got it it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it but i was able to play the other three games and i really enjoyed freedom fighters and medal of honor black and white was okay but i was n't able to get into it but it should be noted that with black and white you get both the original game and the expansion pack creature isle so you are really getting five games instead of four so i highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good but not so modern games and spend little money	13
1	i have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w the game i liked the stage where you can get on to the great wall of china \( i think thats what it is \) and my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8 10 ! he said it could go up if he played more the controls are so easy and fun ! ! ! i highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii	13
1	a lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good but it is my favorite game to play on the wii doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun and you get bonus points for ramming your opponents if it were only like that on real roads	13
1	i picked this up along with zelda when buying the wii this game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is so fun ! i love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road the action is fast and the driving is very intuitive \( provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts \) it 's not too hard anyone can play and it 's just fun i love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me highly recommended do n't overlook this game !	13
1	one of the best ds games i ever had it does not take to be a lawyer to get fully satisfied with this game although this is a heavily text based game \( i mean really heavy ! \) you wo n't get tired of reading the storylines and following the details i know you wo n't find this in any stores nowadays so try to order here at amazon this game 's one of the best	13
1	i ordered this game based on reviews alone it 's great ! will not disappoint the only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected other than that a great game hope to see a sequel	13
1	nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price	13
1	ok i 've had this controller for 3 years and nothing happend to it it has fallen maney times and nothing happend some kid wrotethat it 's a rip off for 24 bucks ! ! well thats the best deal you 'll get it 's way better than the stupid bulky xbox controllers xbox may have better grathics but the games stink and xbox 's can catch on fire	13
1	the continuation of the sims2 game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack the smaller expansions in between the big ones ie glamour life stuff and or holiday mini pack are good in my book because i get tired of the same decor and clothing after a while it 's nice to get fresh things although ea could just bundle those small expansions in with one of the bigger ones like sims2 nightlife or sims2 pets for examples regardless i still love the sims2 and i look forward to more enhancements in the future	13
1	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
1	the xbox version of this game is way better for one the graphics are enhanced not crappy like the ps2 version and second of all loading time and processing time is is literally cut in half so dont buy this version suck it up and buy an xbox oh and if this game bores you you either were n't using cheats or u havent played the missions atleast throughlos santos	13
1	basically if you like 04 05 and 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics i like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it this is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge	13
1	no other game looks or plays like this the missions and locations are varied and colorful the villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials and as usual rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating lots of unlockables offer high replay this is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period i still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru the story is straightforward and engaging lots of really interesting concepts \( machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole 'dead eye' thing \) and it controls very well another great game from an outstanding company hopefully a sequel is in the works	13
1	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west i try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is awesome i cant wait for the new western game gun coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme \) that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying	13
1	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
1	very good stealth type game this game is really addicting and keeps you playing its a really intense game and gets harder level by level one of them games where it makes you think you gotta think what your next move should be like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it should you take them out \? or sneak past them \? alot of stuff like that hands down a really fun game	13
1	this is a pretty decent looking diablo style rpg game that adds another chapter to the game sacred in underworld you explore more areas farther north in the world of ancaria i found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore rather difficult and a little confusing but there are interesting new quests and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters the dwarf and demoness the original sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the underworld epansion pack	13
1	i bought this after it had been out a year so not as much available on line as there was a year ago also it is a german game so limited usa playing but i loved the first sacred i also loved sacred underworld if you do n't plan on on line playing sacred is worth the money	13
1	as the title suggests sacred underworld is pretty much the same as sacred but a little better so if you like sacred sacred underworld is very well worth playing	13
1	as far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive some can be had for 40 50 at other sites but those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space this adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that it connects to the back of the console \( and hd dvd drive if you purchase that \) and use the power of the 360 it does n't take up any extra space and has a strong connection i would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home	13
1	all i had to do was plug it into the console and bring up xbox live and it connected the only thing i did not like is that i would have preferred an ethernet connection in lieu of the usb connection other than that the product worked as intended	13
1	when i first heard of this game i basically ignored it then when i was visiting gamestop one day i decided to buy it i was instantly amazed by the unique battle system the bright and cheerful backdrops \( except for twilight town that is \) and the challenging and profound gameplay i have not played the first one but i will probably get it from the virtual console on wii one problem with the game is that it 's too short	13
1	i 've been playing mario games since the original debut on the nes and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game the rpg style is a great offshoot for the mario franchise the dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30 hours i spent playing the game were well worth it there 's a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find i will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over	13
1	i am an old lady trying to play a kids' game i aprreciate the fact that this game explains the moves to me very clearly i have enjoyed playing it and so have my grandchildren i am very glad i purchased it	13
1	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
1	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13
1	this game is really good ! i have a real up to date computer so everything runs fast and smooth the multiplayer is great ! you can play 1 000 's of people in a huge number of maps and game styles you can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear ! one of the down points is that in multilayer someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing another thing would be the lag this is where the game moves real choppy or you lose the network connection still its a really fun game	13
1	this game is amazing unlike so many other star wars games this is a first person shooter which is a great touch to the star wars universe i found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle the coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons you have attachments to one gun the attachments are sniper and rocket launcher the single player campaign is outstanding though the multiplayer is so so this game is simply a terrific star wars title	13
1	this game is very goodit jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don	13
1	excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar	13
1	its gran turismo theres really nothing more to say i own all the titles in this franchise and i have never been disappointed with any one of em the series is really amazing with every new release it only gets better people should also try tourist trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing	13
1	this is the most complete and most interesting racing game ever developed in the history of video games the best graphics the most cars the precise handling and did i mention the graphics wow this is amazing playing this game makes me wonder what would the next one will look like how can sony make anything that's better than this \? it is already the best racing game in the world it is simply amazing no other game could ever come close gran turismo has always been immitated but never duplicated a five out of five	13
1	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
1	we just got a ps2 after having no game system at all since the old atari i had when i was 13 so learning all the quot new fangled quot controls is a bit tricky starsky and hutch as well as being a fun game is straight forward enough that the learning curve was easy and enabled me to get right into the action without having to die a thousand times just to learn how to maneouvre as i get better with the controller the game is still proving to be fun and challenging without being frustrating	13
1	cicken little is a fantastic game this game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting sports unioform hunt and more the best part i like is the carpool craze	13
1	i guess this is a good buy especially when corporate vice president and chief xna architect of microsoft says so i just thought it was interesting when j allard gave a review of this product on amazon co	13
1	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	13
1	this is the kit not just a card a previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 that is not correct they are selling the card for 49 99 this kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly it does what it intends to do	13
1	the game has a lot of plot development and cutscenes if you are into it then that 's great i find i scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue that being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen i find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is the action is good and the plot does suck you in nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it 's predecessors completely worth your while	13
1	for newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it however if you 've already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable a few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore the story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game so if you 've been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you i however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line	13
1	with the wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one some preordered it while some others \( including me \) are camping out for it but some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction sure sideways wii controllers are s nes controllers but what of gamecubes \? i am happy to say that i have gotten a chance to play around with the wii before anyone else and yes the wavebird receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the wii it looks pefectly at home there rejoice gamers ! pick up your wavebirds and play on	13
1	the bottom of the controller sticks out quite a bit but this does not affect gameplay and other than that it is the same size as the regular gamecube controller simply fantastic \( unless you 're one of those people that just need to have rumble for some reason \) but one slight problem is it just me or do the trigger buttons occasionally fail \? for example in resident evil 4 i 'll be holding the r button to aim but it will quickly go back and forth from normal view as if the button cancels out however this is rare and maybe it 's just me once again an excellent high quality controller	13
1	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
1	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
1	the gta series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created	13
1	awesome game loads of fun all a guy needs women money cars power \( not necessarily in that order \)	13
1	i loved the game the characers are great the worlds are interesting it still deosnt look outdated and the combat is fairly strategic unfortuneatley the games ending is rather lack luster	13
1	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
1	i 've read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the ps3 since the ps3 originally only comes with the traditional wires \( av cables \) im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal \( hd pic quality \) or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones	13
1	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
1	very good cable get it if you have a ps2 and a component input on your tv much better picture than composite cables	13
1	these component av cables make a world of difference in video quality especially on hdtv some images now appear pixelated this may be the game i am playing but everything else is smooth crisp and clear text is three times as easy to read i reccomend these for any hdtv owner	13
1	i was very eager to get this title on import knowing that it was somewhat 'unique' in terms of it 's genre label yes it has rpg elements but it 's something quite separate i only wish there were more such games on the ps2 or any format for that matter this is storytelling videogame style at it 's best capcom clover have produced a real gem it 's an experience like zelda a highly enjoyable slice of fantasy that is sure to hold you in it 's thrall for some 50 hours or more a visual treat and beautiful soundtrack also if you consider yourself a gamer then get this it 's destined for cult status in a word superb	13
1	i bought this game on ps2 for my daughter who is 12 and she has had a ball playing it though there are english subtitles because it is spoken in very fast japanese that does n't take away from the game 's adventures the instructions given are very clear and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks it really is quite enjoyabl	13
1	i will keep this review short the game is a very addictive entertaining rpg great story great gameplay best game i played all year only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies took me about 45 hours to complete the main story and almost all of the side missions if you buy this game you will play it to the end	13
1	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
1	besides baldur 's gate ii icewide dale is the second most fun crpg game out there more action than role playing which is fine with me this is a single player multi character game and you get to create the entire party of 6 adventures the plot is fairly weak but the action is plentiful and i love the fact that you get to develop 6 different characters if you have to get just one of the icewind dale games get icewind dale ii the character generation and development is much better \( not to mention the gameplay and graphics \)	13
1	pros 1 character creation is fun detailed and basically unmatched by any game on the market much better than the nwn creation system 2 graphic is beautiful but if you are expecting fully 3d environment you will be disappointed 3 music is just awesome 4 did i mention character creation is fun ! playing your custom made party is a very satisfying experience any kind of team is playable you can solo the game too if you like cons 1 does not feature 3d environment like nwn2 gameplay is linear but i did n't care as the point of my game is to develope my character	13
1	if you enjoy the series you will love the game as simple as that very entertaining do n't miss it	13
1	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
1	you know what \? i absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard i beat it on normal in one week ! and this was when it first came out when i was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen but anyway this game was so fun ! i got it the week it came out and that christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it i have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old	13
1	graphically this game is a work of art the shiny surfaces glowing lightsabers and vibrant colors make this a winner as far as gameplay those you can even forget the graphics ! this gameplay is so good you could play it with terrible graphics and still have an aweseome time ! the score by john williams is another highlight the music enhances the tension action and drama of this game overall this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played	13
1	and three years later i buy the game wow ! awesome ! i ca n't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release ! everything looks and feels great on my xp this is one of the only games i have purchased and and not had to return due to the cd being messed up or some corrupted file so i'm happy ! i thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on yep this is a game i would suggest to any gamer	13
1	this is one of the best racing games i have ever played you can do so many modifications to your car	13
1	all of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy tv 's i mean it could be that i have a 20 inch sony trinitron and the halo special edition xbox too but i have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends \( in real life \) or anyone in my counterstrike clan \( on xbox live \) that have old tv 's and regular xboxesreccomendation if the picture is crappy buy a new tv	13
1	this is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging do n't listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard the people who claim it 's to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get 's to the point where you want to throw the game out the window this is a good game and i highly recomend it to and star wars fan p s do n't buy jedi academy that game is horrible ! what a shame to ruin the series like that	13
1	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
1	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
1	what can you say for katamari damcy except for it 's exciting original fun edgy ! i totally recommend this for any video game fan that love games on the edge of something different new ! p s do n't delete this game when you are done because you will need to convert your progress to we love katamari	13
1	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
1	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
1	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
1	one of the more interesting video game ideas that i 've seen in a long time the japanimation style is very cool and the gameplay is very engrossing using the stylus pen to perform medical procedures is shockingly addictive and frequently very challenging	13
1	i bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds the beginning went well the operations are fun the story drags a little and goes too slow i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations the operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful i am stuck on the 6th one i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now but continuously fail unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further	13
1	quite simply it 's great though a bit on the challenging side gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it 's 'rated 'e' for everyone' approach will appeal to adults as well as kids it 's not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list if you like adventure titles like phoenix wright and trace memory \( or maniac mansion for that matter \) then you 'll really dig this game a good solid four stars	13
1	this is a fun game to play i am on the 2nd mystery to solve i do love these types of games this one is sort of like trace memory alot of reading to do in it i am an adult woman my 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though	13
1	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
1	this is my first introduction to the wolrd of gta and i loved it ! i 've played gta 3 but it was not as fun as vice city due to the voice actors included in the game which gives the game life i was n't a very big fan of american music \( since i only listen to japanese \) but this game made me like them bit by bit even though it has some glitches in the game i still prefer this over all gta series	13
1	this product is excellent has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time good perfromanc	13
1	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
1	i love this game ! it 's not too hard for kids to play \( my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets \) and it 's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it 's also cool so us adults can play as well ! i love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like jesse james and the jester etc the graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also	13
1	whatever product sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a top quality product and these sony memory card for ps2 is just the perfect exampl	13
1	this product arrived quickly and in excellent shape thanks for being a quality shop this product is hard to find in a store thanks again	13
1	this is a nice package of my two favorite final fantasy games final fantasy vi and final fantasy v final fantasy v has never seen release here and i feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original japanese version final fantasy vi has been restored to its original glory in this version and it 's a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original final fantasy vi title with tina \( terra \) in magitek armor i highly recommend this collection	13
1	i love this game i had it for snes and it is one of my favorite	13
1	best fighting game i have played in a long time the characters are coo	13
1	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
1	i have played several nancy drew games and this is by far the best one i recommend this game to anyone	13
1	this is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game this game works with xp however you need to have a combo drive that includes dvd writer c d combo writer i have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly	13
1	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
1	i dont know what everyone else 's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome ! the graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful there 's a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it ! the ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours \( not all at once of course \) to solve this mystery it 's a really great buy ! andre	13
1	i really liked this game im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game all the time i dont why i would buy it if i were you ! ! ! very fun challenging at the same time !	13
1	this game took my 9 year old son 2 days to complete it was a disappointment since i paid 30 for it but the action adventure games make younger kids to make wiser decisions overall this game deserves an a not an adult type game but fun for kids	13
1	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
1	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
1	my husband brought this game home and i thought oh no i guess we 're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks but to my surprise not only did he absolutely love this game but i would sit next to him and watch totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game i caught myself saying baby are n't you going to play your game \? this game is incredible and while i am not at all a gamer i'm tempted to try it out ! everyone not shocked by gore \( and i mean lots of gore \) should play this game every game should be this well made	13
1	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
1	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
1	king 's quest games are classic but why are they not including king 's quest 8 mask of eternity \? i know that it was not well received when it came out \( i personally liked it \) but just because it was not well received they wo n't include it it 's part of the series and should be included as well	13
1	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
1	this is a great game in which yoiu get caught up in the action it 's almost as if you are there	13
1	i really love this game i'm not much of a gamer but i really enjoying playing this one both by myself or in multi player mode	13
1	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
1	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
1	i bought 2 of these controllers for my kids because i did n't want cables in the middle of our family room nor did i want them sitting too close to the tv when they played this controllers are excellent they work perfectly they are easy to store because of the lack of cables the weight is fine for small children the range of the signal is more than enough and they are n't battery eaters i use them as well and they are wonderful they are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations	13
1	my son loves this controller it fits well in his hands and has a similar feel to the regular corded ps2 sony controller it does n't have the same rumble feature but has a button to turn the rumble feature on and off overall it 's the best cordless that he 's used yet	13
1	the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin	13
1	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
1	hi tried ordering g2 gold edition online but it wo n't let me and the retailers here do n't have it in their data even so my only options are to get somweone i know in the states to get it for me or to go there myself and try to get it gothic 2 gold edition night of the raven thats the one email me anyone who knows how to get this to me here in victoria bc alan johnson chumtv com or alj2663 hotmail comthanks a bunc	13
1	make no mistake about it this game has more than a few bugs and sudden desktop crashes it is also one of the most immersive and totally enjoyable games i have ever played i am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds if not thousands of video games since the 70 's this game has it all as far as role playing games go one bit of advice about this game is save often save often save often oh and one more thing be sure to save often	13
1	this game rocks you 've got action storytelling quests your own path linear gameplay and the world is alive people have jobs and work times and play times the controls are a little quirky but worth the hassle	13
1	i found this to be a fun game as well as effective i enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and abilty to increase my speed i particularly like it when it got to the level where i could choose which games i wanted to use for my brain age tests several of the games are going to require more repetitions before i become skillful at them i find that i continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest carole adan	13
1	i baught this game because i was hopping for a good multiplayer first person shooter for the wii but this was not the case the multipler is crap it is jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 i am more prone to multi player games like time splitters where you can all be on a time so i was pretty dissapointed the story is great though it really takes advantage of the wii mote and has a great storyline ! ! i jsut wish it had a better multiplayer	13
1	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
1	this game is great both the missions and the things you do on your own \( like extortion \) make this game an awesome part of anyone 's collection i only found one thing wrong with the game when you reach the rank of don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel for instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble this game although great can still use a little fine tuning	13
1	this game is very good they only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool the game folows the movies well you can even blow up buildings the only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops	13
1	i bought this game a bit late \( 2 years after it came out \) but it still seemed state of the art to me ! loved the story and gameplay has improved significantlypros huge map with 5 massave areas to explore tons of vehicles you might not see the same one twice ! cool new features like vehicle customization endless stuff to do ! multiplayer modecons character customization prosess can be annoying if you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back \( ie all your muscle going down \) go buy this game you will really like i	13
1	fyi if you enjoy modding to spice up your gta world and enhance replayability you do not want to buy ver 2 0 ! ! ! due to lawsuits over the hot coffee mod ver 2 0 was released with new code that prevents any mods from working if you want to replace the banshee with the new ferrari superamerica or the landstalker with an h2 you need ver 1 0 if you do n't care about modding then sit back and enjoy the ride	13
1	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
1	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	13
1	i know how you feel about the incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys violet is just running around invisible elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile was n't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no i in team well you are all by you 're self in this playing one charcter per level please note all movies made into games are ba	13
1	this is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer i love mine	13
1	unfortunately xenosaga i der wille zur macht is never come to europe but as the second xenosaga \( jenseits von gut und b se \) was released in germany in november i was very happy so i played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay ! i became a big xenosaga fan after that i imported the first part of the series from america now i am playing it and i must say that the first xenosaga is much better than the second ! ! ! ! it 's a great pity that xenosaga episode i never will be brought out in germany and europa ! ! you americans should be very happy that so many rpgs come to your country	13
1	i'm enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when i received it i have n't had the chance to play as much as i 'd like but i will	13
1	do n't listen to the other reviewers this game is great by far beats out sim city 4 \( and i have that game \) it 's challenging to make everybody happy but if the game was easy it would n't be fun	13
1	i have owned the first ds since the day it came out i bought the ds lite about a week after it came out and i was amazed of the changes it is so much lighter and is just a lot better to have than the original the screen emits about as much light as the sun it is like dlp technology compared to a regular tv plus most of the games look loads better sme people say there is a stress crack but i have had mine since june and it is still in very good condition my advice is to you to buy this ds lite and you will have made a good choice	13
1	this is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the ps2 for all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research ! i can figure out a way to solve the problem and i'm only 13 ! you are all over 21 ! ar max memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that 's the price for cheating who ever said that cheating would be fair \? overall besides the max memory portion this item is great	13
1	this is one of the best games i have ever played anyone who is sceptical just needs to pick a controller and go you wo n't be dissappointed	13
1	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
1	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
1	you already knew it was a good game becuase it 's final fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games this one is probably a little worse than the best final fantasy games \( such as iii and vii \) but despite that what you have here is a game boy advance rpg that has graphics that actually are n't that bad and the storyline is pretty good too you just ca n't go wrong with final fantasy games	13
1	i am a fan of arena football i enjoy watching it because it is exciting but this game does n't live up to the real game the game is very similiar to nfl blitz except nfl blitz is better what makes unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass the most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up if you are thinking of buying this game rent it first to see if it is really worth the money	13

1	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
1	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
1	no this game is n't perfect you 'll be annoyed by the dialogue \( luckily you can fast forward through it \) and the cut scenes \( unfortunately you can't fast forward through those \) but it 's filled with tons of things to solve and if you get stuck you can have the game solve it for you this game will keep you busy for a while but fair warning it 's corny	13
1	this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice	13
1	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	13
1	without this memory card there is no fun when you 're playing a game for a few hours and get really far you will definitely wanna save it without the memory card you will have to do everything all over again with the memory card you can save up and continue playing later really that 's all the information you need pick it up today	13
1	this memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced i did n't have to worry about this because mine came with my ps2 it can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game if you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng	13
1	ok first of all i think these are too expensive if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting ive never had any problems with these so yeah there ya go buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money	13
1	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
1	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
1	halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time this is definately a good game to play if you 've never played a first person shooter also if you have an xbox you should get this because it is awesome ratingsgraphics then 10 now 7sound 10replayability 6controls 10drawn in atmosphere 9fun 9multiplayer co op 9 multiplay	13
1	this is an excellent game people who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game	13
1	my children enjoy being able to play gameboy games together now with the adaptor	13
1	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
1	amazing how far computers have come since my old c64 was classified as a powerful machine graphically i love the new stuff but once in awhile its nice to backtrack to the good ol days of 64k memory and 5 1 4 disk drives i agree with the review about the difficulty of the games but its just once again a reminder of the changes in gaming with the times my old c64 eventually burnt up with use and its nice to see i'm not the only one to miss these game treasures included on this wonderful piece of equipment now if only somebody would do this with an apple ii	13
1	the 30 in 1 sold thru amazon is a real commodore 64 computer on a single ship the ntsc version 1 board has 128kb ram and a 2mb rom inside the case of the d2tv there are solder pads that will allow anyone who can solder to attach connectors for the iec serial buss a ps2 keyboard and in some cases a second joystick and some of the wires for the user port product identificationversion 1 comes in a pyramid shapped box has 128kb ram 2mb romversion 2 comes in a hexagon shapped box has 2mb ram 2mb flashversion 3 boards are in a game called hummer of road racing	13
1	brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	13
1	i have this monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable \( about 65 for both \) and can say that it 's the best connection you can find for your old xbox however i ca n't really recommend them due to their high prices if you can find the microsoft hd pack get that as it 's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable the only reason i bought this setup was because of their length \( 10 feet \) which can go from one side of my entertainment center \( where the xbox is \) to the other side \( where the stereo receiver is	13
1	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	13
1	it works great great quality great sound and especially great color detail only thing that sucks is actually getting the cables into the tv plugs it 's horrible on most tv 's i 've seen with component plugs the plugs are are built very close together and each of the component ends \( blue green red \) where the cap kind of goes over actual thing you put in \( the usually gold plated thing \) are almost too big so you ca n't fully plug in all 5 of them \( 3 video 2 audio \) but just kinda have to push em in just enough so that it actually works other than that the quality and everything is fantasti	13
1	i could care less what it does for the original xbox what i'm into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer xbox save files over to xbox 360 now i wo n't have to start halo all over	13
1	i also am a huge monkey ball fan and also own them all and this one is just as good as not better than the others game play is awsome with the new control system and as for the old target game their are a few target games on this one if you dont like monkey target then try paraglider for a much harder and funner game this games has so many games that are fun with friends of all ages snowboarding a few racing disk golf free throw hovercraft battle boxer bowling fencing sling shot and so many more	13
1	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13
1	this game was a lot of fun the microphone headset works great the only downside is i wish it had more songs but i guess that is what sequals are for overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself	13
1	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
1	this is the best jak game in the series the handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur the game is not easy which is good graphics are good as well if you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game overall i give this game a perfect 10	13
1	when i upgraded to the 360 i was a bit saddened that i would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing first wireless no tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also \( although i'm sure they 're on the wired controllers \) quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch	13
1	needs more shoulder buttons other than that is good	13
1	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
1	there is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than dungeons and dragons and that is star wars this game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things it is a flawless game	13
1	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
1	when it comes to the gc gba cable you wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games but it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing depending on the game and what features it opens up plus it is cheap to get and once you 've gotten this wonderful item you will wonder why you didnt get it sooner i know from my own experience	13
1	this cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy player on final fantas	13
1	i have n't finished this game though i'm quite close to it i have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that i 've had in a long time i laughed out loud more than a few times was nearly constantly smiling and was thoroughly amused with all the little details not much stylus action but then again did you really expect there to be \? my boyfriend 's highly considering getting a ds lite simply so he can play this game	13
1	i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics did n't annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba it 's kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpg 's like this it 's short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot ! it 's a lovely game	13
1	i'm so glad i listened to the fine reviewers on amazon and bought this game it was worth every penny and then some ! ! it has a lot of really great game play and i love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks i feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters you would n't feel right about mario and luigi casting spells like the characters from final fantasy but it 's perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells and as weird as that sounds it makes for a great rpg lots of good side missions too like collecting the beans wonderful game !	13
1	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
1	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
1	rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games	13
1	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13
1	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
1	i ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store little did i know that i actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here he loves it ! he actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well ! it was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own we are very pleased with this purchase	13
1	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
1	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
1	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
1	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
1	this communicator is the best i have ever used i own a game center andplay video games for extended amounts of time it remains comfortable tha phoeni	13
1	headset is awesome fits very snug on your ear and does not irritate over time has crystal clear 2 4ghz channel 9 hours of game time and only takes at the most 1 5 hours to charge gaming is a lot more fun !	13
1	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
1	first things first there is a mute button on this unit if a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off i'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either did n't read the instructions or could n't figure out a product with three buttons on it \( power mute volume up and volume down \) second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a logitech wireless controller it works well and i noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular xbox communicator	13
1	pros 1 \) wireless2 \) small3 \) lightweight4 \) you can talk to your friends when you 're in the bathroom 5 \) it has a lot of noises to tell you it 's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max cons 1 \) cliking and poping noises2 \) my charger does n't connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 \) there is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 \) have to charge it why ca n't it just have a fuel cell \? 5 \) no mute statis or indicator 6 \) it makes poping noises and a white nois	13
1	i love this game it is so much fun even though my wife does not like it i recommend this game for anyone who like mario kart games enjoy the races and do n't forget to blow your friends up	13
1	this is the best game ever ! if you want to play with your love ones this is the best game to have with you can be addicted to it sometimes but that 's a good sign for a good gam	13
1	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
1	this game is the best i have ever gotten i 've got in pin the tail on the ed but i ca n't seem to get pass the hard parts also this game deserves an oscar ! !	13
1	i rented this game before i bought and liked it so much i just had too buy it	13
1	after playing this game for 16 days \( i finally finished it after 91 hours of game play \) i now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards it is just that good ! try not to breeze your way right through it though or you 'll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience take your time and enjoy it not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy this game requires you to think befor you do things it really is a fun game to play and overall that 's what playing games are all about having fun !	13
1	the ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today the black color is a really nice option too i think it looks much more elegant the only complaint i can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black	13
1	i bought the white one for my 7 year old son but could never tear it away from his hands so i got my own too bad they have n't invented a calendar appointment software for us big kids the only negative is the white one gets dirty very easily would recommend buying the black instead	13
1	i love this thing it 's awesome the older version of ds was a little clunky and childish looking this thing rocks my socks off ! it 's sleek sexy and portable it 's like an ipod of video games you do n't have to buy batteries it comes with an extra stylus its screen is brighter the sound is stereo ! this thing is super dope ! it 's the freshest thing out there ! you gotta get one sell your old ds on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one you 'll love it	13
1	this title is the tre sequel to railroad tycoon if you loved the old 1990 's original you 'll enjoy this one as well only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited	13
1	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
1	the best set of wireless controllers i have purchased for my xbox system the controllers are nicely fitted for comfortable use and does not cramp up your hands after hours of play connects great and no interruptions while game playing i highly recommend these to anyone that is looking to buy controllers out there they are awesome looking great for playing halo 2 i use it alot with this game and it is the bomb plus my ranking has gone up since using it while playing on xbox live	13
1	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
1	a great improvment on an excellent game only disappointment is that you ca n't access the same titans from the campaign in the quick game and that the titans are n't named i think that they should be afterall they are gods i 'd also like to see a patch that gives you access the the norse giant hero he was pretty cool but the roles of the heros are great and the atlantean army is awesome	13
1	i bought this for my 15 year old son for christmas he loves it and he 's got me hooked the game is everything they say and more ! you will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like ! the only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered	13
1	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
1	i have this memory card and nyko 's version of the same thing and this one is much more reliable i 've had it filled up nearly to the top with 950 blocks used out of the 1019 avaliable and it never lost or corrupted any of the data great for madden football owners since it takes like 165 blocks of memory to save a franchise	13
1	i bought this memory for my kids since hey were advancing in video playing and were n't able to save their achievements this memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels i think is the best out there	13
1	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	13
1	what makes it special is that it 's the first playstation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device i gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive ps2 game \( 2 or 3 hours ! \) on the other hand there are several possible endings and a bonus game the game has a nostalgic atmosphere and the graphics are astonishing	13
1	with nintendo riding very high on the handheld gaming market with the game boy advance they 've also shown their stuff with the success of the nintendo ds as well and a newer recently redesigned version of the ds called the ds lite these stylus pens are specifically for the nintendo ds lite only and work very well for all gamers they are simple to control and play around with for games like magnetica new super mario bros tetris ds and many others the control of these pens are easy to use and handle for all gamers this is a absolute must for ds lite owners price aconvience aoverall	13
1	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
1	i very much enjoyed this game and i think it may be my favorite x box game i own ! i kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better ! one funny part about this game is the part where you are sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable	13
1	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
1	this game is alot like call of duty 2 the graphics are better than 2 the play is almost the same the online play is where the game thrives the online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game if you love shooters you will love this game	13
0	expensive and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time after getting up from nights sleep i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again	14
0	meditation will do the same thing buy a tape or take a class	14
0	when i got this pedometer i found that the instructions were n't clear i never did get the thing to work i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate this one was n't the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost it 's just easier to buy a new one however i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store	14
0	this oregon scientific pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price there is no point to even considering saving money when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary	14
0	this pedometer is so much cheaper \( 7 \) than the typical decent ones \( that go for about 18 20 \) now i know it is for a reason the buttons are flimsy the package looks very cheap the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen did not work also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device terrible ergonomics form factor would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron oregon sc 18 pedometers much better form factor high reliability and quality	14
0	the monitor works really well the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking if you are looking for a good basic monitor this is a great unit	14
0	i do n't know how this works because when i found that i would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work i returned it it is n't evident in the advert for this \( or any other \) heart rate monitor i guess i 'll have to trust my sense of pain	14
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal do not buy this product	14
0	after using this product for about a month and a half i began to get very high blood pressure readings \( 157 106 \) my doctor took my bp on the same day and got 130 80 which i also got with my manual cuff i find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well the only good thing about it is that you do n't have to record your readings manually if they calibrate the machine properly it would be a great thing but i wasted my money	14
0	be sure to measure your arm before purchasing it 's annoying to receive the unit with the standard adult arm cuff \( fits arms 9 to 13 inches around \) and find out i have to order a larger arm cuff ! do n't bother calling omron customer service at 1 800 634 4350 just a typical big company voice mail hell ! it even tells you to call another number to order the piece my 1 star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and omrons customer service	14
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them i wish i had known this before now i have to waste about 20 in shipping to return it do not buy for body fat measurement	14
0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
0	frankly suggest not to buy will regret a lot after buying ooooo aaaa ouchhhh tooo painful and hair starts growing in a weeek and taking very loooooooooooooong timeee to finish one hand dont buy	14
0	amazon and this company are nightmares i ordered this scale a month ago and the expected ship date keeps changing i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever he was no help at all after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade all he was able to give me was the ship date range which has already changed several times amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time	14
0	ordered this item on sept 28 they were supposed to ship it within 1 week after 1 week i received an email they said they needed 2 more weeks another email today \( nov 7 \) they think they can deliver it by november 27 that 's 2 months after i placed my order at this point i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year fortunately with amazon they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order which is what i am going to do right now	14
0	stay away from this seller salter i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away after waiting for almost a month	14
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c a completely pathetic rip off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond	14
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere	14
0	i own a more expensive braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who i was n't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush after 7 months the toothbrush wo n't turn off something is shorted out unfortunately i no longer have the receipt my more expensive model which i use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years	14
0	why are you paying such good money for a no calorie water \? ! how many calories does water have to begin with \? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial \( \? a cheeseburger \? \) please do not buy this fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity the makers of this water are thieves and con artists	14
0	this is the best diet product ever ! i tried them all and skinny water \? is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever the product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much i drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away i lost 15 lbs in 20 days great taste it works great and it 's so inexpensive great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight the owners should hire me to do commercials for them	14
0	read some reviews that say my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day and ask yourself would n't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day \? ! this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value if you wo n't drink water and exercise unless you have special water imbued with mythical powers than by all means this is the product for you but if you prefer to save your money simply exercise eat healthier and drink regular tap water	14
0	only works properly if you are not moving and in a zero gravity environment	14
0	received the item but it did n't work nor did it have very good instructions e mailed company 4 times with no response	14
0	i 've got this meter a month ago i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest the meter gives a reading after several attempts but often inaccurate you have to stay still as a statue for 10 20 seconds to get a reading now i'm using it as an exercise watch stopwatch	14
0	the foil is a bit misleading because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves \( under the zipper \) the timmer will catch you and it hurts a lot the foil can only be used on straight surfaces the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer well be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa	14

0	i bought this from amazon and i do n't like it the masured temperature drifts from 96 8f to 99 6f in 6 minutes so inaccurate	14
0	i purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons i made at the doctor 's office i next purchased an omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable the wrist unit is very cool but did not live up to consumer reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity i'm technically savvy an excellent instructions follower and really wanted to like this unit but i cannot recommend it skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible	14
0	i bought this for a far sighted relative but it did n't magnify enough and was distractinly blurry so the gift was n't well received i give this two thumbs down	14
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them i am very disappointed the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste it 's very hard to clean it 's loud and small brush not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive no thank you	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
0	i was so excited about this product but when i got it i was deeply dissatisfied the box was damaged it was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides i will be returning this product for a replacement i do think that the box is really cute however if i receive another damaged box then i will never buy another thing from this website	14
0	the bars look like mudpies are very dry and all three flavors taste the same meaning that they do n't have much flavor at all i much prefer certain flavors of balance bars the only good thing about these clif bars is that i do n't get hungry for several hours after eating one	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
0	this product is worthless save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank i'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in	14
0	although it kept time \( which indicates the batteries were good \) this did n't work the first day i used it it worked the second day it stopped working by the third day and the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost this was a complete waste of 19	14
0	this was a piece of junk neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly we wound up throwing it away going to target and buying one of their 10 000 steps pedometer that works great	14
0	my husband purchased the pedometer with fm radio for me i loved it and used it non stop for about a week after a week the battery case top fell off so i could not keep the batteries in the fm radio worked only once i thought i had a short in the headset good idea but really did not perform last for the money	14
0	pedometer part is fine radio part is useless	14
0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill ins with my new scrapbooking hobby the outside is precious but once you open it the pages are like a black and white newspaper material and they have no structure what so ever the pages are boring and do n't look very durable	14
0	what a disappointment ! the device just was n't predictable sometimes it would do as expected sometimes not it was just a crapshoot finally unplugged it and it 's in a drawer somewhere yes i played with the sensitivity with no success getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince the clapper to do its thing save your money and look elsewhere	14
0	the product does not work as it is shown on tv there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust	14
0	enough single use garbage diapers are used in the u s each year to reach to the moon and back think about where they come from and where they go what kind of world do you want your kids to live in \? cloth diapers are not difficult and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies they have no where near the negative environmental impact	14
0	frankly suggest not to buy will regret a lot after buying ooooo aaaa ouchhhh tooo painful and hair starts growing in a weeek and taking very loooooooooooooong timeee to finish one hand dont buy	14
0	amazon and this company are nightmares i ordered this scale a month ago and the expected ship date keeps changing i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever he was no help at all after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade all he was able to give me was the ship date range which has already changed several times amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time	14
0	ordered this item on sept 28 they were supposed to ship it within 1 week after 1 week i received an email they said they needed 2 more weeks another email today \( nov 7 \) they think they can deliver it by november 27 that 's 2 months after i placed my order at this point i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year fortunately with amazon they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order which is what i am going to do right now	14
0	stay away from this seller salter i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away after waiting for almost a month	14
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal do not buy this product	14
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c a completely pathetic rip off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond	14
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere	14
0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
0	why are you paying such good money for a no calorie water \? ! how many calories does water have to begin with \? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial \( \? a cheeseburger \? \) please do not buy this fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity the makers of this water are thieves and con artists	14
0	the charlatans who makes this deserve to be shot and so does anybody stupid enough to buy it eat a balanced diet and get some exercise do n't be a moron all your life	14
0	read some reviews that say my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day and ask yourself would n't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day \? ! this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value if you wo n't drink water and exercise unless you have special water imbued with mythical powers than by all means this is the product for you but if you prefer to save your money simply exercise eat healthier and drink regular tap water	14
0	i bought it new after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower it stopped working i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior including the electronics they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower i have not opened the shaver i have not cleaned it in water thus based on my experience this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	14
0	received the item but it did n't work nor did it have very good instructions e mailed company 4 times with no response	14
0	i 've got this meter a month ago i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest the meter gives a reading after several attempts but often inaccurate you have to stay still as a statue for 10 20 seconds to get a reading now i'm using it as an exercise watch stopwatch	14
0	this device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity one must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding at best this device might manage to acurately read a pulse after a strenuous activity is concluded	14
0	i returned this biofeedback software and hardware i was happy with amazon 's quick credit back to my credit card but i found this purchase totally lacking the games it had you play were boring and i would n't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
0	expensive and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time after getting up from nights sleep i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again	14
0	purchased this machine for my wife \( born 1949 \) who has high blood pressure \( 150 90 untreated \) and type ii diabetes had high hopes as this was not a drug related therapy but was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results yes she enjoyed using it but her blood pressure was not improved here is my analysis for your consideration if your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life resperate may work for you but there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis so carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying	14
0	all this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing i looked at it for a long time i never found a clear explanation of what it actually is so i tried it and it seems like it should cost about 11 99 save your money	14
0	when i got this pedometer i found that the instructions were n't clear i never did get the thing to work i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate this one was n't the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost it 's just easier to buy a new one however i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store	14
0	this pedometer is so much cheaper \( 7 \) than the typical decent ones \( that go for about 18 20 \) now i know it is for a reason the buttons are flimsy the package looks very cheap the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen did not work also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device terrible ergonomics form factor would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron oregon sc 18 pedometers much better form factor high reliability and quality	14
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them i am very disappointed the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste it 's very hard to clean it 's loud and small brush not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive no thank you	14
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them i wish i had known this before now i have to waste about 20 in shipping to return it do not buy for body fat measurement	14
0	the scale part works fine but the fat measurement does not work if you care about fat i 'd recommend using the hand held device instead it gives more accurate reads	14
0	every time i use the product 3 out of 4 times i receive an error and have to try it agai	14
0	the first shave seemed good but the second time did me in with the fusion instead of just one nick i managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once but looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock i got a merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor the blades are a huge savings merkur blades or feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece the feather blades are extremely sharp ! the gillette sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry a good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor a badger hair shaving brush some proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable relaxing for me !	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
0	until i bought several weeks worth of rayovac alkaline d cells i used duracell alkaline d cells every week i run a 3 cd changer \( jvc cx xc370 \) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes at the same volume level \( volume 10 \) from tuesday to thursday the duracells lasted all 11 hours \( and might last even longer \) in contrast these rayovac d cells for the last three weeks \( maybe four weeks \) have consistently died during the second half of the next to last class \( after hour 9 5 and before hour 10 \)	14
0	the bars look like mudpies are very dry and all three flavors taste the same meaning that they do n't have much flavor at all i much prefer certain flavors of balance bars the only good thing about these clif bars is that i do n't get hungry for several hours after eating one	14
0	i was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning cds yet i was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched as for scratches you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you the solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches i tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same multiple applications fared no better the disc i bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when i started	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
0	this product is worthless save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank i'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in	14
0	this was a piece of junk neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly we wound up throwing it away going to target and buying one of their 10 000 steps pedometer that works great	14
0	pedometer part is fine radio part is useless	14
0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill ins with my new scrapbooking hobby the outside is precious but once you open it the pages are like a black and white newspaper material and they have no structure what so ever the pages are boring and do n't look very durable	14
0	this book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st 2nd and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages so this book wasnt worth what i payed for it	14
0	the product does not work as it is shown on tv there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust	14
0	much too rough and dry for our baby if you want to find good baby wipes i recommend the pampers sensitive wipes which are soft and moist	14
0	these wipes are very rough we bought these when our daughter was first born and i ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime i used them if your baby has sensitive skin i would recommend the huggies newborn or the huggies supreme wipes wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are imagine how your baby 's bottom feels afterward	14
0	oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through well gee if they like it you must too there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers guarantee that this works after you pay 5 6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening well it probably is in your psyche if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead ca n't seem to find the guarantee on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit	14
0	the slippers look nice and smell great they were difficult for me to get on my feet the lining was too restrictive once they were on they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps it 's unlikely that i will ever use them on my feet i will only use the inserts for aromatherapy	14
0	the item pictured here is not what you will receive you will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design most important is that the model you get will not have the little orange change filter indicator this very important feature takes the guess work out of when to change the filter do n't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured thanks pj berk	14
0	i bought this with the notion that i would be receiving what was pictured the filters that have a built in replacement gauge oops ! what i ended up with was the cheaper replace every two month whether they need it or not filters oh well whats a little customer service when there 's a buck to be made not like it 's false advertising to send people a cheaper product then what they thought they were getting	14
0	it is a great disappointment with amazon when it pushed to sell a product wes9006pc replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the panasonic es8162s pro curve elite convex wet dry shaver i purchased amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if i made a purchase those products together i would save money now i was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with wes9006pc replacement	14
0	i bought this from ioniczone themselves it does not work i kept it on for an entire month the filter was never dirty at all also this unit is extremely small the pic is rather misleadingi was however able to return the unit to the office in nv had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite i went on to buy one from ionicpro and what a difference it was filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty	14
0	this product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out by chance i read an article today in the jan 16 issue of time by andrew weil m d he advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy he recommends anarctic krill oil amazon has it but it is expensive i guess i 'll throw out the almost full bottle of nature made read up on it mercury is bad stuff	14
0	there are two thing that i do n't like about this set the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient i would n't recommend them	14
0	i 've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment and i figured this would suit my mopping needs it has n't even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the wetjet i 've found that it does n't really pick any dirt up what i wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere i'm even using the special hardwood floor solution it is n't making a difference i do n't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor \( and there are probably better solutions for that as well \)	14
0	i was looking forward to get the massager which i was for a while searching but i regret to inform you that i could use this item for only 2 times 15 minutes after the it did n't work \( the light on the adapter do not work \) i'm glad that i can express this	14
0	i bought this item and returned it after it stopped working after two days the massages were not that strong and i feel it was not a good buy even though the price at amazon was way lower than most places i have since bought another product and it is much nicer	14
0	i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it well i really do n't care for it and now i ca n't find the return sticky label to return it and i'm really bummed about that because it cost 55 ! ! maybe if you could help me with that that would be great ! thanks beck	14
0	absolutely no power whatsoever if you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower no power at all in this machine	14
0	i bought this monitor because it was affordable and i thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my bp regularly it is easy to use but i got much different readings than the readings i got from my arm cuff the dr and several other sources i returned it and will stick with what works for me	14
0	this thing is unbelievably lame it does n't massage it vibrates y'all have sat in massage chairs before at sharper image or brookstone they can be really good with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage this thing does n't even resemble those chairs trust me i am sitting in one now it is my main office chair i have not turned on the massage function or even plugged it in since about three days after i bought it the massage feature is more like an annoy feature it just shakes you around a bit but does n't actually feal good in any way	14
0	i did not get the instructional dvd so i was left with a clipper set i did n't know how to use	14
0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair he 's got thick hair that we like to keep buzzed short the first time i used the clippers he complained that they really pull at the hair i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair i 've decided to send it back reasonably priced but not worth the pain not recomended for thick hair	14
0	i hate this product i receive it as a gift and all the products are not adapted for babies plus looks very cheap !	14
0	it 's kind of bulky for a diaper bag which is why i got it the clippers are not good quality the thermometer is cheap it has a little f for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading the f is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming 5 week old it also takes a while to read	14
0	the only thing that i have really used out of it has been the nail clippers otherwise i wasted the money on it and could have put it towards something more useful well i guess you and learn it was my first baby everything looks great and needed	14
0	pure junk i 've tried this several times it does n't repair scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk the first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface and the second trick is to try to get your money back the method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers	14
0	but leaves a lot to be desired in practice just get a small electric or hand crank food processor this is not worth your time	14
0	i love this turban it enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head it 's lightweight and extremely absorbant i have been using one for more than 5 years i 'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair	14
0	it warms ok not great but the worst thing is the massage is loud ! i work at home in my basement where it gets cold and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm and was excited to get massage too however i ca n't use the massage feature while i am on the phone it is way too loud and there is no control on the heating element just on and off a disappointment i still use the heat feature but also wear thick socks	14
0	this product does not massage at all just vibrates i have it under my desk at work and rarely use it very disappointing	14
0	it looks alot better than it works very bad vibrations	14
0	does not measure up to the shihatsu 110 ac messager which actually works this unit has multiple vibrating buzzers i could not feel the heat the motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids' giant bass speakers	14
0	this is my first purchase that i have been unhappy with the tingler arrived with two of the tingles off attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful i had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response i would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address jon fresh2716 ne lorie dr hillsboro or 97124 the tingler was to be part of a massage christmas gift for my wife i would appreciate your time in this matter thanks jon fres	14
0	while the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside i have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better i called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but do n't have any solutions i asked if they had a website i could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2 3 months right	14
0	do n't waste your time and money on this product i have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months two in the last week all of them have had defective switches amazon should not sell this product the quality of the switches is unacceptably poor 3 13 0	14
0	i ordered one and had it arrive totally broken amazon sent a replacement that too was defective save your time money and buy another maybe in person i'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping \( amazon is giving me a refund including shipping so there 's not a problem there	14
0	i also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months i really loved this machine though ! it actually blew air ! and it has the nice safe switches unlike the toggles that most have now i had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while i was gone and almost burned the place down so anyway i'm trying to contact the manufacturer but i doubt it will do any good too bad loved it while it worked hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before i saw the reviews	14
0	i figured for the price how could you go wrong \? well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether no hot air no cold air nothing ! ! this item looks like a great deal but save your and buy something that will last you longer than 2 1 2 months the manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product !	14
0	this is not one of the best hair dryers i 've had at best it 's average the nozzle is too long and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal i like attachments that can rotate so that i can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair the ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair after using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths \( about 3x a week \) the switch for heat settings is now loose the dryer only blows cool air even though i slide the switch for higher temperatures my rating has gone from average to below average	14
0	you sent it to the wrong address i never recieved it i spent hours and hours trying to get the address corected then i spent hours and days trying to cancell the order your customer service rates a d ! ! ! to say the least finally i got a credit for the item but you would n't give me credit for the shipping ! ! i was ripped off	14
0	these glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest poorly made and most awkward glasses i have ever tried on they are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store pure garbage do n't waste your money i ca n't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner	14
0	this product is not even directionally accurate it said that my body fat percentage was 10 higher than actual then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25 body fat perhaps we had a lemon but i am taking this back because it is very inaccurate in fact this is the first review i have ever written because i want to warn people about this product please do not waste your money	14
0	the first time i tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach the screw holding the spring on was defective what a dissappointment ! !	14
0	i had such high hopes for this hair dryer well known brand diffuser with long fingers just like i prefer etc well the first time i used it my hair looked like i had been through a wind tunnel ! the low setting is like most other hair dryers' high settings even with the diffuser on it really blasts the air out ! i have wavy lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess this dryer may be fine for people with straight hair but i definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair	14
0	i was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it it is very heavy and i am not a weakling ! it is also very big with my arm stretched out all the way i can barely get it to my head because it is so heavy and big i have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers' just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer	14
0	this morning i spilled coffee on my million dollar white dress shirt it left me with three large coffer stains i remembered that i had my tide to go in the car after drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions most of the coffee stains had disappeared what remained however were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread so most of the coffee stain was gone but i'm left with the unsightly rings not quite as noticeable but there 're still there	14
0	these glasses were a bit of a disappointment the convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment and actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use great idea but maybe some fine tuning would help like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck	14
0	it works but it takes a long time to really trim it down very low power made of plastic i do n't recommend this product	14
0	this product just does n't cut my nose hair as close as the panasonic it replaced if i could remember the model of the panasonic i would mention it in this review i hope i can find the manual for the panasonic so i can get another one beware that many of the new designs are going this rout \( even panasonic \) the manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration but i think its more of a liability issue on their part \( someone probably got sued for a nicked nose \) i just wo n't buy their products anymore if they 're going to design them for marginal performance	14
0	this item does not work it does absolutely nothing i bought one and then was sent a second one neither one works it was a gift and i felt so bad that i gave someone a gift that did n't work	14
0	as far as i can tell even after following directions to the letter i found the readings to be wildly inaccurate for example in the morning i got a reading of 89 over 79 in the afternoon it was 188 over 155 then a bit later it was 155 over 150 nearly a flat line indicating death at my doctor 's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78 it 's a wonder this little machine did n't cause me to keel over just from shock i do n't recommend it to anyone mine is on its way back to amazon	14
0	the seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable the extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support do n't measure up the snaps that should hold the ends together do n't work basically it would be ok if it came with a soft cover	14
0	i ordered these slippers as a gift to my embarassment the gift never arrived i received an email stating that the slippers were backordered weeks later i received another email stating it would be an indefinite time before the product would be available i just cancelled the order i am defiitely an un happy customer	14
0	with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30 and you want this product keep saving and get a better one this product is not worth your time	14
0	this product hurts and ripps out your hair when you use it it also leaves ur hair smelling bur n't and smokey when you go out and it is humid ur hair will go back to its normal self and get very frizzy the only good thing is that it does not break easily	14
0	i 've had this straightener for about 3 months i loved it at first but now it 's a love hate relationship the gold plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use the effect my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results save your and buy a professional model from a hairdresser it 's cheaper in the long run	14
0	it made my skin very dry and break out because of it my floormate had the same reaction we were both very disappointed i recommend going for vitaclear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than proactiv although it is a little more expensive than this	14
0	i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b c it claims to be better than proactiv after using proactiv for a month then trying this stuff acnefree does n't compare to proactiv granted this is better than a bar of soap but it 's definately worth spending the extra 20 to get proactiv	14
0	woolite bags waste of money plan on sewing in your own zipper cause the one that comes on it will fail probably within the first 4 uses maybe the 1st keit	14
0	i bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not so inexpensive victoria secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine it does do this though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped i suppose if you have smaller cupped bras this device works wonderfully as for the larger dd or bigger cups you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball also another problem i have found is that the larger cups with underwire are really hard to use with this ball again due to the size of the larger cups otherwise i would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras	14
0	the brababy does not function as claimed the wholething came apart with the first wash this device isway too flimsy	14
0	it 's good for its purpose but not resistant the lock that close the ball broke in the first use when i tried to open the other one worked fine it 's a cheap plast material could be better and more resistant but for now it 's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras besides this product is for medium and small bras who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc	14
0	i saw that there were mixed reviews for this product before i bought it but i decided to take a chance on it anyway unfortunately both balls broke their first time through the wash my bras fell out and got squished and creased do n't buy this ! !	14
0	i used this cream for three weeks two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter from brown it went to pink but i skipped one day and it all went back you pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
0	first ou can barely tell this product makes a change in humidity levels in the room secondly it is extremely noisy and interferes with baby monitor	14
0	this item is rubbish it leaks quite dangerous since water and electricity do n't mix i got it plugged it in filled it 3 4 full and had to stop cause water was all over my floor i have already packed it up and will return it asap	14
0	we have three of these humidifiers the elephant the penguin and the cow have had them for 6 months or so in the last two weeks both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor when we got them i thought they were amazing quiet and did the job now i am deciding if i should go out and buy two more or pick another brand oh and be careful i think the steam from my sons killed his dvd player on his tv as it gets caked with the white stuff	14
0	i purchased this towel warmer for my wife she has been very disappointed it simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it i would not recommend it to anyone	14
0	when i opened the trimmer one of the attachments broke when i attempted to remove the cover if i ca n't return it to amazon i will throw it into my garbage	14
0	this device works ok jet stream is moderate noise is considerable has a lot of attachments that really do n't do much i'm not sure what the brushes even do the dual tank function is pretty good but lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part	14
0	this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it pour out all the water the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top heavy i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge it may be clumsy to refill which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher but it 's extremely easy to use	14
0	this brush is worth about 10 bucks anything more and you are throwing money down the drain	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
0	the foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my remington gets fairly easily overrated and overpriced eurotrash	14
0	it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells whistles i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great	14
0	product does not generate enough heat to provide relief to sore aching muscles the massaging action is actually a vibration action when heat is switched on the vibration action is reduced dramatically	14
0	i have always thought that a man 's shaver would work on woman 's beard this one does not	14
0	the razor is n't bad but the cleaning system is a joke mine would n't release the razor kept recleaning it plus and i am surprised that this is n't mentioned in the other reviews that i read before getting the razor the cleaning solution \( which is an expensive printer ink type of gimmick \) stinks like metal solvent bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price	14
0	used it once and put it in the dogs' tub it 's really awkward to use it sucks up your water pressure too ca n't figure it out i have incredible water pressure but with this thing on it went down to nothing stick to the original shower massage by waterpik	14
0	the shampoo works fine but it has a very different smell that i was not expecting it smells kind of woodsy spicy	14
0	this glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse since one still has full function of his her hands when using this you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing when using these gloves your hands and wrist will feel better at first but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse	14
0	this product does not do what it advertises does not work at all on my facial hai	14
0	i bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair it takes off most of it but i dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2 3 days much like shaving it off i would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day moreover on underarms it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one dont waste your money on this one	14
0	i purchased this for my mother she states that it runs too fast and it is painful i tried it myself and it hurts just like she says not recommended	14
0	even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback and it weighs about the same all the bottles are realy tiny they look like a one time use products the once you receive for free with your purchase and the brush quality is not what i expected from this company if you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it	14
0	it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it 's not all that noisy but i had no idea i 'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier does n't have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i 'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room	14
0	maybe it 's my own fault but i did n't get that from the product description it 's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips in my apartment it barely lasts through one night it 's also really noisy i am probably comparing to my last \( normal sized \) humidifier \( a vicks something or other no longer available \) which was great and lasted 3 years until hard water built up too much limescale i would have cleaned more if i 'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it	14
0	i received this tweezer for christmas so i'm glad i did n't spend anything for it because it 's not even worth 50 cents the tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs it 's a piece of crap as far as i'm concerned do not bother purchasing this product if you do you 'll regret it	14
0	this product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face i was very disapointed in it the tweezers were hard to push together the light was too narrow to be helpful the product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used i tried to use it several times and always got frustrated	14
0	the light was very good the magnifier \( very tiny \) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses but the worst part were the tweezers in themselves they were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle also i am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair these did not so they do not tweeze well at all was n't worth all the bother of a return i just threw it away it was a good idea for a product just poorly made	14
0	bought it and it worked for like a month now it just sits in my room doing nothing i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality	14
0	the mirror did not work the lights and clock did not work and i did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up i would have to get a new box and take it to the ups place to send it which would have cost me about another 10 and quite frankly it was just not worth the time nor the money	14
0	light didnt turn off mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall and mirror became foggy !	14
0	i am on my second zadro led lighted fogless mirror yes customer service was decent and they sent me a new one however the initial problem was repeated plus some it fogs up despite following directions using their spray and using words i shoul n't repeat here additionally the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months one good thing is that suction cups still hold it up as long as i press them in every week this product has problems which make a mockery of its zfogless claim save yourself the trouble do n't buy it	14
0	it does n't really smell like anything and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on but it is a good size and shape	14
0	i know everyone else has had good luck with this but not me the unit started running really slow after about a minute it also seems to scrape my face another nit pick is that the adjustable spacer does not have any marks or numbers on it so you do n't know what setting you 're on	14
0	i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back however immediately after opening the product i tried to plug it in as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged unfortunately this massager would plug in but did not start charging and therefore it could not be charged i will be returning this item	14
0	two main problems with this cordless massager the first being that it does n't hold a charge for very long you may get an hour use on a full charge and that shows diminishing power as it goes add to that it 's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment if you 're looking for something to rumble a slight bit this is for you otherwise save your money	14
0	this is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst i 've used the cold function does not work well \( not significantly enough at least \) but the hot function works fine it tends to leak the water you put in even if you keep it below the max fill line	14
0	this shaver is ok but has an electronic problem i get clean shave with little bit of effort but my main problem is with on off button just after using this for 3 4 months my shaver on off button stopped working it is always in on position i ca n't switch off the razor the only way it switches off is when the battery runs out	14
0	razor works great but it 's easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle does n't get all the hair out	14
0	i was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave i was looking for it also was taking me much longer to shave because i had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs in the end after using it for 5 weeks i took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver i am back to my razor blade i still hate shaving	14
0	got the bodybare and the ladyfair combo the ladyfair is cheap and poorly made it pulls as much hair as it cuts plus it cuts the skin the bodybare does nothing at all it 's so weak and delicate that it wo n't cut anything do n't waste your money	14
0	manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs as this device is very fragile not a good consumer product	14
0	it should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator ! i'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind i'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head neck the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator just be forewarned customers this item is not for the easily offended	14
0	the razor i bought came with packets of this gel as well as the lotion possibly due to the consistency the gel gets used up more quickly it is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is the key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol the gel has menthol so that 's why it can be irritating i read a review of shaving basics online and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol the lotion on the other hand always helps get a better shave and is quite soothing	14
0	this product does not make you hair grow at all im so freakin mad it is such a lie it makes your hair grow im soooooooooooo madddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd	14
0	i 'd give it 0 starts if that was an option ! a total piece of crap ! try cleaning it and the head falls apart ! try putting it back together and plan on doing nothing else for a long time ! do not buy this razor	14
0	the wieght is accurate but the body fat is way off i had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and i was 12 six months later i wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says i'm 25 something is off and i trust the doctor if all you want is to see your wieght its fine but the rest well find another scale	14
0	in two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds do n't waste your money the 11 sunbeam dial scale is more accurate	14
0	this scale does not weigh correctly your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in i counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time i used it this is one of the least accurate scales i 've ever used spend the extra money to get a higher quality non digital scale	14
0	i mostly want a bookstand that would hold a paperback book for me this cannot do that at all however that is not just because it is meant for large books it ca n't really hold textbooks very well either the one that i bought ended up in a box in storage and i doubt i 'll ever use it again	14
0	i had an old caruso molecular setter that finally conked out i thought the ion feature of this would be great the clicking is annoying but if it worked i would n't mind this puts out way less steam causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system then after all that it only curls about 1 2 as much so it takes longer for less curl not worth it i hope i can get another caruso but i hear they have problems now too ahhhh remember the good old days when things worked	14
0	the first one of these i received broke after 2 uses target com quickly sent a replacement at no charge and now that one has broken after about 5 uses very frustrating because otherwise it seems like a good system	14
0	i was just given this set new and was impressed by the reviews i'm not sure if it 's just my hair but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer i figured i needed to work out the kinks and give it another try again same look and that 's all the curl i have after 20 minutes concept is good just does n't work on my fine full head of hair if you want curl stick to the hot rollers	14
0	the lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm so if you want to use a lot of lotion you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up i have dry skin so i put lotion all over its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up it is n't super warm	14
0	this will require a large mitten in colder weather this does not appear to use electrical impulse this will require more adapting to than you might think when working it is accurate	14
0	i bought these professional clippers only to discover they are very unprofessional ! i am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone the blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot try looking for a better quality hair clipper	14
0	i 've used this trimmer only twice but my initial opinion will lead me to return it when trimming my moustache it 's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose i used it to cut my sons hair but it kept binding up and pulling his hair i ultimately gave up and returned to the old oster clippers i have they buzzed right through with no problem i 'll be sending this item back	14
0	i was not at all satisfied with the nightguard but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly	14
0	this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and i only wear it 4 6 hours a night this product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so i like the design and it does n't cut up my mouth but i ca n't be replacing it every other month	14
0	the sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night my jaws still clenched tight	14
0	after doing extensive research on the web i purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor while the easy fit cuff was easy to place the b p readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous b p cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor 's office since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings i returned the b p cuff to amazon for a refund	14
0	do n't waste your money on this size go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head also i'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either	14
0	i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone	14
0	i was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when i found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early i tried fiddling with the dst setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than i wanted the brightness may be a problem for some people but i found it reasonable overall a good docking station but a poor alarm clock	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
0	this is a sad invention instead of massaging it vibrates and in no way relieves stress besides this it 's very low budget first off the label for a thigh massage actually vibrates at you calves \( on the ottoman \) where it is labeled lumbar it actually massages your thighs when you try the pre designed massages \( modes \) the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots the whole thing is almost musical whoever designed this chair should try a different profession besides all this the chair itself is fairly comfortable and the heat is nice although a little weak	14
0	i was very excited that one of my boys had bought me this chair but when it finally arrived i was very disppointed the motors are semi weak it does not feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that the chair 's pic is also very unrealistic in my opinion the seating it not attached its a pad very cheaply made not worth the price at all i wouldnt pay more then 80 00 for this chair !	14
0	chair is not at all what it 's advertised as does not massage just vibrates and makes you feel sick compatible with sitting on a washing machine	14
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	14
0	do n't waste your money on this size go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head also i'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either	14
0	this remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me i used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor ouch however the shave is very close expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor the design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils i have owned norelco and braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave	14
0	worked alright for a few months i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it did n't the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again	14
0	i was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it	14
0	i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington i liked that shaver so when i found the r 950 at sears on sale for 40 i decided to replace my old top selling brand rotary shaver big mistake after 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck \( especially with drier winter skin \) not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r 950 while trying to shave around the mouth i am going back to my old shaver how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave but it does	14
0	it worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working changed the batteries to no avail it 's very pretty but i have a less attractive old tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years	14
0	i got the machine for my fat muscle and water analysis as well as my weight after 1 month of use it only shows the weight the scale no longer works properly it no longer shows anything else but the weight it was a waste of money	14
0	i bought this straightener because i wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp however while it is not a horrible product i have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better i would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store this is n't any better than those	14
0	i purchased this item the middle of may it is now oct 1st and it wo n't heat up anymore ! product should last longer than 5 months !	14
0	nice idea for all of us office workers but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support furthermore the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support i am looking for something else	14
0	i have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period buy the sunbeam 902 flexible heating pad much more reliable and useful too	14
0	this pad works basically but it does turn itself after 30 minutes there 's no way to prevent that this may be fine for some uses but it 's very inconvenient for others	14
0	i had the exact same experience as stan another reviewer i bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off i could not get it started again like stan i thought it was a fluke and bought another same problem two days after buying the pad i have looked in four stores in the seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad this one should not be on the market i am sending both pads back to the manufacturer	14
0	i ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once well they do have a different cover but the listing on amazon did n't say that the pads shut off after one hour i am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself and do n't need want any auto shutoff these two heating pads are going right back i can get the regular heating pads that do n't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price	14
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head another thing they did not look cool at all they were ridiculous looking nothing like the photoshopped pictures	14
0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
0	i first bought the standard and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well i used them riding a bike in the winter months neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering \( and prevent tearing \) causes great pressure above the ear the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists	14
0	i'm sorry that i ordered these online i should have tried them first they do not fit round heads no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit the bow needs to have an adjustment too the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off would not buy another pair	14
0	i wo n't be buying these because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles if you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things then you 'll notice they are n't really wearing them its just drawn	14
0	broke after 5 days i used it the way it was meant to be used cleaned it nightly etc i had read a review that said theirs broke after a short time and ignored it i wish i had n't this is junk	14
0	i really enjoyed my nano chi iron while it lasted \( rip 7 06 11 06 \) it handles well it 's a great straightener and it 's a pretty color however i dropped it approximately two feet onto a carpeted floor and it stopped working i purchased the chi about four months ago and think that a 120 iron should be a bit more resiliant i 'll still purchase chi products but would n't recommend investing in the nano technology just yet there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out and it 's not worth having to pay an extra 35 to have it repaired	14
0	i really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that i'm not too happy about the filter does n't lock down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out the filter plops out of the top causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher it 's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it 's worth the other brita pitcher i have the filter locks into place and does n't do this	14
0	i purchased this table from another vendor the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off it also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support the table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top i promptly returned this table	14
0	fall asleep inminutes what a joke don`t waste your money on this product	14
0	sleepmd did not work for me and in fact kept me awake most of the night the next day i felt horrible partly because i got no sleep and partly because i had been ripped off for 20 i threw the pills in the trash and will never purchase any md product again	14
0	sorry sleepmd we are not impressed not only did sleepmd not work for me but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too today we feel worse for the wear and a bit ripped off no i did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed more like we were run over during the night i wanted to inquire to the company in person but ca n't find a website to do so so i plan to write i would n't recommend this product to anyone it 's a waste of money	14
0	all sleep md is is melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in you can get melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid but you do n't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it ! sleep md is a total rip off	14
0	they claim that it helps you fall asleep and keeps you asleep i did fall asleep sooner but was n't able to stay asleep i did n't find it to workwell at all	14
0	it does n't do what it 's supposed to do this gizmo is supposed to clean out the pores and generally clean up the skin on your face did n't work for me	14
0	i never received this item nor could i get a response from the company when i asked about it my opinion rip off	14
0	i think the shaver works well but the plastic is thin and cheap the biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor cleaning brush and charger i think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case	14
0	i like the idea but the slippers just are n't comfortable to stand on it 's great while you are sitting though	14
0	this is the worst shaver i have ever used it is cheaply made and completely useless do n't waste your mone	14
0	if you are looking for accuracy and durability do not by this product	14
0	this thing did not survive the unpacking inserted the battery put the housing back and bent a plastic doohicky in the inside not worth it	14
0	upon purchasing this product i 'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product i normally purchase at the salon i was horribly disappointed it was nothing at all like the typical product rather much more like water the normal scent was not present the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long i would very much like to return this it 's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon i was sorely disappointed	14
0	the foam is tooooo soft it 's does not give me any back suport that i need it	14
0	i bought the duro med 7921lcst bg because of a back injury i need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably this product is very disappointing the material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all if you need firm back support i would look elsewhere \( i do n't know of a good source yet \) if you do n't need such support then i do n't know why you 'd have any interest in this product but i suppose there could be valid reasons that i ca n't imagine	14
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room i tested it in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room and after 2 hours not even a 1 increase in humidity ! fortunately i was able to receive a full refund	14
0	was excited about this after reading the reviews but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag after buying it and trying it i went out and bought a larger one barely ever use this	14
0	i am a male i did a search and this item showed up for men however it is way too long for a man unless he is yao ming it looked like i was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees i am 5'10 tall also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback it clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity i will not ever buy another product made of this material	14
0	these item i purchase on 2 21 07 i used only for 3 week and it broke i do not kwon if i can return or not to have my money back or replace with anothe	14
0	design seems flawed a bit for the container when you pull the cord out it bumps the tank off sometimes the tank also seems a little loose when mounted i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water	14
0	yes that 's right this worked for me for only one day what a disappointment	14
0	unfortunately the stool arrived in its box without the seat as we needed one quickly we purchased a similar stool locally we returned the stool and amazon was quick to give us a refund the manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control	14
0	takes forever to shave and still does n't get everything still have to end up shaving with a razor frustrating but good concept	14
0	the design is great very light easy to handle it 's very nice to be able to use it cordless however this is the least powerful epilator i have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history \( i have gone through six epilators \) it takes forever to clear a small area	14
0	it dose good for the bikini area however you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly it did not work on legs at all it would pull a few hairs but broke the rest with out the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin the tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs razor attachment dose not work to my satisfaction	14
0	first know this it is a trimmer not a shaver ! with the included height attachment your bound to have a little fuzz still left without the attachment you get closer results but still very visible hair lines i am quite disapointed with the product because it runs on two aaa batteries the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you i would certainly not recommend this product but might be necessary if you 'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild	14
0	i did not like it it was not as i thought it was going to be i thought it would give me a closer trim	14
0	it took my 3 1 2 year old 10 seconds to defeat this it took me about 30 minutes to install it pretty ineffective as far as i'm concerned your mileage may vary	14
0	my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur	14
0	do n't bother with these i am a school nurse and not just this brand but most brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal i had to use the ear type for 8 years between pediatric icu and school nursing i got pretty good at getting consistent readings except on very small ear canals and those with a lot of wax we got rid of ours and went with an exergen temporalscanner temporal artery thermometer it takes less time does n't require probes and you can get one at costco for 30	14
0	i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i could n't get a consistent reading the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless ! ! very disappointed ! ! i returned it without even the box	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
0	after many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller size diapers i decided to give huggies another try because i have a very active toddler and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable unfortunately this comfort comes at the expense of utility my daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack when i saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back just like the smaller sizes this version does not hold anything in ! ! !	14
0	the idea was great and i did enjoy the warm lotion however i used it three times and put it back in the box the on off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time i turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out would love to recommend it but i just ca n't i use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up	14
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback save yourself money and do not buy this product it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses	14
0	i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well so i'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months as of now the battery will hold barely any charge if at all it 's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions	14
0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine i purchased this scale on the unit i received the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale when i attempt to use this scale it errors out with the ol code perhaps the magazine should retract another article	14
0	i purchased this prior to surgery thinking it would be great for recovery however the nature sounds only worked the first time i turned it on after that despite changing batteries etc the sounds never came back again i would n't recommend this purchase	14
0	was initially impressed with the backrest however because the straps are not adjustable it dose n't stay in place the one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place	14
0	the description for this cartridge says that it provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria with its aquastat antimicrobial technology if you read the literature that comes with it however it says that it prevents microbe growth in the cartridge not in your humidifier it 's not an antimicrobial cartridge it 's a demineralization cartridge whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it	14
0	do n't buy this ! i regret that i did n't listen to the people who left feedbacks the craftmanship for this item is very bad not only the product was made of cheap plastic it was missing a screw too i would not recomment this product	14
0	this thing does not stay in place i needed a sponge to prop it up also do n't let the chrome finish fool ya it 's plastic all around and feels cheap right now this is in a box going right back where it came from no good	14
0	have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz the thing died ! ! did work great while it lasted now trying a conair so keeping my fingers crossed	14
0	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months after about 2 3 weeks of use the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the off position the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks i definitely do not recommend buying this product	14
0	the first one i purchased lasted about 2 weeks then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working exchanged it for another one it lasted about 3 weeks then the same thing have now purchased a different brand would not recommend this product	14
0	i bought one and it worked great at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot but once you get used to it it does a stellar job of straightening your hair around 6 months into using the straightner the machine slowly overheated and died thinking i had a faulty model i went out and bought a new one guess what \? a few months into that one it ended the same way so basically not worth it	14
0	i'm very sorry but the universal remote control was not what i expected like when i want to turn on my tv the vcr came on and visa versa but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money very pleased about the service thanks regards yoka van dijk	14
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv dvd set too bad i liked the large numbers and light	14
0	i purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep well folks this is not what happened at all i turned on my conair su1w and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day about 5 minutes into my relaxation i almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck the volume which seemed to have been controlled by satan reached top volume although i never had touched it myself i tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring i unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times and still it would not work	14
0	i really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine but its not really that great there are just one or two sounds that u may like like the running stream heartbeat tropical forest etc the rest of them like the ocean waves rainfall thunderstorm white noice etc pretty much dont let u sleep also someone complained here about the alarm what alarm \? \? \? \? \? thats a different model which is about 20 this one is just the sounds which sound artificial if u are expecting a more natural sound move on this one is more like a radio with too much static !	14
0	this pillow offers no back support when nursing a baby i bought a brest friend instead you can attach that pillow to you and focus on helping your baby nurse instead of supporting your babies entire body pass up the boppy	14
0	you were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly the second pair seems to be pretty much the same one sputs and spurts and the other works only when i shake and tap it several times i used to own another brand of these razors that were great but i ca n't recall the name unfortunately i am very disappointed in the product but i'm very satisfied with amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can	14
0	item does not look any thing like the picture it is flat i do n't feel any difference when i am setting for long periods of time	14
0	did n't last that long when use on a digital camera ! !	14
0	this product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use	14
0	the best kind of electric toothbrush \( according to my hygienist \) is one with a rotating top to the head that way it gets the gums better i ordered this one and i do n't like it besides the lack of rotating head it is very loud and i feel like i'm going to wake up my roommates \)	14
0	the good the massage function works fine no problems with the performance and the battery holds a good charge the bad how much money is saved in construction by using thecheapest foam padding imaginable \? the ugly the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months maybe a cheaper material could have been found but i doubt it overall good in theory but very poor in execution if some real quality were put into the product it would rate potentially 5 stars 'til then you 've been warned	14
0	i 've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well i 've worn out 3 norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase i thought this razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it i have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face i'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift	14
0	i bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon i had one of the original epiladies from the eighties and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be pain free and effective well i guess you ca n't have both it 's very comfortable to use but completely ineffective it takes forever to clear each section of hair and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface so the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job i guess it 's back to the good old razor for me	14
0	this grinder was recommended to me but i have to say i find it frustrating to use juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit and grinding some things \( e g green beans \) takes a lot of force while the price is fine the high cost of shipping and handling to purchase one unit made me angry had i noticed before i bought it i would n't have ! since then i 've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores	14
0	i bought these clippers for cutting hair at home even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair the charge does n't last through one haircut the trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut and they do n't trim evenly i finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb i would n't recommend this product to anyone i was extremely disappointed in it	14
0	i gave this item as a gift so i was disappointed when after only a few months of use it was broken i'm not sure what happened but my haircutter has lasted for years	14
0	the adjustable slider combs are horrible and i found the conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me i cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short it would not even take any hair off all it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery i thought this was the best brand out there but conair beats them by a mile i think i will take it back and get a refund and go buy a conair with the money	14
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser but in the satin finish from the first only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work \( yes we followed the instructions carefully \) two months later another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable instead of this loser try the dispenser 71450 classic iv we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty but so what it works and the aviva does n't	14
0	i purchased these as a christmas gift for my daughter they take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair for the money i do n't think they were worth it	14
0	i got this curler set and i completely regret it ! i used it once and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy and there was a bump from where the clamps were it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down i would n't even give it one star take my advice do not buy this !	14
0	i bought this for my lower back i am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time it is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other however the inner pad bunches up tremendously i have used it for a few weeks now and have to take the cover off to open the pad back up by stretching it out again it has n't gone back to the original shape if i had known it would do this i would have never purchased it	14
0	i wish i 'd listened to the other reviews i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me claims a five year warranty but i ca n't return it to amazon so it 's just money wasted be smarter than me avoid this product if you value your money	14
0	this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out i was delighted with the larger size but the new pad did not heat at all i returned it to homedics \( along with the 5 handling charge \) and two months later they sent a replacement the replacement heats up but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted it almost looks like it has melted to itself and it ca n't be flattened out i wo n't be sending this one back with another 5 handling charge it is n't worth it this one goes out with the trash and i go back to sunbeam	14
0	had this for less than a month and it just stopped heating the only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nice but for the dozen times used it was not worth buying will be returning it	14
0	unfortunately this is poorly designed it is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive	14
0	the elastic part is tape and my husband accidetly stuck it to our daughters legs when i changed her diapr next she screamed because the tape was on her leg not the diaper this could happen to anyone nd i'm sure it 's not good for a new baby 's skin	14
0	i purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we 've been trying different diapers i was instantly disgusted by the scent when i opened the package the diapers are scented and it does n't say so on the package i would never have bought them if i 'd known that the worked fine for leaks and those related worries but every time i put one on her i was irritated i want to smell my baby pooh incidend or not when i pick her up i do n't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers shes my child she smells its ok	14
0	the plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner i was not in the same state when the package arrived so i was not able to open it for over a month my loss i do n't know if it was not structurally sound or if the box was just not handled properly either way i 've got a dud	14
0	i followed the instructions and did n't overuse it the motor went after 2 months i miss it so much that i am considering getting another one even though i never got my money back for the first one	14
0	i suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something but dear god that thing is ugly	14
0	i 'd give this machine 5 stars if 1 \) it was n't so expensive and 2 \) it was n't so darn small it barely fits anything inside it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two but that 's about it anything else just wo n't fit and the design of the inside with the piece in the middle makes it even more restricting in my personal opinion this product is not worth the money i am so disappointed because it sounded so perfect but its just not	14
0	i had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me if it had n't broke i 'll give if 4 stars	14
0	just used this razor for the first time could not get a close shave out of it at all the trimmer will cut hair but not stubble on top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash i'm very disappointed in this razor but i guess i got what i paid for i'm going to order a new razor right now because i ca n't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary	14
0	the bed lift system is ok if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read however i did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you were n't centered in the bed	14
0	i bought this after i read the first review below \( the one who gave this 5 stars \) it just does n't work very well i do a better job pumicing on my own \( it just takes more effort \) the motor does get extremely hot and the batteries die very quickly the box says it can run for 45 minutes on two aa 's but after about 5 minutes you can feel it slow down definitely not worth it i'm calling today to return it	14
0	i tried this product because i had been using arthred g powder which was discontinued this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it it tasted and smelled rather like soap if you used arthred g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage there is no comparison here ! ! ! i would totally avoid this product	14
0	i like how quickly the rollers heat a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour however like the other reviewer said i absolutely hate the clips they are all one size so they are too large for the smallest rollers i also do n't like them because they do n't keep the roller still like the u shaped clips did and they leave a dent impression in my hair i do n't recommend them primarily because of the clip system	14
0	i 've tried this razor for 5 weeks both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that i 've ever used it does n't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble i shouldhave bought a new norelco instead of this my old norelco alwaysshaved me close this panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor or to be used in a pinch but for a close shaving everyday razor this is n't the one to buy oh well i waited too long to send it back	14
0	the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct the description of this product is a misnomer the heating pad never heats up and takes forever to just warm up on a scale of 1 to 5 i would rate it a zero ! do n't waste your money on this i will be returning mine	14
0	i bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three so i thought one of them might actually be hot instead the highest setting is warm to the touch not hot this may be a lawsuit friendly reality with heating pads today i 've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago \( i had that one for 10 years the sunbeam replacement i bought prior to this one lasted 2 and was n't hot \)	14
0	good scale could have been better designe for feet fat measurement pretty close	14
0	i 've had this for about a month and i 've used it less than 6 times even though i 've carefully handwashed it and merely wiped off the ice ring the ice ring has sprung a leak \( ewww blue liquid on my celery ! ! \) the lid is difficult to snap on remove the center container lid is really too tall for its diameter which makes using it for dipping rather awkward	14
0	i tried with two sets of new batteries the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened besides that the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear avoid this item	14
0	it looks cool and i ordered one it turns out a bad choice the product is totally ineffective do not buy this unless you want to end up returning it like me	14
0	though the description of this product says it 's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat i used them once and then packed them away because i do not like the odor i wish the mitts had been unscented perhaps over time or by next winter the odor will be gone and i 'll get some use out of them	14
0	i just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one i had for years i read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices price being the primary concern the saying you get what you paid for is true ! ! the heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap pay more and be happier	14
0	i had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut off and it works wonderfully i just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut off valve that they do not mention in the product description ! i wanted a heating pad without automatic shut off ! i can get a heating pad with an automatic shut off anywhere	14
0	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff but now they do i guess this is considered an improvement but i bought them for an elderly cat and she ca n't reset the control every hour they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff	14
0	ordered a new pen and pencil set opened the box only to see made in china i dont even want them now	14
0	worst product on the market ! a huge disappointment i was very careful to use as directed the result \? one big mess ! the lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and i had no choice but to throw them away	14
0	it 's a gimmick looks good on tv does n't do what it says i'm embarassed to admit i even tried it	14
0	the product is all smoke and mirrors unless you have a clean room and are incredibly talented you will not have lenses that are usable in fact several attempts to use the product resulted in lenses that were worse	14
0	this pad barely got warm it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried i suspect it is n't defective but intentional probably for legal reasons but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it \? \?	14
0	this thing is a cheap piece of plastic and for the same price you can get the larger nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well i can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor it has a nice design in terms of look and it 's compact i also enjoy the lights for ambiance but for relaxation this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it 's worth	14
0	these 'cartridges' sell for about 2 a piece plus shipping i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave \( much better than an electric in my experience \) but the single blade is actually much smoother i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor each blade lasts a little over a week versus the mach 3 at 1 50 2 00 lasting 6 or 7 days	14
0	not really an improvement over standard mach 3 cartridges and certainly not worth the price jump the shave quality still does not match that by an old fashioned safety razor	14
0	this product might do for a backpacking weekend with the boy scouts but compared to a blade razor or even an electric it leaves a lot to be desired i recommend giving it a pass	14
0	looked like a good product with a good price unit failed to turn on or ever take a charge despite plugging in properly and trying to charge overnight as suggested in the instructions now i have to go and deal with returning it to amazon shipping it back getting another one etc am willing to change my review upon receipt use of a new unit but definitely not giving a five since now i have to go through this trouble	14
0	the shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible this razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary but using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin this razor does not poduce a light lather it is more like a slime that drips from it i did not notice a tropical scent	14
0	had to return this b p cuff could not get it to work properly medical devices need to be made a great deal better than this one	14
0	it was alright but in a warm jacuzzi tub it did n't last very long	14
0	i found this razor as the same as the other ones do n't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one the only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose et	14
0	gillette has a quality control problem with the blades this is a recent problem but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to schick disposable razors the gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face the blue strip degrades after only a few shaves and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face	14
0	does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 43	14
0	i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement it 's nice and quiet and i'm sure the vacuum works great but i would n't know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim we 're talking about hairs easily 1 4 in length a trimmer should be able to shave those down do n't you think \? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors do n't bother even trying this product it 's a waste of money	14
0	my rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set regardless of me using more or less hair maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio if so it is impossible to find i dunno but i do know i would not recommend these also even when i get these to stay in my hair my hair does n't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers overall buy something else	14
0	the pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use i do n't like them	14
0	unless you have the physique of an nba player find another make of massager this one is too heavy hard or impossible to hold and very awkward to use if used by one person on another it might be usable on the positive side it does give you a good massage	14
0	do not buy this iron it 's fabulous while it works for which it does merit the one star but it broke in less than a week it overheated or something and then would n't turn on again but here 's the kicker if you buy it from amazon the company wo n't honor the warranty i do n't have particularly heavy duty hair this is just totally unacceptable	14
0	however after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from amazon it is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay so if you have had good luck with one so far be glad because i paid for the 2 day shipping could n't wait and have great disappointment because now i have to return it !	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts not worth the at all i'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam	14
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that my soup was luke warm at lunchtime	14
0	would rate at no stars if possible first one failed after 7 months would not hold charge it was replaced under warranty the replacement failed after 8 months again would not hold charge customer service said to send in for repair no estimate of how long i 'd be without a razor my response is forget it braun here i come	14
0	i'm a fan of the line i love the chocolate but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting vanilla should be subtle this was more like taking a shot of extract	14
0	i really wanted to love this fragrance after all it is quite expensive and i 'd read rave reviews on many websites but after one spritz i sold it to a friend of mine ! my favorite perfumes are beyond paradise ralph lauren romance ralph lauren style and dkny be delicious light blue to me smells overwhelmingly of musk i wore it all day and i ended up feeling nauseous with a bad headache this must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me	14
0	i 've been taking these for over 3 weeks i have not seen any new hair growth i think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster i would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from gnc or any other place you can find them they are much less expensive	14
0	this does n't even deserve 1 star this supposed relaxation gadget was a complete waste of time and money it had no heat as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching \( \) instead of relaxing it has increased my stress level 150 ! ! \(	14
0	i got this as a gift for my husband he used it for about 3 weeks but still had red marks and had to follow up afterwards with a regular disposable razor the whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and was n't as good luckily braun had a 30 day money back guarantee so we were able to return it \( minus shipping x 2 \)	14
0	a big disappointment after filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the warmer as advertized it was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place i returned it for a refund	14
0	i had ordered this item expecting good things from it however the article has never worked properly the electrical system seems to be working fine but the uv light has never come on somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize right now the product is only a toothbrush holder nothing more i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it in short i wo n't buy anything like this again	14
0	this product states 4 toothbrushes that is incorrect it only holds 3 this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter that is also incorrect you cannot use 4 aa i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me if those things do n't bother you it might be what you are looking for but since it does bother me i never even tried it	14
0	i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n't smell too much however i 've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads i'm 25 with an oily t zone and very dry facial skin on mornings after using this cream i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin there are better products out there	14
0	this may work well but the cuff size is not as it is in the description it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches not even close my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far sure you can get the cuff to go around your arm but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly and there was just no way to even come close	14
0	i'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened my general experience with cross pens has been very positive this one however is awful it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere	14
0	i have been using cross product for lat 15 years this product which is made in china has highly disappointed me the finish of the pen is very poor gold plating is of a poor quality it has some patches of a different color the body has sharp edges overall it has spoilt my impression about cross products regardsr p kal	14
0	i do n't recommend this ashtray to anyone i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in other people tried besides me there was no way to contact the company as their website does n't seem to exist anymore at least i could n't contact them after numerous attempts	14
0	it 's quality is cheap and poorly made i bought two thinking it was a good deal but i threw them out after 2 days because the on off switch did n't work it was also very loud	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14
0	returned right after i tried it does not get hot at all very disappointed since it is so expensive	14
0	cheap product in all means it riped off my hair while straightening and did a very lousy jo	14
0	i have had this straightener for about a year it will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and i have to use the high heat settings also my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener	14
0	i bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it i was not it snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude very unhappy with this purchase	14
0	thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush but no my hair is long ish and kind of fine straight the brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush so i could n't get the full volume results i wanted i can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better it is very loud though i returned mine	14
0	first of all let 's talk about the noise level on this thing yikes ! that should be against some kind of consumer protection law the blowdryer part is ok but did n't like the brushes at all i 'll go back to my conair stying brush and my straightener live and learn	14
0	i thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great i would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product also i loved the pink when i opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off i tried to snap them into place but they would not stay for the amount of money i payed i expected a much better product needless to say i returned it the next day	14
0	i'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so i do n't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer i follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before i get a consistent reading i threw mine away	14
0	this is the most innacurate thermometer i have ever come across each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more moreover the battery only lasts for 1 2 uses granted one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature but you would think the battery could last a few more times when you have a sick child accuracy and time are of the essence	14
0	thought this would work should have known better a pen light would do the same thing do not waste your money or you will look as silly as me i returned the piece of jun	14
0	this machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions a bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank	14
0	made of cheap plastic generate loud noise the switch broke off the 2nd week i got it	14
0	i ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price but it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues the pedicure set is hard to use the bubbles are not effective i guess cheap is expensive ! ! !	14
0	i would give it negative stars but that was n't an option this thing is horrible does n't cut very close certainly does n't hold a charge engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes and oh yeah the horrible razor burn ! ! ! seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams	14
0	the battery life is the worst of any electric razor i 've ever used the razor does n't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses the razor is very cheaply constructed and i would not recommend this to anyone you 're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine	14
0	i 've used much better electric shavers in the past i find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin	14
0	it vibrates like a massage mode of sonic complete you 'll get less than what you pay you should brush hard even while it is vibrating	14
0	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best however this unit is nothing like sonic complete the sonic energy is completely in the handle it 's like holder a vibrator the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads	14
0	pull ups are not very good for potty training they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom potty training does not include using diapers that is what these are is fancy diapers if you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them the wetness liner is a joke these also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants	14
0	when i gave birth i had already bought packages of newborn huggies they were horrible i thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then nope i 've tried huggies supreme and the cheap huggies they are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them i thought since everyone always talks about pull ups that they would work once potty training time came around wrong again they leaked evertime he wore them do not waste you money i always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers cruisers and training pants pampers are the best	14
0	because if you do this is the unit to do it with ! the combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro 's internal circuitry with metal deposits no i do not work in a metal shop i use my computer solely in my apartment room yes it is from the humidifer the dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas	14
0	top of the line \( april 2005 \) d cell nimh batteries have 11 000 mah compared to this one 2 200 mah \( they cost 16 bucks but 10 000 mah battery costs six bucks \) top of the line aa nimh batteries have capacity of 2500 mah top of the line nicad d cell batteries have 5000 mah capacity \( costs around five bucks \) i thought that nimh was more capable than nicad true but not in this case so what are we gettting here \? higher aa battery capacity in d cell case this battery is overpriced for what it delivers	14
0	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips wrong answer i was able to play 2 1 2 cds before my box was out of juice game over i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left i figured they 'd at least last into the night but they were finished before sundown do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices i got fooled fool me once shame on you we ca n't get fooled again	14
0	this scale is too small i have size 11 feet and my feet dont fit on the scal	14
0	we already owned a different homedics sound machine and it 's far better than this one the volume control does n't work well at all on this machine either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static no matter where we used the machine the product seemed very flimsy as well we ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine	14
0	would work great except this does n't fit my new waterpik ultra \( wp 100 \)	14
0	i bought this shaver about one year ago for years i was using braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition in spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan i gave panasonic a try shaving is fine it runs quiet and you get 5 7 shaves with one charge after about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3 4 shaves with one recharge month later slowly went dead exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards what make me to believe to those people writing reviews you would expect more shave for 100 today i went to buy braun shaver	14
0	i purchased two aquis microfiber waffle white \( 19 x 39 inches \) towels althoughthey are quite expensive the positive reviews made them sound great well theyare not the towels are quite thin and do not rub slide well on the skin they givethe feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up whenyou rub your skin they are the same thickness as a dish towel so we are using them to blot the disheswhen they come out of the dishwasher save your money on this one !	14
0	this pillow is soft and sqwishy but it is too small also there is a vibrator inside that does n't work i just cut out the battery case and use it once in a great while	14
0	i 've only used the unit 3 times and the flip over trimmer broke when i flipped it over to attach to the main clipper head the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head that cracked in two and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor it 's very disappointing i'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer i ca n't seem to find the receipt	14
0	does n't work on coarse hairs does n't remove only trims okay for fine light hair of course if you have fine light hair you do n't need to try to remove	14
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback save yourself money and do not buy this product it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lense	14
0	does not maintain water temp splashes all over at the proper water level rollers hurt noisy weak vibrations i would n't want one for 5	14
0	i agree with the other reviews it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water it is only supposed to maintain the temperature but after using it for about 20 minutes it did n't even do that the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth back to the store indeed	14
0	i purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem big mistake ! it simply will not stay put no matter what chair i tried it with the arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much it has you bending over backwards i believe it actually made my back ache more	14
0	i bought this product in rite aid unfortunately it irriates my face they are scamming people just to buy this product instead of repairing my face this product damage my face there are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since i start using this now i need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product if i knew this will happen i will not waste my money to buy this product	14
0	i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence it does not work the same and the product is not the same i must clarity that i dont want to confuse anyone here youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh or gritty it is very smooth and makes yours skin incredible and soft	14
0	avobenzone 2 0 homosalate 15 0 octinoxate 7 5 octisalate 5 0	14
0	our first unit lasted about almost 2 months despite the relatively short lifespan i thought the product was worth it considering the dirt cheap price however the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use so it went back to amazon the very same day it arrived our home this product is so dangerous without exercising some safety precaution it can cause electrocution !	14
0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist however it is difficult to use extremely messy and the on off button on handle is difficult to press we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience our neighbors bought the same model tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave save your money and go back to flossing !	14
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect i have used waterpik dental water jets for many many years and typically have to replace every two or three years i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet i purchased the waterpik ultra and i am pleased with the design size and operation thus far i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service	14
0	i purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer first of all if this is an ionic dryer i was better off with my super cheap dryer second the back seam of the dryer melted ! ! several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying it shuts off and refuses to come back on which is good because then it might melt completely do n't waste your money on this	14
0	this dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could the problem is that it just shuts off the first time i used it it shut off twice within a 20 minute period it would n't restart when i plugged it back in or even when i tried a different outlet no matter what i tried it would n't restart for about 5 minutes i 've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened i would n't recommend buying this product	14
0	i recently bought his blow dryer and to my surprise when i use it it sends out huge sparks and smoke towards my head pretty dangerous in my opinion i do n't reccomend it	14
0	the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style it makes my arm and finger tired	14
0	of little or no use much to difficult to use when you are excercising i find this product totally unacceptabl	14
0	seriously i do n't know how anyone can use this thing i have had tatoos waxing and dental fillings and i would rather have any and all of those before i ever try this product again it feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin just awful in the products defense i do n't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly \( god forbid you try it anywhere else ladies ! ! \) i was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and i gave into the pain and went back to shaving yikes	14
0	this was a terrible product i got little sores everywhere i used it believe me i will only use it once wish i had my money back	14
0	when i bought this the other review was n't posted yet now please benefit from our two reviews this thing is a total joke useless too small \( i have larger hotel samples \) i too would like to return this but i just do n't have time before christmas amazon should not offer this item it is a complete let down over priced and just a joke no fooling	14
0	this is a cheap plastic \( except for the metal tube \) toy it 's like those hand claws for kids you squeeze the handle and the claw closes the grabber part on this thing has a 2 1 2 opening you wo n't be able to grab a small can of soup the magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger on the inside of the fingers they have rubber pads that are removable \( probably for cleaning \) but they seem to come off on their own	14
0	if you have the philip 's sonicare brand electric toothbrush do n't buy this unit they do not fit in slots i had to return mine and am out shipping handling return shipping charges just an fyi if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush \( diameter \) do n't buy it either it wo n't fit they do have a model esa302 that works with the sonicare but it is alot larger	14
0	i bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working ans i do agree the smaller the hair straightener the better \( i originally had a smaller one that my salon uses but it also stopped working \) the light is on and the heat comes off and on randomly very upsetting	14
0	i saw a commercial i read a reviews and so i bough one box at walmart it 's not worth it that 's my conclusion the trays are made of very thin plastic like material and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth the active gel easy goes out of trays and fills your mouth during first couple od uses after 20 min or so i started to feel a vague pain in my gum nevertheless i continued using the product for all 7 days as advertised 30 min a day after the whole package was gone the change of color of my teeth is barely visible i hope you will have better luck	14
0	it was an awkward mess smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered much less fit securely it 'd probably be easier without the trays i do n't know if they work or not i gave up i want my crest whitestrips back	14
0	they are a waste of time and money they put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth after a week my teeth are the same color as when i started	14
0	for the price you cant beat this product if the problem i'm experiencing can be solved i bought two of these brushes one for my home bathroom and one for my work out bag love the price and timer feature but it seems that once i 've used up the power in the brush it wont recharge properly i'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long i leave it in the charger if there is a simple fix for this then i 'd say 5 stars if not then 2 stars is well earned seeing as how i 've been on their support line waiting \( as i type this \) for over an hour	14
0	shaver is bulky sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris i would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back	14
0	has anyone taken this formula during natural childbirth and does it help \? \? \? \? \? \? please respond	14
0	skip this entire product i made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non scrubbing \( mopping \? \) pads now i ca n't find the non scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county i think they do n't want to compete with their own product swiffer which they also manufacture i emailed them and they suggested i buy online i checked walgreens com and drugstore com and no luck i imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful who gives a hoot rod	14
0	i got this device to help me clean around my place i thought it would be easy to use and it is not the pads do not stay on when you are trying to put them on the solution leaks all over you after working on my shower i saw no difference i wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth	14
0	i am suppose to be receiving a refund because i have done sent it back but i have not heard anything from ya 'll	14
0	this bp monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use bp from monitor checked closely with manual bp after the first 2 weeks got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries i can not rely on this monitor for my patient 's b p results	14
0	this scale was off by about 10 or 15 pounds i went to the doctor a few days after getting this scale and i was so relieved to find out that i was not 10 pounds heavier than i feared do n't waste your money on a scale that wo n't give you an accurate weight	14
0	this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0 the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs give or take a few from clothes i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx 20 pounds 20 pounds !	14
0	i guess it 's cheap but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight so it 's pretty hard to get anything more than a 2 3 pound estimate which is fine if you 're not obsessive but most people care about that increment	14
0	in my experience with this product i had no significant hair growth very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it and the amount of pills you have to take daily \( ugh ! \) however i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair it did change the texture of it my natural hair is very coarse and while using the hf37 it became really soft silky and manageable nice if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do but as far as hair growth absolutely not recommending hf37 for that	14
0	this is worthless and they say it 's refundable until you read the fine print and realize it 's only if you bought the entire product line it is crap and does n't do anything do n't waste your money drink milk and your hair will grow this does not work	14
0	i agreed with all the criticism that the revlon eyelash curler \( now discontinued \) received it broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload but the one thing it did well that the carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin this instrument catches my skin very easily and it 's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids	14
0	the batteries that come with this charger we 're not a problem for me in fact i was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine i was however disappointed in the charger the charger requires that all four aa batteries be in the charger for it to work you cannot charge just one two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted also there are a maximum of two slots for aaa batteries and when they are in use none of the other aa slots are usable given the price of nimh batteries the charger works out to be about 2 which is about what it 's worth at best	14
0	amazon is claming great entry level charger system charges four aa aaa nimh batteries in 6 10 hours includes four 2300mah nimh aa batteriesit is only 1800mah which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards while if it was as amazon claims it would have been a nice step up shame on amazon oversight or misrepresentation charger is cheaply made it can charge 4 aa or only 2 aaa poor design the charger that came with my camera can do 4 aaa go figure get something else	14
0	we bought this as a cheap easy stocking stuffer it 's simply not woth anything the little file is a good idea but too tiny to actually work my daughter \( 8yrs old \) liked the idea too but was sad that she could n't work with the tiny strip that 's too short for even her little fingers cute but not worth it	14
0	i had a good massaging heating pad that was great and i used it on my legs a lot thought i could replace it this one is not even in the ballpark absolutely useless i have been had	14
0	the massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone there is only 1 heat setting which is ok but it 's a bit hot for only one setting it 's like the high setting on my 3 setting hot pad	14
0	at first this seems like a pretty good drink shaker the body and lid are fairly sturdy however there 's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid and if that pops out which it 's prone to do with mine you 're left with a leaky \( and therefore useless \) shaker the seal can be replaced with a bit of effort but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle	14
0	i could really not tell any difference in my teeth after using this product i could however see how my gums were burned by the peroxide	14
0	i read the directions and followed them to a t the pain was just too intense \( on my gums they started to bleed ! \) i tried to adjust the trays every which way but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums after all the time trouble and pain i did n't see any improvement in whiteness i have used the older crest whitestrips and liked them much better	14
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest however i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help but nothing seemed to work the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist so it did n't leak out or touch my gums my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards but later in the day if you have sensitive teeth i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain	14
0	the amount of time resulted in minimal results i was very disappointed	14
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser but in the satin finish from the first only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work \( yes we followed the instructions carefully \) two months later another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable instead of this loser try the dispenser 71450 classic iv we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty but so what it works and the aviva does n't	14
0	the foot bath makes a mess with the water and does not keep the water warm a lot more hassel than it is worth sorry i spent my money on it	14
0	worthless motor is loud and heating not noticable in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm	14
0	it ran good and i liked the different attachments but i gave it away because i was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
0	last month feb 10 i ordered one box this wipes but when i opened it today all bag showed the exp 12 31 2006 i am wondering how to contact them	14
0	these wipes were much thinner than i expected remembered i had to use at least 3 at a time i wo n't buy these again	14
0	i bought this and it worked fine the first time that i used it granted it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom however i have tried it in my infant 's room 4 times this winter i used hot water salt to try to help it but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam maybe all of the steam energy is being used on the night light ! if you have your home 's thermostat set under 78 degrees do not waste your money on this item ! find something stronger to get you through the winter months	14
0	no moving parts contrary to depiction above the attachments are tiny plastic 1 5 knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet ! they do not move there is no massaging action you do all the work making your hips and knees sore the massaging foot beds are totally motionless and form a spiky painful surface vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device jets are totally underpowered no fill line indicator so bubbles spill water onto floor heater is completely useless after 15 minutes water temp was no different cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads classic deception in advertising	14
0	i cannot address the value of buying products from this manufacturer that 's for you to decide however this product performs noticably worse than its earth unfriendly alternatives clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with tide the other one i use but the decision is yours	14
0	this protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end but it has a horrible taste and texture the closest thing i can relate it to is chocolate burned egg tasting boogers i would not purchase this product again i would however purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad	14
0	i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery i have better than average hand and arm strength but i found this particular model to be hard to operate \( i ca n't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it \) normal sized cans \( like soup or beans \) slipped out of its pitiful grip i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash this is definitely a lightweight too light for much real use i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more	14
0	i took a chance \( it 's pricey \) and purchased this item quot what the heck quot i thought i used it \( a single 'squirt' \) once a day in the morning this was instead of the recommendation of twice a day i like the stuff my skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy in fact i 'd give it five stars except that now it 's three weeks since i purchased this product and 'poof ! ' it 's gone ! i figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt in my mind the 'goodness' of this product is n't worth the exorbitant price hence two stars	14
0	well i have used philips ladyshave before and i regret for making my mind to try this one it hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars	14
0	using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews i would n't dare use it on my underarms very poor shaver ! !	14
0	i recommend that you not buy this product through the mail my three boxes leaked all over the amazon box yuck	14
0	returned item as was leaking all over great product if amazon had packed it better i could have used it	14
0	i like to use the wet wipes they 're good products i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well i received the package this week all seals of three boxes were broken lids fell off and the wipes were everywhere in the package they were dried up but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet and it almost fell apart what a mess it was !	14
0	as i found it to be really much too fake lemony not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms i mixed mine w a subtle cookie type one i coud n't smell at all now can smell neither even when i put them in closets which was not the idea i like a little fragrance thru the house may look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood	14
0	it was so so and didnt see any real results but it was definently better than tend skin or mi	14
0	what a gimmick its nothing but pure alcohol i should have looked at the ingreidents list i should have bought princereigns or min but i bought into all those phony reviews below	14
0	the pick at the back of the unit is curved and does n't work well the floss is multi stranded and tends to come apart when used and does n't feel like it is very high quality floss the head is also somewhat small or poorly shaped so it is also difficult to use i used the plackers brand before and was much happier with it	14
0	the individual packaging is nice but the floss breaks frequently nexcessitating more than one to floss your teath the glide products are much nicer	14
0	these did nothing for me ask your doctor about aphthasol a prescription drug approved by the fda which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards aphthasol changed my life	14
0	i followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore even one in the flattest part of my cheek obviously they wo n't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either cankaid and kank a are still the non prescription products i have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply	14
0	when i ordered this item i assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use actually each flosser is a plastic prong with pre strung floss in it to be used once and discarded let me see a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365 000 000 plastic doodads added to the world 's landfills every year i already compromise my principles for convenience more than i 'd like to admit this is totally over the top when i 've used up my supply of flossers out this thing goes it goes into the landfill to be sure so do n't anyone else make my mistake	14
0	i did n't realize there was hfcs \( high fructose corn syrup \) in these bars if you work out or are health conscience then i would suggest doing a little online research about harmful effects of hfcs i'm about to switch up my protein bars	14
0	if you think you are buying the old met rx bars by the same flavors you are in for a very very bad surprise the old bars had better taste and a almost cake like consistency these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one also i could n't get past the taste even the color is different i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day \( years ago \) i gave the entire box away for free i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe	14
0	this bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars that much is true what is also true is that is contains more fat what you will notice with the first bite is that the bar seems somehow inflated there is an emptiness to consistency of the bar you are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a myoplex or apex bar stick with those brands for pure nutrition and far better taste these metrx bars leave you feeling as though you 've eaten something that was bad for you like after you eat a dessert yet these will not be mistaken for desserts	14
0	this piece is compact and convenient where power outlet is not available running with 3 aaa batteries the stream is too weak to do the cleaning not recommend for buying	14
0	was very disappointed by the performance of this unit not enough pressure pretty useless even with new batteries	14
0	these did not suppress my appetite though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil \( also a hoodia product \) but the next bottle of that nothing i guess like crops you can get good batches and bad batches these struck me as a bad batch as one reviewer said i actually felt hungrier many days egad ! better luck next time ! sigh	14
0	this product did not work i was faithful for 1 month with no results	14
0	we started getting a lo message when using the thermometer it said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense this worked for a little while we changed the tip on each use now nothing works after spending near 50 on this i feel like a chump i want to throw it out the window i'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else	14
0	i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha i dont suggest buying it for onions coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears	14
0	do not buy this ! ! ! it does not work as seen on t v we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it would not cut a tomato onion carrot apple only a cucumber complete waste of money	14
0	this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it very bad investment	14
0	item was not received there was a mix up and it was sent to the wrong address i hope i'm not billed	14
0	i was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source agree with other users this mirror was no better than an unlighted one	14
0	i purchased this because it was so cute and had the conair name within 6 weeks the bulb blew out and i started looking for a replacement ive been to all the local places and everyplace i could find online in an obscure place i found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage the only place i could get the correct bulb was on the conair website but they make you buy 10 bulbs then charge 9 00 for handling the cost is more than just buying a new mirror ! a rip off	14
0	i am now going through what everyone else is talking about finding replacement bulbs for 20 this is unfortunatelyfor some a throw away mirror at least ours lasted morethan 4 weeks	14
0	the mirror 's light is quite dim and the magnification \( 5x \) is inadequate for most purposes	14
0	it does n't get hot enough nor does it stay hot for more than 10 minutes	14
0	this is a very cheap memory foam it reminds me of foam rubber i have sleep on it for 3 nights and will be removing it for the fourth night do your home work before you buy this product	14
0	the mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell after receiving it i left it in an open room for 2 weeks before i can sleep on it the free pillow smells even worse it can be not exchanged since it is free i guess i am supposed to toss it since it 's free i think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable after all	14
0	i'm a huge fan of the pria line but these are not like the others they are heavier and a little grainy i do n't hate them but will not buy them again the flavor is pretty good though just not what i was expecting i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind thank	14
0	i love these bars they are high in protien and are good supplements how ever the 3 boxes i got were all expired beware of sale items on bars like this	14
0	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it i sent a review to the company with no response the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied	14
0	order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time i do not know how long because i am still waiting	14
0	i order it on july 14th but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it	14
0	they 're ok but definately not as absorbent as the overnight diapers my son soaks through if he urinates during the night	14
0	perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better my recommendation is do not buy	14
0	these are a cheap knock off of huggies pull ups and once the side comes apart you ca n't put it back together like with pull ups over all a waste of money just use pull ups they 're worth the extra money	14
0	what a disappointment the reviewer who mentioned the difficult to use switch was right it was a poor design choice needlessly heavy too with poor balance	14
0	the off on switch on this product is very difficlut to use i am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands	14
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable not so ! they tear easily better than just empty wal mart bags though but not by much	14
0	i have not recieved the vitamins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lost in the mail \? \? \? \? \? \? please let me know what i can do it has been a month	14
0	unlike several other reviewers i loved this trimmer for 5 months at that time the rechargeable battery just died completely would not recharge at all and the remington people are useless when filing a complain	14
0	the only reason that i am writing this review is because i am on line now looking for a new trimmer i bought this gem less than a year ago and was not satisfied then tonight i'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out the extra cutting heads are all but worthless i would never recommend this p o s to anybody i wish i could give it 0 stars	14
0	this is easily the worst beard trimmer i 've used it slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated and the teeth on the guard are far too fine	14
0	i have not tried the product yet as it is a stocking stuffer for my four year old the ad displays four soaps when in fact you only receive one i would not have purchased one bar of soap had i have known	14
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower even though that 's possible the very last thing this product does is remove hair at least with the epilator head the shaving head works fairly well but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective	14
0	printed all over the box are the words with infrared heat the instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water 's warm temperatures this would n't be the case the water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice but does nothing at all to keep the water warm	14
0	these did nothing for me ask your doctor about aphthasol a prescription drug approved by the fda which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards aphthasol changed my life	14
0	while the product works it 's good it was capabable of trimming eyebrows sideburns beards mustaches and that pesty stray nosehair the problem with the microtouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless it is not worth the money buy a product that costs more money and is better quality	14
0	it lasted one year and two weeks then the motor died while it worked it was great i am tempted to buy a replacement but will probably end up trying another brand the manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several because when they do work they do a great job	14
0	this product is a piece of garbage when it works it does what it is suppose to do however it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me do not buy this product	14
0	i purchased 2 of them put in new alkaline batteries and found that it will not cut hair as advertised the motor is underpowered useless product	14
0	its super cheap does not work at all will struggle with the thinnest of hairs stay away ! !	14
0	this item was disappointing because the suction cups wont stick to the bathtub unless it 's a completely smooth surface most standard tubs have some sort of a nonslip surface	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
0	this epilator by emjoi does not work without the cord attached the motor is too weak in addition the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends the middle disks since they are inset from the top never reach the hair i had to return this item and i would not trust or recommend any item by emjoi extremely poor quality and does not work as promised	14
0	this thing does n't massage just vibrate and two of the motors died quickly although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty the customer service is non existent stay away from this definitely not worth the money	14
0	paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses	14
0	edible taste not the best but i would keep buying them if i did n't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea it is not just this met rx bar that will do this to you it is any food with sugar alcohols all atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol they do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do so the theory is that they dont store fat only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom you only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom not worth it	14
0	this thing is horrible cumbersome to use and does nothing i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug carpet i'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it 0	14
0	my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray with all of the snow we have had it arrived shortly after christmas but just in time to warm her heart for the new year	14
0	i recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the andis company 22560 rechargeable cord cordless hair clipper kit	14
0	i would like to give 0 stars i 've got one battery for more than 8 with s h they say 12 batteries do not make the same mistake i made they will send you only one battery not 12	14
0	hair dryer worked good for about 1 year then the switch broke fused in the open position i would not buy an andis product again	14
0	after using the dryer \( which i liked very much and did a quick job \) i discovered that my hair was being ruined it would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces i stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair i would like to return it and get my money back ! ! !	14
0	it didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago it works just as good as a regular non teflon curling iron	14
0	plain and simple i'm 32 years old and been dianosed with hbp since 15 years old i'm on three medication for hbp i order this then i wait for it to come i jjust happen to go to the doctor today he takes my pressure and tells me its 113 100 when i arrive home one hour later the device is waiting for me i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101 75 sending the unit back	14
0	i do n't know but i could n't get myself to swallow it it made me literally vomit i wish i just ordered power bar 's vanilla yoghurt flavored one which tastes fantastic and i love so very much anyway probably it 's just me but it really really makes me sick i thought i would taste something new but oh well	14
0	dr scholl 's pedicure essentials cracked skin repair cream had a very nice smell and felt good however the long term effects were n't what i expected i could n't tell much of a difference after using it for a week regular lotion that i 've used in the past seemed to have the same effect perhaps it just needed more time to work	14
0	absolute waste of money this is not a pillow as advertised in my opinion falsely but a flat mat which when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this you could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all an extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution now out of pocket and no better off	14
0	the price is too high considering the ijoy 550 model is only us 599 99 at sharper image	14
0	i got this as a gift for christmas and i 've tried it twice so far both times i get the same result it does n't work i understand that with wet hair it wo n't dry it obviously but even with damp hair as instructed it does n't get my hair dry as for the actual straightening aspect i still end up with frizzy hair that is n't even all that straight it 's not worth the money spend the extra bucks and get a chi or infrashine you 'll be a lot better off	14
0	i wanted a good reading lamp and bought this lamp after doing a bit of research after taking the very heavy lamp out of the box and assembling it i turned it on to find that it gives off very little light i thought it might be something i would need to get used to and sat down that night to read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light i tried using the lamp during the day twilight and found that the illumination of the lamp was barely noticable though it was quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in i returned it to amazon which is something i rarely do	14
0	this shampoo made my dandruff even worse after using it it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell 's tea tree shampoo or something	14
0	too hard to use so i paid 50 for an 18 hairdryer maybe if i watched the video i could use it bette	14
0	i did n't want to spend a lot of money on an ionic hair dryer i came across this one and thought i 'd give it a try the light indicating the ionic generator is working stopped working after its first use what a waste of money !	14
0	it was not as good as i expected i felt the quality of this item was cheap therefore i returned it	14
0	this mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification \( 5x \) is not sufficient	14
0	this is a very lousy product the lighting around the mirror is absolutely useless when you turn the light on it seems like you 're still looking at the mirror with no light awful product eventhough it 's cheap but it does n't even worth a dime	14
0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification the light is not great at all it 's very dim one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy	14
0	it 's ok that helps to moisturize the skin but it 's just stays oily and cannot be absorbed appropriately in the skin	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	i bought this item for the warmth the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on as for the massage it 's about what i expected no good at all overall i would say this item is worthless	14
0	this one 's going back to the store it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat if you ask me my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat as for the massage it 's worthless to me but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway i prefer shiatsu i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14
0	after 5 days of minimal use this pad stopped working kaz replaced it after 3 days of use the pad stopped working again kaz replaced it again after 7 days of use the pad stopped working a third time but this time kaz voided the warranty ! then they said i should get an electric blanket if i wanted to keep warm i wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache	14
0	this shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower but that 's about it the shave is n't very close and it takes a long time to shave to do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor	14
0	this product is called a bouffant style oversized shower cap it is so small that it would not fit over my wife 's head the product features list claims it is made of soft pretty fabric in fact it is made of thin crunchy plastic it is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked overlaps and has threads hanging in several places this shower cap went directly in the garbage	14
0	this item is advertised as boufant and oversized it is anything but the shower cap is so tiny it would fit on a grapefruit this kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line	14
0	what a waste of money not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy really cheap plastic	14
0	this mister is not for continuous use had it for only 2 days and the bubbler weakened and barely gave out a mist but good as a lighting decor and ambience	14
0	the friend who i purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too fast for her to keep up with she is used to a two wheeled walker but wanted one with a seat she did n't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund it turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund so she did n't return it the lesson better buy local if you 're not sure	14
0	after one year of owning this scale i replaced the batteries and it stopped working	14
0	this product is not good at all i had to return mine after only 2 weeks i found out that it is really inaccurate and it does n't work when you want it to as for as the body fat percentage i could n't even get it to work do not buy this product	14
0	too difficult to program have had 2 weeks and still have notbeen able to complete process instructions stay on screentoo short a time all i am able to get is weight cannot seeother information on screen unless on floor and right on topof it would send back but too much of a hassel and expense too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my currentweigh	14
0	i ordered the ergo lounger when i arrived i was shocked to find that i could barely lift the box that it came in i wanted to move it to another room to unpack this was supposed to be lightweight aluminum but the box clearly said steel i did not want one that would rust because i intended to carry it to the beach to use it i actually called the manufacturer \( they provided a toll free number \) several times never did they answer the phone nor did they ever return any of my calls so i could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not the lounger itself seemed pretty nice just too heavy and probably would rust soon	14
0	this is an overpriced under designed lounger the concept is cool the product is not the idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses very uncomfortable i am glad i bought mine from amazon as opposed to the 200 plus other retailers wanted last summer	14
0	the original glide was made by \( or used \) gore tex material the photo for this product showed the logo for gore tex the product shipped was the product now marketed by crest no mention of gore tex the crest product is vastly inferior to the original gore tex	14
0	before the very first filter ever even finished it started to crack all over cheap produc	14
0	broke after two uses not worth the time to put back together	14
0	while one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool the manufacture has indeed done so the spoon portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil i supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility but instead of using a fastener or weld its just rolled metal inserted into the coil after only two uses the spoon came out of the coil and even though i could easily enough put it back together after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now would recommend buying a more simply designed single piece shoe horn	14
0	i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star the main problem i had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department i swear it was like bathing in gatorade and while i'm sure that axe was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory but the smell is far too fragrant and if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality think again i was a lot happier with snake peel	14
0	i ordered this and while i'm a fan of other therabeads products i found this poorly designed unless you have a very thick neck the velcro straps are worse than useless they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck and then it did n't cover the neck well	14
0	i ordered the regular size they were to big the smaller size \? too small neither one fit well but both did one thing well hurt the area under my eyes buyer beware	14
0	i ordered this item for my husband and i was extremely disappointed it is poorly made and basically is not worth the money i do not recommend it at all	14
0	sorry to say but this product did not work as promised the black canister does not hold any type or brand of lather can only gel type cans i did call the customer service number and asked why this is and the rep told me that it is a type o on the package in order to use with a lather can you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is the older model product did fit the lather type cans but this one does not sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can you might want to get the older white model the product looks starange when you cant use the black canister as pictured	14
0	the size is good but the second one we ordered leaked the cap did not fit the after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container warmer which costs only 6 10 dollars in the market around too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product	14
0	i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers after using about 5 times it stopped working i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer a little more money but worth the price in the long run	14
0	the very first thing i noticed was how small and crammed the case was it was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something the other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was the bonnnet was difficult to get on mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place and kept pulling the bonnet off my head after a couple of trys and reading the instructions i knew i would never use it simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head whoever designed this product should be demoted	14
0	i purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat the scale part works normal but the body fat measurement is higher by 20 30 compared to tanita bc554 scale or omron hbf 306c hand held omron replaced the unit but the new one is also inaccurate now i'm tying to get my money refunded but omron does not want to take the unit back	14
0	maybe my toenails are just too thick but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them i threw them away upon first use my old toenail cutters were the same design but i do n't know who made them they worked fine heavier duty metal and much sharper these are junk imho	14
0	i have used this product inside my bedroom during the last few months but i have not felt there was any improvement in the air during the winter months i generally get sore throat and an occasionally fever this year nothing has changed since using this product this product is as good as the electric pest repellers	14
0	waking up to this product 's sound and light is delightful trying to read at night by the daylight bulb is not delightful the light is too dim i 've done the things suggested by instructions and other users to no success i must agree that for the price this product should have better sound and quality that leaves us with great idea lousy execution !	14
0	like the fading in of light would like the sound effects if they worked ! out of box the sound effects did not work now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace such a hassle	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
0	out of the box did n't work would not have givin it a 1 star review if there was a zero now its time to play the refund game	14
0	it makes glasses stain and i return it within 1 week	14
0	it looks cool but the mister does n't work the lights are the only thing that worked it is very small too i was very disappointed	14
0	product does n't really do anything more than blow air it does n't appear to do anything with the ultraviolet light	14
0	this stuff smells bad like a mix of medicine and pesticide had to throw it out	14
0	after two months my conclussion was that i could see no change what so ever typically neutrogena is quality but not this time now you ca n't say you were n't warned	14
0	i had great results with this product with the first use however when i used it the second time the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface leaving me with a smooth useless triangle i replaced the triangle thinking i had a dud but had the same thing happen with the second pad the cream will work without the pad but not as effectively if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface they will have a winner with this product on a positive note i love the facial product	14
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet so i bought this specifically for that use i used the triangular pumice attachment only i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate but in general it 's just a vibrating \( 2 levels \) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference the actual machine has no function the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok but can easily be used without this machine	14
0	i explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand my hands are still buzzing from the night before when i used this product i would not recommend this product to anyone else i loved the crystals cream	14
0	i decided to try the caffeine free mega t because i quit caffeine a couple years ago and did n't want a diet supplement with caffeine i only needed to lose 10 pounds took as directed for 1 week also followed the diet and exercise program per the enclosed pamphlet after 1 week to my dismay i actually gained 3 pounds ! i contacted cca industries the company that makes mega t and they promptly informed me that they have a 30 day guarantee and to return them along with my receipt for a refund i shipped them back yesterday i gave a 2 star rating because of cca industries' customer service	14
0	the bath seat was easy to put together and satisfactory to use but some of the metal hardware that was provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust proof and rusted after several weeks of use it makes no sense to make a product used under water that contains metal parts that are not rust proof	14
0	this is an expensive fanny pack not impressed to enough room for diapers etc	14
0	i thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where i do n't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth but contrary to what 's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses which ended up dirtier than they started the wipes work okay on a computer screen though	14
0	i had a wahl clipper pair before it was a good pair of clippers the pair i owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad that was the pair i wanted again the pair i have now does not perform like the previous pair so i'm stuck with the pair ihav	14
0	they have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut my hair is very short and this is unusual if you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out i spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better i would have been better buying a cheap pair at walmart which i normally do	14
0	i searched around for a quite long time before i decide to purchase this model the performance of this clipper is very poor i have to switched back to my old kit to cut my son 's hair very dispointed	14
0	was impressed by the attachments and the how to video but the clippers were of poor quality and pulled on hair rather than cutting it my 5 year old was in tears within 30 seconds of use i returned mine for a refund make sure you test clippers before buying i	14
0	same as the other review the thermometer will not turn on i wo n't change the battery because i do n't think i should have to pay for it if i bought a brand new product i will return it and buy a better thermometer	14
0	health o meter 's proprietary random number generator in a cheap plastic case step on off this scale in rapid succession and you might get the same number twice come back 2 minutes later and you 'll be lucky if you 're within 2 3 pounds of the first number absolute junk	14
0	this is no doubt the worse product i have ever purchased from amazon i would return it or perhaps i should throw in the trash the weight varies if you step on it within a 10 minute interval enormously it is horrible	14
0	ok it does get hot quickly but only when i can get it to turn on after about 6 months the connection to the power switch became loose now i have a hard time getting it to turn on i'm about to buy a different iron with a different type of switch	14
0	i bought this product and the only thing i really gained from it was acne plus my body actually seemed to get flabby once i got off it the acne was gone and my torso looked nicer and more cut would not recommend this to anyone	14
0	i could n't even assemble the product and there were no instructions on how to do so	14
0	i have to say i am disappointed having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916 which i felt gave me a good trim i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon the one i received was much cheaper in quality the plastic guide is cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped the guide shattered there is no replacement for the 5 position guide for the 9916 i can find now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom or finding a razor that can survive real world use on the plus side the battery life on this razor is incredible	14
0	tried this product for 2 weeks it did improve the clarity and softness but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well seemed to have a sticky feel since then i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare this product performs like magic it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush i can do the treatment 2 3x 's a week \( like your supposed to \) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before it is a magical product bette hampton chicago i	14
0	this straightener has been one of the worst i have ever used it did n't straighten at all i had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight it did not stay straight either 60 br 62 waste of money ! ! ! don't buy	14
0	the only thing good about this item is that it is cheap it was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times in the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled frizzy and puffy this straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough	14
0	this straightener is great for thin hair but not for thick i myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy the best hair straighteners out there are about 1 quot thick or less and they normally have glass plates so if you have thick hair spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality	14
0	i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful and it was at a great price but looks can be decieving ! ! this straightener pulls my hair it does n't get very hot it 's kind of uncomfortable to hold and it doesn't straighten my hair ! ! !	14
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products this conditioner \( and i might add shampoo by the same name \) was a real disappointment using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one i'm saving my for lush and frederic fekkai	14
0	well i ordered this iron and recieved a different one ! so how can i rate it mad at amazo	14
0	these bars arrive smashed melting and stale taste like cardboard with dried blueberrie jam spread around on them awfu	14
0	i was very happy with my purchase the company chose to mail it to me via priority mail in order for it to arrive before christmas i was very pleased ! ! ! !	14
0	over time \( 9 months \) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing customer service told me to buy a new one i guess it really is 'all about the money' pass this loser buy a metal body filter	14
0	this device worked about 80 of the time on myself and only about 10 of the time on my father unfortunately it was a christmas gift for him and not for me we ended up getting a self inflating one at circuit city that seems to be working just fine it is possible that the problem lies with him possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at cc worked just fine	14
0	please verify with amazon if they will ship your product i ordered mine 6 weeks back and i havent recieved it till now i wonder when they will send me the same	14
0	results were never consistent many err readings i was definitely no satisfied	14
0	took two pump bottles on a camping trip in the sierras and they leaked terrible ! fortunately i had double bagged them in ziplock bags i was able to spread the leakage on my body by hand which did keep the mosquitos off for hours	14
0	fails at it most basic function to provide a non leaking seal you might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to coverthe top	14
0	all i wanted was a bottle that i could use to mix y protein but this stupid things leaks every time because the lid doesnt fit right you 'd think something with only one purspoe would adequately fill that role well in this case it does n't	14
0	does n't thiss say it all \? screw on threads failed my shake spilled i threw it away and use my martini shaker instead	14
0	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap even if i really tighten it up i still get a small leak when i shake it also the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy but overall it gets the job done and having fluid graduations on the side are nice	14
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it \( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know \) thanks	14
0	shaker is adequate for breaking down whey but it leaks i always have to wash my hands and the outside of the bottle after making anything with it	14
0	this product is great at exfoliating not so great at hair removal your skin will be silky smooth but still have hair the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product	14
0	i did not like this thing at all it took too long to shave my legs it did n't even remove all of the hair it irritated my skin as well	14
0	beware ! this thing even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure as well as not keep it in one spot it took the top layer of skin off ! my poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work ow ! i had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed and what 's worse it did n't take out all the hair i could still see some hair here and there it missed and i thought i got it all i returned it immediately and got a refund on my money never again i 'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead	14
0	i suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review \( which i saw in the description of the product \) was amazon 's idea since most \( if not all \) of the label information is easily found on nature made 's own website www naturemade com there you will find that several of the components are synthetic \( not necessarily bad but i like to know \) and also that amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product ai n't it just amazing what the web can teach you \? thanks amazon ! \)	14
0	i like this hairdryer when it works ! it has broken twice on me the first time it starting spitting out sparks so i sent it back they sent me a new one \( of course i had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back \) and now it only works on low the high is broken i am going to throw it out and get a different brand not impressed !	14
0	i was hopeful that this little product would be up to the job but alas i was wrong it turns out this is a fragile underpowered ineffective tool darn	14
0	worked well five times then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean as per instructions then it would run before cutting but upon trying to edge trim my moustache it would stop immediately as if a single hair could jam it removing head as required for cleaning showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade it appears that this plastic part 's stability shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement a poor design that should n't have used plastic do not bu	14
0	this product was not as i expected it is much weaker than ones used in the past it certainly was not worth the price i paid i returned this item	14
0	i recently purchased this product and i found the motor power to belacking and the tweezer heads dont work as well as the emjoi ap99 aka optima gold the price for these two items are the same so if u want the best for the same money dont get this one get the ap99 model instead	14
0	i ordered this product on june 7th 2006 today is july 11th 2006 and i still have not received it i have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it than to wait over a month for it to show up i'm really not happy with the turn around time for the tide he detergent	14
0	depending on how i shifted my weight even just slightly the scale read different amounts this is normal when the difference is small but the difference was up to 20 pounds ! there was no way to know how much i really weighed ! i called amazon right away to send it back	14
0	i was looking to scent an entire room the lavender is a decent aroma but you need to be within a foot there were no recommendations on how to spread the scent throughout the entire room so i have to believe that this limited range is normal	14
0	i bought this hairdryer and it worked really well for one week but then it just died on me one week	14
0	this hair dryer did dry my hair quickly but it quit working after a month i exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later the buttons were also hard to switch this was a waste of money i ended up buying a completely different hair dryer	14
0	broke after two uses buttons are hard to switch and drying time was not better than my old school model in fact my hair was frizzier i was kinda glad it broke i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this	14
0	after some research online i decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities i was looking for in a lightweight compact model it worked great while it lasted but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it one day it worked and the next day it started smoking and sparking ! !	14
0	i used relacore for one week it did n't work the only thing it helped with was sleeping the bottle says take one with each meal and i did by 3pm daily i was fighting to keep my eyes open if you need help sleeping this is one too take also i put on 3 pounds	14
0	i bought this apple humidifier in early november it stopped working soon at the first time i used it i later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again you have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working i contacted the manufacturer and got replacement however the new one has the same problem and what 's worse it leaks ! ! i talked to the manufacturer again but they did n't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else now i have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do	14
0	we received it with broken cover it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour we tried different ways to make it run but nothing worked we 've returned it it 's just waste of money on the other hand the cow humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well no complaints	14
0	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time then automatically shut off tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail i had to return it however i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great	14
0	this shaver only works on short or fine hair if your hair is long \( more than 1 4 inch \) or coarse it just skips over the hair and does n't do anything i 've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors	14
0	one i started using the shaver it fell apart it has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just do n't work the shaver is a waste of money	14
0	we have only had this showerhead for one month already the nozzles are clogging the spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall do not purchase this product if you have hard water	14
0	ordered 5 allergen covers from this vendor 2 had defective zippers \( would not close after opening \) image the fun of wrestling with your large mattress and then discover the zipper will not close	14
0	would have been better if i actually got this i ordered this and got 6 dr bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back i'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice but i would rather have the hemp tree afraid to order again	14
0	very disappointing the shower head itself is massive the size of a small dinner plate it is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it ca n't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use predictably when you turn on the shower the head drops groundward spewing water in a horizontal spray installs easily but save your money	14
0	of course it works great for as long as it works after some time my unit develped a leak unlike better showerheads the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time causing the seals to not set properly resulting in the kind of leak mine developed unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years i 'd stay away fom this model and good luck navigating watrepik 's website to get any help	14
0	the massager is top heavy and very heavy and will not stay on your hand you will go nuts trying to keep the straps massager secure on your hand	14
0	i have placed the order on oct 9th for 114 95 now on nov 10th amazon is asking me to approve my revised order again for 125 95 i made a mistake when i should have ordered directly from folica i could have used it for a month now ! the 1 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality since i have not used it	14
0	i had a waterpik which started having problems after a year \( planned obsolescence la water who knows \) i bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing i like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small just my opinion \( humble as it may be	14
0	unfortunately total block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin it caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day i do n't doubt this is an excellent sunblock just not for my rosacea sensitive skin i use it now on my arms with no problems i do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase	14
0	this product feels like grain on the face i do n't care for that feel they should improve that other wise i suppose it does the job	14
0	the hair dryer is very heavy also while i like the yellow design of the dryer itself the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool	14
0	the nose trimmer works well but the electric razor not well at all does not cut at all i would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor the cost was a little high for the product	14
0	let me start by saying i think the regular guru energy drink is the best on the market i only wish i could say the same about guru lite there is nothing positive about this drink it is awful ! i was very excited about trying the lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage you might as well take a ginseng or ginkgo biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth if you are big fan of the regular guru stay with it and do n't waste your money on their lite version	14
0	i bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer but its not good first of all it does n't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible \( i have done wax and wax does n't hurt compare to this \) then this is your product other bad thing it produces ingrown hair the horror !	14
0	i have been using an electric shaver for 30 years i have gone through 3 different syles of shavers this past year since my old remington died none of them work well what gives remington \? \? \?	14
0	this razor is not worth the money it did shave pretty well for a few months but the rubber strips wear out really quickly and even though the cleaning option with the fluid seems like a great idea it does not work very well the razor was never clean and refilling the fluid is just a pain i would not recommend this razor	14
0	this product does not work if you have soft blonde hair my hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing it 's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	i was attempting to order aveda brilliant anti humectant pomade but received aveda brilliant humectant pomade the packaging is so similiar did not realize until i opened product that i had the wrong item either you sent the wrong item or i inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging i was being very careful to follow every word so i wonder does aveda srill make the anti humectant pomade i am stuck with the wrong item now that i opened the jar at any rate i am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus i am minus the 22 53 amount spent	14
0	conair just really does not make great hair straighteners i bought the full size one before and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months i have a revlon full size one now \( which works great \) i recently got my hair cut short so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back turn the turbo on blast it up to the highest temperature and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum i have really thin hair and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes this thing cant even straighten that much	14
0	i bought this iron for my teen daughters actually i bought it twice since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping both times it died the first iron lasted about 6 months and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies no warning my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research	14
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact useful size however the rollers take a long time to heat up even if left plugged in for a half hour they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair i would not recommend this product	14
0	the first few days worked great i could not finish eating anything i was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off i work out daily count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day i did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it i did not lose any weight what so ever i think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but do n't expect any weight lost	14

0	i made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it after just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years my face broke out in places it had never broken out before it took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control i would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you	14
0	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them and i could not get the hooks to work i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it and it failed far short of the maximum weight on the package in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures which i had to hang with other hardware	14
0	i had heard that chocoleans were effective but i was very disappointed they taste good but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate i wound up gaining weight while using these	14
0	way too expensive for little in return the same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling	14
0	the sharper image offers a better product which i have been using for about a year but i wanted to try the conair for a little more heat i shaved with the hgm 1 and felt pretty good about it i returned about an hour later and it had emptied an entire can of edge gel \( unplugged \) over the bathroom counter top go with the sharper image product with this little hint ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm up and let it warm up for about 4 5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather	14
0	i thought they might 've improved the hgm 15 model forget about it both models are lousy buy foreign it might work better	14
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots my friend owns one and at first i was envious but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14
0	i purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it i already have the penguin which is also by this company and that one worked perfectly i do n't know if it is because of the design but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running you have to constantly shake it to get it going again obviously a manufacturer error i must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at my kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute but it just did n't work	14

0	i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w o the wet on off feature over this one it does n't clamp down well on my hair \( i 've got thick frizzy hair \) the results for me are n't that great it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy it 's lightweight which is nice i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair i definitely prefer other models over this one	14
0	i read all the reviews thought this would do the trick my daughter does not like the results at all it does not straighted her hair as it states i wish i would have spent a little more on a better one	14
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out not only did it not work for anything it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass also it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener needless to say i 'll be taking this back for an exchange i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair	14
0	i was very disappointed with this product not only did it come in a foreign \( chinese \) box it does n't work well at all the powder that was included actually made it worse if i were you i would keep searching	14
0	this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington beforethis product gives me nothing but trouble	14
0	owned for 2 5 years finaly broken the conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it totaly agree	14
0	i recieved these dead they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged it 's not my charger waste of mone	14
0	original purchase had two dead batteries then a replacement set had the same results it 's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order but the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low made in china	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
0	ewww ewww get it off get it off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omigod i loved hugo so much i 've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well this is just terrible i'm taking a shower look for my posting of this cheap i 've already taken a loss i have reviewed many colognes take a look at them i like most of them	14
0	this item did n't work very well it was n't a close shave at all i used it twice before my dog chewed it up it left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it	14
0	the braun ls 5550 silk soft bodyshave rechargeable cord cordless women 's shaver is absolutely useless not fit for purpose	14
0	save your money you will go over an area several times i went back to my basic razor	14
0	i agree with the reviews from the other reviewers it basically ruined my nails the first time i used it however what i did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed after trimming their claws you often get rough edges i now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short they do n't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet i must state that i will never again use this product for my own nails	14
0	i was very eager to use this product i had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and i thought this would be a great replacement i was a little disappointed when i had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before i could get full power my disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses we can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle i had big hopes for this product but all i got was a big disappoinment	14
0	this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it first of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry if anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work i wish i had spent more and got the sedu since it had very good reviews now i have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened now tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used duh	14
0	i 've used ghds and even though they 're pricier they are worth every penny after using the hai stick just one time i had terrible split ends and the stick did not 'glide' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear terrible ! i think i 'll upgrade	14
0	i bought this product from the discovery channel store and i really want to love it but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after i bought it i returned to the store where i was given a new fountain but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later the mister still works well but the led lights are unpredictable at best	14
0	the flexible arm is not stiff enough to support the dry weight of the showerhead this is the most pathetic product that i have seen in decades	14
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf 203c cascadia showerhead it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal sedondly even with the head made of plastic the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall we installed it repeatedly following each step of the instructions every time thinking we were missing something i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon	14
0	the pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears also it is not sturdy when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position i will be returning mine	14
0	this item worked well for a month or so but then began working intermitently after that eventually it stopped working all together in my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item i would not recommend it	14
0	i had this model or at least it looked the same for a few years and it worked exceptionally well it finally broke down recently and i thought i was lucky enough to find it again but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all actually it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done which of course is like not having it done at all	14
0	i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it	14
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money	14
0	i am a reviewer and i was checking out this 'sleep aid' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product not a review and note that the reviewers have only one review \( click on their 'see all my reviews' \) beware of this shoddy marketing ploy this 'crud' alone merits my one star rating amazon needs to censor these reviews	14
0	now i try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum like in tea i do not drink coffee so when i took stacker 3 \( just one pill \) i was jittery and could not fall asleep i stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day i felt nauseus too now this was probably because i do n't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it but i do n't recommend stacker 3 anyway	14
0	this product must work for some people but obviously not for everyone i started this 1 month ago using it as directed with normal diet regular exercise i 've gained 8 pounds ! on the up side the price was low ordering thru amazon so i would recommend if you 're really interested go ahead try it maybe it will work for you	14
0	within two weeks the hose connection was leaking the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the	14
0	these clic glasses are a great idea i first saw them on csi ny and sought them out but they are not made big enough they worked fine as long as i was looking down but as soon as i turned my head level or looking up the glasses would pop apart i had purchased two pair and returned them both	14
0	bought two of these one as a gift and one for myself luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away this thing just vibrates no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea its not worth 23 99 its a piece of junk trust me you are not getting a bargain i guess you pay for what you get but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub	14
0	i ordered 2 of these only 1 came with the ac plug that was disappointing	14
0	i bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading doing crafts sewing well it doesnt giove off much light either ! ! ! ! so you need another source of light in your work area also i didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful natural light but c'mon all in all its an overpriced night light ! !	14
0	i made my order 5 26 06 and received my order 7 22 0	14
0	terrible reception tinny speaker radio does not remember last used station when turned off do n't waste your money	14
0	cheezy as cheezy can be the only feature i liked was that this item could be returned ! the sound was terrible not easy to tune flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old this thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires mine was promptly returned	14
0	the little radio does not have the ability for station lock in every time it is turned on it reverts to a station set at the manufacturer since there are no indicators or displays it is annoying and time consuming having to constantly reset the station \( s \) it also has lousy reception and lots of static can be heard when the radio is on	14
0	i would have given it zero stars but that is not an option it stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception it was difficult to get a station and it was not a problem with the batteries run do n't walk away from this	14
0	does n't show you what station you are listening to it starts over at 88 9 every time you shut it off by the time you scan a few stations it stops getting a signal and you have to start off at 88 9 again	14
0	my girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday he wo n't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on we can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it the main reason he quit listening is because after i spent time trying to set the station in the morning during his shower the station would automatically change to another one give me a break ! this is a worthless radio it does n't even deserve 1 star	14
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head another thing they did not look cool at all they were ridiculous looking nothing like the photoshopped pictures	14
0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
0	i first bought the standard and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well i used them riding a bike in the winter months neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering \( and prevent tearing \) causes great pressure above the ear the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists	14
0	i'm sorry that i ordered these online i should have tried them first they do not fit round heads no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit the bow needs to have an adjustment too the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off would not buy another pair	14
0	i bought the goggles and was excited by the look they are kind of riddick like they had disappoiinting performance when i rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face they did float and so i found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened i gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing they definately are not for extreme sports they are also too big for casual use as sun glasses	14
0	i lovelovelove dark chocolate \( and other strong pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer \) but these taste just plain wierd it 's not terrible but i can taste the hoodia sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate i think they work at reducing hunger but they give me gas so bad i ca n't be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia or the gas maybe i 'll try the regular chocoleans but i wo n't be buying this again fyi i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix i have no problems with that tastes great works great and no gas !	14
0	i bought myself this book light after giving someone a 5 robotic book light from walgreens when she used hers it lit up the room when i got mine today i tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on it is flimsy the light is dim and it 's not worth the wait go to walgreens instead mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can	14
0	hello i recently bought this blood pressure monitor it functions all well but it gives incorrect readings i mean the readings vary significantly not once twice but many many times i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings purchase this at your own risk my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors atleast u will know that the readings r genuine and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings take care and stay healthy	14
0	it felt nice when my head and neck were resting on the real ease but the device failed to relieve the tension in my upper back and neck \( past the time i spent lying on the device \) i'm about 6' tall	14
0	i purchased this product for my husband for christmas he has been in two car accidents and has migraines we thought this might help it does n't he feels very uncomfortable in fact my mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either in fact if you are short as my mother and myself are it does n't do anything for you	14
0	i placed the order on feb 28 but did not receive the package even on april 12 i called the customer service and was told that the item has never been shippped while i do not receive any information about that moreover the customer service even do n't bother to say sorry	14
0	i purchased the product used it for 2 days and it has not worked since the compnay has yet to respond to my request for return and amazon excepts no liabilty needless to say i wasted money	14
0	this is the classic original round stick old spice deodorant formula and now i realize that it is really dated the formula has n't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms if you want the great smell of old spice then just use the after shave and cologne but stay away from the old stick deodorant i 'll continue to use the old spice high endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas scents and work much much better	14
0	i bought this based on patricia 's review and loved it for the first month then noticed it making a strange sqeaking noise upon closer inspection i noticed multiple welds breaking \( i'm 185 lbs \) now i'm not so happy with it no warrenty amazon wo n't take it back good thing i have a friend with a wire welder who can fix it for me	14
0	absolute waste of money i bought this for my 13 year old as a beginner shaver and it shaves next to nothing ! i do n't know who wrote the other reviews but i doubt they were independent voices this shaver is worthless	14
0	sweeeeeet ! duuuuude ! or so i thought ordered this item in august and still waiting for it my beloved amazon com gets no props on this one	14
0	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks \( as advertised \) i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store \( like i had to eventually do when i ran out \)	14
0	i have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers but this particular brand is horrible the scent is strong and the taste is strong and medicinal there are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent taste upon ingesting only 1 ml of this gripe water my 7 week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited up until then she never vomited before if you want to try gripe water find another brand	14
0	like the reviewer below my dryer also stopped working within a short period it was never dropped or misused after about a month it simply refused to turn on when plugged in now there is a decent warranty for the product however with the money you spend on shipping and the 4 they request for handling return shipping buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal i do n't know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons but since we both found our way to amazon with this review i would n't recommend the product to other buyers	14
0	very simple review the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month then it did n't save your box if you buy this you may need to return it	14
0	this product would be excellent but runs fully 4 too narrow and 3 too short this creates an aprox 2 lip around the entire matress very odd this short coming disturbs the experience substantially the laminated back works well be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine	14
0	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight we returned it to amazon probably the first time we 've ever had to do that for the price it should at least work also in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner it earns two stars for looking great i would not recommend it	14
0	everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles my original pair gave out after three years of use i ordered these because they said standard size they normally come in small medium and large well i am medium and the standard size is large \( same as my husbands \) i had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so i could wear them did not have time to return very disappointed will consider this before ordering from you again	14
0	i ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen the english speaking voice has a british accent and is difficult to understand the scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable especially for someone with impaired eyesight	14
0	the description of the ingredients lists d alpha tocopherol acetate as the main ingredient however the product bottle indicates that the actual main ingredient is dl alpha tocopherol acetate an articial and very different version of the advertised ingredient the amazon com listing is very misleading	14
0	i bought 300 and 500 units they are not working in my small condo i cannot find the place to see how they finally work	14
0	sold as one size fits all but they didn't fit 2 out of 3 people in my house they are tight even on a medium woman 's hand so beware	14
0	not the pumps described even though i tried everything else i found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts	14
0	this is the worst waste of money i have ever had the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups 3x magnification \? \? \? more like 9x ! ! ! you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors my suggestion would be not to waste your money on it its a joke	14
0	so yeah it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups and once it 's mounted it stays put pretty well unfortunately it has so far never actually been fogless get a good shower going and the mirror fogs up in record time splash some water on it and you can see yourself for half a minute but overall this is a disappointment	14
0	i originally planned to purchase locin floss to replace the dentek but i'm not too pleased with it so far pluses each individually wrapped floss does n't contain floride minuses flimpsy handle almost not usable wrap is not 100 sealed flossing head is shallower and narrower than the dentek	14
0	this is a very cheaply built product we had a hard time getting it to mist at all even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at when it did mist it would not get more than about 1 3 inch from the top so the mist never made it out of the bowl we did like the changing color lights	14
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now but i would not reccomend this one	14
0	i tried this deodorant for 2 weeks and it peeled of my skin stay away	14
0	mercury contamination is a very big deal especially if you are going to take a product for life are pregnant or a child many fish oil products have mercury contamination and are not filtered is this product mercury free \? \? so far the only product that was certified mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription	14
0	there is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth this defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth very disappointing	14
0	1500 mgs etc advertised is misleading as 1500 mgs refer to the daily recommended dose contained in two pills honest advertising would quote 750 mgs etc per pill ! i will definitively not purchase any product from that unreliable source i believe amazon should check it 's suppliers with more scrutiny as their misconduct reflects on amazon a generally very reliable ecommerce site nessim	14
0	title says it all it simply does not work yes it turns and trims a hair here and there but i would not purchase this again i am happy with my other wahl product	14
0	this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it i assumed since wahl has a long time history of manufacturing grooming products that this would be a quality item was i ever wrong this trimmer is constructed poorly and does n't cut hair it will be heading to the trash	14
0	this item is garbage i purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me it 's not worth the frustratio	14
0	wo n't even cut hairs you stick directly into the blade the shape and slots of the housing covering the blade would only cut hair that was as dense as a forest and then only if you shoved it in hard	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
0	i will never purchase another neutrogena product again there products are dangerous ! ! ! it burned my face my face is all red swollen red irritated and itchy my new best friend is cortizone 10 the anti itch cream it 's been a week since i stopped using netrogena and i still look horrifying ! ! ! ! perfect for halloween right \? but halloween is over and i still look scary this product has aged me ! ! ! it has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen never again neutrogena ! ! !	14
0	these are the bulkiest leakiest diapers i 've ever used ! even though they do n't have bleach there is still tons of pesticide used in cotton production plus these are n't even made from recycled materials	14
0	do not buy this prouct because it is made of cheap quality and the attachable plastic combs are hard to attach and break very easily the small parts that attach the combs also snapped off without applying much force this product looks like a good value because of the number of accessories but they will be useless when you throwing it out within only two months as i was forced to after all of the parts broke off save your money and avoid	14
0	please careful about this grooming kit i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair also this can not be used for continuous use if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	14
0	i purchase this press and was totally disappointed with this product it takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press than with an iron i will be returning	14
0	i bought this press to do crafts the dimensions i were given were completely wrong i was told the product in inches \( l x w x h \) 9 0 x 20 0 x 15 0 it really is barely 6 1 2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long 17 inces long at the angle it was so small that i could maybe iron one sock at a time also the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website	14
0	please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site or at the very least practice honesty in advertising this unit is so small that all it good for is ties shorts and socks i feel violated by amazon and conair	14
0	i bought this to save time it took me longer to stem press one shirt then ironing by conventional iron it was too small i end up returing it which cost me 25 in shipping cost both ways	14
0	the guy below is right the blades are so far down it wo n't cut anything but really long hairs how could this make it through any product test \? i tossed mine in the garbage	14
0	i like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper so i bought tushies when my baby was newborn they seemed to work ok maybe because she did n't put out that much she is now three months old i practice attachment parenting so i know exactly when she has a bowel movement the past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly she was sitting on my lap she had a bowel movement five seconds later i got up to change her the feces was all over my pants this has happened several times the concept of the diaper is great but the diaper needs some work around the legs	14
0	i do n't know if it works or not i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading	14
0	i bought this item and had it shipped to a friend out of state it never worked she replaced the batteries when it arrived but that did n't help it was a complete waste of time and money	14
0	i recently bought 3 items from this brand lumiscope actually this is the only item that works among them though i am kind of suspicious about it 's inconsistent readings from time to time i think braun irt452 is a much better product which i bought one for my parents in china during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings	14
0	maybe it 's just my bad luck but i ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery i called amazon and they sent me a replacement quickly the thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same not working condition the same problem with the battery i was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item as amazon vendor do n't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers be aware ! do n't waste your time	14
0	contrary to purported performance claims my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of duracell 's products decades of experience with everready energizers and with other duracell products \( e g coppertops \) show procell products to be markedly inferior in performance regardless of how long their shelf life may be they simply have n't performed up to par much less equally to other alkaline batteries this has just been my experience over daily use over many months with set after set of procell aa batteries take it for what its' worth	14
0	i simply love most all of olay products especially the regenerist line until i bought the tone enhancer it did nothing for my face not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin i guess i will use it as a moisturizer until it 's gone	14
0	the product is great i already have the uni lateral one and it rocks so i wanted to buy the bi lateral aka 2 and two times they have sent me uni ones that were labeled as bi so your best bet is to bi 2 uni 's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem	14
0	i 've used the cardiochek 6 times and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200 with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points it is a lot of trouble \( and expensive \) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol hdl cholesterol and triglycerides no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek the box says includes check strips but those are something other than test strips	14
0	i bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips i simultaneously had bloodwork at the doctor 's office when i did the test except for the total cholesterol all the other tests were off the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color the test strips which are expensive were bad i am planning on returning this produc	14
0	i purchased the product found it to be not accurate also in order to get your ldl result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it costly ! ! cumbersome ! ! ! 3 times niddle your fingers ! ! i returned the product	14
0	i bought this for my husband and son and was not even able to give one hair cut it pulled the hair and did n't cut well my husband kept complaining that it hurt and was pulling since i could n't finish i had to use our old clippers to get the job done this was so disappointing but i guess you get what you pay for	14
0	does not cut hair cleanly ends up pulling at hair and requires multiple passes	14
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products this conditioner \( and i might add shampoo by the same name \) was a real disappointment using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one i'm saving my for lush and frederic fekkai ! gail cook	14
0	this cannot be the real thing the scent does n't last 5 minutes what a waste of 50 00 i am so disappointed	14
0	i have never used such an impactless \( if that is a word \) product there is absolutely no effect whatsoever not even remotely it is simply a waste of money and bottle i am terribly disappointed you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect	14
0	horrible just like tend skin try princereigns or min they actually work and dont burn your face off like tend skin or magic shav	14
0	i bought this pricey little bottle of lens dr hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake ! it did nothing but make it worse ! after i saw what it did to the lenses i had to scrape and scrub to get it off ! i hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product a big rip of	14
0	this product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised there are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries i do not recommend this ! just get new glasses	14
0	if i had saved the box i would have returned this product the head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked and it wasnt just one shower i tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes	14
0	while the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good this pillow is too small to do an adult much good it is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose it could be perfect perhaps for a child	14
0	you truly get what you pay for what more can i say	14
0	the description says slipcover zips off for easy cleaning but the product did not come with a slipcover the pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern now i have to find a slipcover that wo n't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath	14
0	please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it i have used the panasonic es8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time i use it stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine it 's like french kissing jaws the worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi shaving will remove seriously this must be one of those devices left over from the spanish inquisition	14
0	this thing messed up my back it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it furthuremore it smells terrible do not buy this product you will regret it \( shipping was n't bad	14
0	i bought this from qvc it will do the trick for quick touch ups not close hair removal but close enough unfortunately mine is barley operating anymore even with a fresh battery i'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long as a result i think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well	14
0	i bought this from qvc after i had to send back a braun silk epil the epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness waxing just hurts too much and is really messy this sounded ideal i just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks and upper lip it trims down your facial hair however the next day you will notice stubble you have to really look close to see it but you can really feel it you might as well shave i have not used the brow attachment i saw the demo on qvc but am afraid i will shave my brows off would love to know what others think of this item	14
0	this hair dryer was purchased as a christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years i could not locate one locally so i order from amazon the dryer only worked for a few days nothing i do will make it work again the reason i have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much	14
0	nothing but problems with unit since i received it either it did not work when i went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again never had the same weight reading twice ! the only reason i rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less	14
0	at christmas 2003 i was very excited with the 50 scale my family purchased for me it worked as advertised for about six months then it displayed the err message more and more we replaced the battery then it would not permit any function buttons to perform we just sighed and used my expensive gift as any 7 bathroom scale when it went completely blank this week battery of no use i hopped on the internet to see what anyone else 's experience is to be fair i will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right i hope they can if not i will see what the weight watchers scales is like sigh	14
0	after reading several comments i tried to proof my scale is working properly however like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant i weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings like some one else i even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands the scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight now ! a digital scale is supposed to be percise	14
0	first of all the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not when i bought a 9 volt battery and installed it it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment finally i got a read out and entered my height and age then i stood on the scale and got nothing no weight no body fat nothing but the word error at which point i boxed it up and sent it back for a refund	14
0	i bought a pack of 3 and used twice daily in the shower to try and clear my oily skin problems this product left my skin dry and sometimes peeling did not work for me but it might work for you	14
0	i used it one time placed it on the charger and it never worked again now i face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair not happy with my internet purchase from your company	14
0	i know that this product works for some but for me it did not that is why i decided to return it wahl makes great products but this product was not for me my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it	14
0	i had this for about 2 years and was not impressed it worked for a month or so and since then does nothing if you fill it up with water and then plug it in for several days the water level never goes down i 've tried cleaning it repeatedly and tried various things to make it work but apparently it 's just dead it was a cheap product you get what you pay for	14
0	i just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition however after setting it up i added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water no cascading sound i added more water nothing i added less water absolutely nothing the design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise it is useless from that perspective plus you can tell it is made of plastic so it is n't really that nice to look at either i would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use	14
0	this item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs i am tall with a 37 inseam this item is not made for someone who has longer than average legs unless you 're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage	14
0	this item is very heavy and bulky descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the kneading action as well as your calves however that is not the case your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too the kneading pressure can not be regulated only the speed the kneading pressure is very intense and can be very uncomfortable at times if my massage therapist ever worked like this i would fire immediately i tired to like it however quickly returned after a few days	14
0	if you get it wet it stops working which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush if you want something to work for a month or two its fine otherwise avoid it entirely i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture pretty quickly after ordinary use	14
0	i have bought this product and i have gained 5lbs it didnt worked on me i guess you just have to try the product i just ordered hoodoba on amazon and hoping that will work hoodoba has good ratings	14
0	since our bathroom cabinet is short on space i loved the idea of this hair dryer ! unfortunately the idea was more a fantasy than a reality i only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord keeper button fell out \( spring and all ! \) and the retractible cord stopped retracting since that was the only reason i bought this one over other models i was sorely disappointed ! also this dryer is so l o u d that i had to wear earplugs \( no kidding ! \) while drying my hair so that i would n't damage my hearing ! hands down the worst hair dryer on the market	14
0	it worked fine for 2 3 weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my short hair and it would just stop i had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together very frustrating go get a professional dryer it might cost a bit more but it 'll work ! and probably for a long time	14
0	i loved ths retractable cord hair dryer when i first bought it about a year ago now it 's starting to stop running it appears to be a short in the power cord in the inclosed casing when i'm using it it works then it stops then i shake it and then it starts to work again sometimes my last hair dryer lasted over 20 years they just do n't make products like they use to for this price i should n't expect much i guess you really do get what you pay for ! this hair dryer is perfect to take on an airline if it 's not allowed on the plane and they throw it out who cares	14
0	i have used three of these the first two each lasted a year before shorting out i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function this last one though shorted out and started a fire i have notified the company and will see what happens but i doubt that i will purchase another it 's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market	14
0	i bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair when it gets hot it would stop good thing i did n't throw it away this cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months it is also very loud ! almost hurt my ears to use i	14
0	having owned several panasonic wet dry shavers over a 20 year period i can with authority say that this model is a big disappointment the battery life is outstanding but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor the next time i wo n't pinch pennies the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference	14
0	the scale is already broken it just reads lo when you step on it and i just got it a couple of weeks ago it worked for about a week and a half	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
0	this one is too small for a bedroom just like a toy i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701 000 ultrasonic humidifier which is much bigger generally speaking the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones	14
0	i bought this scale as an upgrade from a wal mart cheapo scale hated it ! ! i should have read the dimensions more carefully but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom worse still it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again returned the item but ate the 11 return ship fee it 's huge and heavy	14
0	when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs also this is a big scale too big to store in the bathroo	14
0	these wipes clean well they arrived promptly they stink something fierce i cannot stand the way they smell	14
0	did not work at all i used cheaper products that i bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them since princereigns promised to be a miracle product i bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them complete waste of money	14
0	sturdy enough for the price but no power replaced original battery with a new duracell still fuctioned like the battery was drained like i mentioned before what do you expect for the price	14
1	i 've found the omron very easy and practical to use it gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and bmi \( body mass index \) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program for the money it would be difficult to find something better	14
1	i 've been using the omron hbf 306 body fat analyzer for a month or so now so far i 've been very impressed with its consistency however i would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the omron 's measurements to see how accurate it is it 's well built and very easy to use once you set up your profile it only takes a few seconds to get a read i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with still a good product at a good price	14
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom \( same brand and model \) is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall	14
1	pedometer is great ! easy to use accurate highly recommend it	14
1	this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had my kids love them too great high energy snack	14
1	i really like these things they 're certainly chewy so they can be a bit of a jaw workout but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar and they keep you going for a couple of hours if only they were a little cheaper say a dollar or less per bar i 'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than i do right now	14
1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer i found it easy to use and accurate however after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor and that was it it no longer works i will probably buy another one but it needs to be treated with kid gloves	14
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time	14
1	i bought this product because i had a borderline high reading at my doctor 's office rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop pay just to have it monitored we purchased this unit it works wonderful very simple and gives more information than i expected	14
1	this is very easy to use and quite convenient i'm not sure however how accurate this monitor is it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's	14
1	this has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use it really does n't start until your arm is in the correct position letting you know by beeping when you 've got it right the display is large and easy to read and understand i definitely would recommend this	14
1	very happy with this purchase received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an credit card it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings	14
1	these bars are absolutely fantastic they are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein \( 20g \) they taste pretty good far better than most bars i prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream next being the peanut butter and then chocolate a chocolate mint flavor has just been released but i have yet to try it i recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out	14
1	just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived melted as noted by another reviewer i ended up placing in the fridge and then taking out before eating turns out i did n't find them that great directly from the fridge also they just did n't taste as fresh as the ones i buy individually from wal mart i could n't tell if that was because they had melted or just were n't as fresh to start with	14
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks \( amazon of course took it back with no problems \) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher the numbers on it are very large and easy to read also it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita i ca n't wait to try all the features by the way i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied 2 lbs as promised great deal for the money ! ! !	14
1	i recently started weight watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale i figured i would buy a ww product but after reading the reviews i decided to go with the omron scale i am very pleased with this product it has been extremely accurate it keeps a history for both my husband and i i would highly recommend this scale to anyone ! it is also an attractive scale which is a bonus go with the omron scale	14
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	the cherry covered choccolate luna bars are quite tasty chances are if you 're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar you need a little enticement to eat healthy like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day i recommend alternating between these and another bar that 's not so sweet \( kashi trail mix bars are perfect \) that helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop	14
1	this monitor is so easy to use and more convenient than going to the grocery store it saves the readings in memory so if i do n't have a pen and paper handy i can retrieve the info later it even shows the time the reading was taken	14
1	this blood pressure monitor is everything i was looking for and the price was certainly right thank you it works perfectly	14
1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectivelythank you so muchbimvik	14
1	unbeatable for the price ! worked fine right out of the box easy to use and easy to understand instructions i'm glad i bought it	14
1	my physician introduced me to this item he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods is affordable and easy to use oh did i forget to mention accurate compaired to a scale model i own amazon is great to order from the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !	14
1	my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers \( size 3 \) from 4 month old it is soft and my baby never have rush with it my whole family love this diapers	14
1	i encountered these at last week 's carlsbad triathlon they tasted really good and i figured if it 's good enough for the military i 'll give it a try sure enough the military knows what it 's doing it seems to work as claimed thumbs up or hooah	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14
1	out of the 3 flavors available this one is the favorite of both my boys \( 4yrs and 7yrs \) but no matter what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy !	14
1	i came across the hooah drink because my boss a retired military man running for office always has a case lying around with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long these are invaluable for getting me through the day and keeping my thoughts coherent apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent i ca n't measure that in myself of course but i do sense a dramatic improvement	14
1	this is a great drink i wanted to try something that was different and this definately fit in it isnt carbonated and tastes really good what i really wanted to know though was how it worked there is no caffeine or taurine and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary it worked well though and i was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it	14
1	this shaver has met all my expectations it cleans and recharges itself automatically the shave is close and nick free the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes	14
1	my husband said it is a very good shaver it took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has always used the norelco shavers with three rotating heads the braun is a closer shave the cleaning system works very well and it is easy to handle	14
1	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate but it takes a while for it to give a reading the first few times i used it it took over a minute to tell me my pulse however the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster so far this is true as within the last 3 days i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently considering the price it was a good purchase	14
1	if you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback this is the product to buy packaging support presentation and hardware software quality are the best that i have seen no down side it 's not a game in the usual sense more of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way there is room for a little mischief instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly i tried busting a few type a personality shows through occasionally i will be purchasing the next item in the series i am learning to relax at will which will be helpful in my high stress occupation good luck	14
1	i have had so much fun learning bio feedback and learnig to breath the exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation i highly recommned this product i will be purchasing the add on in the near future	14

1	very compact with good instructions comes with a very durable case and handle which makes it easily portable i hope i never have to use it	14
1	the toothbrush is great feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned	14
1	the toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads if you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex your teeth suffer the oral b head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth you can i have not had a cavity in years my pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed if only these woked on abs	14
1	these are a great yuumy snack for someone who counts calories \( or points \) it 's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great ! i have never met a luna bar i did n't like though this is my favorite flavor	14
1	these are very tasty they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you they also are great in a diaper bag purse center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination	14
1	they do n't seem small at all i would agree that it 's like a size 3 if you 're talking about toddler clothing but the diaper size is different my daughter wears 3t clothes size 5 easy ups	14
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we 're yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it 's been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor	14
1	this blood pressure monitor is easy to use and works great	14
1	if your looking for a bar that hits the spot without leaving you wanting more this is the bar for you provides great flavor and satisfies i highly recommend this bar for in between snacks not to high in fat has more carbs than other protein bars but is a great overall ba	14
1	we love this item ! ! ! we get older tv show dvds from netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come if the cleaner does n't work and it generally does our back up is the repair stuff which almost always does i think out of 30 disks only two were not fixed	14
1	this book is beautiful outside i love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front what i do not like is how there is no specific places to write in you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page too much like scrapbooking for me i wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in for example one blank page will say all about mom then another that says baby shower etc but the pages are blank i need more structure	14
1	this is the 3rd or 4th time i have bought this type of batteries and i am always satisfied with their performance they are a great value	14
1	this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had my kids love them too great high energy snack	14

1	this is the only energy bar that i have sampled more than once ! the hooah ! energy bar works faster lasts longer and tastes better ! both flavors ! go army !	14
1	compared to the energy bars on the market these days \( cliff powerbar etc \) that taste terrible hooah bars are awesome they really work too energy wise great for long bike rides triatholons etc or even something to eat before practice for athletes they are awesome i am a huge fan	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14

1	this omron blood pressure monitor is ok but not as good in my opinion as my old one from the same company this one does n't print out results although it does store them also the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome	14

1	nowhere else in this country can you get this quality accuracy and convenience at this price fda approved and ncep certified and the entire cholesterol panel no other at home test can make those claims as for my results they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor 's office why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor 's office when amazon com makes this superb biosafe test available to any customer i'm recommending it to all my friends buy one today ! or better yet 2 get one for a friend	14
1	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it from a novice 's point of view this is a great meditation aid i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack	14
1	necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary braun electric toothbrush i foung amazon com 's price for this item cheaper than costco or sam 's club ! ! !	14

1	the biosafe thyroid test is accurate and simple to use the results came back in less than a week and matched my doctor 's results ! thanks biosafe	14
1	yes the kit is easy to use but if you do n't bleed freely get a few extra lancets before you start most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free the kit only comes with two \( which can be used only one time \) it took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test i had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets \( because i'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool \) other than that no complaints the lab got the results back to me faster than expected	14

1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer i found it easy to use and accurate however after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor and that was it it no longer works i will probably buy another one but it needs to be treated with kid gloves	14
1	great product easy to use and simple to follow instruction keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks i recommend it to anyone it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do buy it wear it be happy	14
1	i have had omord hr 100c for a few months now i use it wile on my treadmill it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand the hr 100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor	14
1	great product for the i spent i picked it b c i can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my budget it does jump around more than i 'd like but i can tell from the range that i am over or under my target heart rate it does beep to let you know that but i find it annoying so i turn it off if you find you have trouble getting it to register your rate then move it around a bit mine works best when i put it higher on my chest in the area of my heart just below my shoulder blade	14
1	this is a great product easy to program and use easy to read digital display and very accurate	14

1	it is really good enough for my need i have no problems so far	14
1	i eat one of these twice a week before i play ice hockey i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine though i do n't perceive any boost it could be there and i'm just not noticing it i feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout it would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the clif bar i find the size of a clif bar a bit disappointing especially considering the store price of 1 50 at 11 a case and with free shipping when spending 25 or more i 've not found a better price than amazon 's on clif bars	14
1	i have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down as other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base it makes dry shaving extremely smooth as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess you can use this with any type of electric not just remingtons and it 's very easy to clean out just tap it out and or blow and or brush highly recommende	14
1	i bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product she personally like the product and really good	14
1	this was a perfect fit for my healthy lifestyle ! what i found also very helpful was getyoursexyon myarbonne com it was the only thing that i never thought would be missing from trying to be healthy everyday guess there 's enough people vouching for my all time fav cliff bars so i wanted to spread the word i know i wish i would have found out sooner !	14
1	i really liked the outside design of the book a lot of books were cartoonish and really was drawn to the look of the book i wish the book did not have so much random fill in pages i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events ages of the child but all in all i am pleased with it i would most likely buy again	14
1	my physician introduced me to this item he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods is affordable and easy to use oh did i forget to mention accurate compaired to a scale model i own amazon is great to order from the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !	14
1	usefuleasy to usegood pricei would recommend this product	14
1	it does what it advertises the bodyfat readings do fluctuate but that 's normal it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low normal high too high i got it for about 25 bucks so good buy	14
1	very handy that you can put it in your handbag wherever you go you can use it to read those tiny words in the label when you are grocery shopping better than magnifier glass because the width of this bookmark covers the whole line of a page	14
1	i own an older dispensor from around 1999 and i was afraid that these filters would n't fit they do and seem to work fine i ca n't find a replace indicator on these new ones the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis they say the filters are good for 2 months	14
1	i was very suprised at how small the units were \( i ordered 2 \) but they work great and run very quietly the filter is very easy to change i have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that i switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space i would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money	14
1	i called nature made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury their fish oil is usp tested for purity and potency there is n't any mercury free fish oil however nm contains only 01 mcg g of mercury very low level and certainly not toxic i'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently fyi they have a great website that contains all this information	14

1	i bought calvin klein for women parfum as a christmas gift to my sister to see the smile on her face at christmas when she opened her gift was priceless as for the cost it was much less than the department stores at the local mall 's thank you amazon for a great deal !	14
1	i love these luvs ! they are remarkably thin easy to pull out of the wipe warmer yet still very durable and pliable however they are also remarkably difficult to find locally so buy in bulk when you can find them	14
1	these wipes are just as soft and durable as pampers but much less expensive ! they are not alcohol free unfortunately though i have noticed that those wipes which are alcohol free contain citric acid \( fyi \) quick free delivery	14
1	i suffer from upper back and shoulder tension i 've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one i had after looking at many warmers i chose the happy wrap the wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles my yorkshire terrier ca n't wait until i'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when i'm finished	14

1	my grandfather found a vial of old spice in his navy kit when he joined in 1943 he continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age i began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious old spice is conservative and masculine distinct and time honored it 's not a trend it 's a statement of manhood if proctor amp gamble obliges my own grandkids will be using it	14
1	i am so happy with this product i have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach if i eat too late at night or eat the wrong thing i just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night	14
1	this is a great barber style setup it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case they even give you a garbage bag good dea	14
1	this product does make the appetite disappear ! ! however it made me very irritable while i took it i took it for four days so i did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked the pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation everyone is affected differently when taking things so i would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away	14
1	27 ounces is a nice size the bottle is light \( can be dented \) and water stored in it tastes very good and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy ! another reviewer mentioned a squeal that would be while twisting the cap on or off i 've gotten used to that wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my toyota cupholder that may not be an issue with toyotas that are newer than mine are \( 10 15years \) in the car on the nightstand in the canoe or kayak it 's working for me	14
1	we love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more power than our old brush	14
1	i purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters it 's a great brush head for pediatric \( and adult \) mouths they swap out the heads it 's rechargeable and i can stop purchasing junky kids battery operated toothbrushes every 1 2 months after the batteries wear down i have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build up	14
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer it never brushed well the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly i just never felt i was getting a good brush after using this brush for about a couple of months i went in for a regular checkup my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better that 's all the testimony i need	14
1	i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth it 's a bit louder than the older model probably because it 's got an additional motion and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light overall just what we wanted	14
1	daughter was very pleased when she received it unexpectedly after her good news ! she 's very picky also just loved the quality and organizational value of the set ! very nicely packaged would highly recommend	14
1	i love this product it is so well worth the money if you 're experiencing a skin problem easy to use portable no lotions or creams needed just my little leather case	14
1	heats up fast rolls up easily \( does n't slip like old school hot rollers used to \) and stays on with the right hot roller clips depending on the look i'm looking for i use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin length fine hair keep them on for 10 minutes while i put on my makeup and voila ! soft strokeable voluminous hair	14
1	i use these almost every morning they 're hot and ready to go in seconds i like the nonslip surface of the curlers makes it so easy to set my hair remove and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style i like having 12 large rollers to handle my thick long hair these rollers rock	14
1	the lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft absorbant and they dry quickly the diva darling hair towels are not quite as nice hair turbans stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big fluffy towel if the turban gets sopping wet that means it 's doing its job ! my parents taught me it 's impolite to come to breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair this turban is not only great at home but also in college dorms	14
1	this product works well it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going	14
1	always saw them at the mall and wanted one it was nice to be able to get it on here and not have to search works great ! feels wonderful ! ! ! especially when you get that headache ! ! ! also doubles as a contemporary hat ! ! haha love it	14
1	i love the tingler ! each metal tip feels great i personally like the copper version a little better than the silver version it 's a little gentler and softer but i know some people find it too soft and like the silver version instead before the tingler sometimes i would use one end of my glasses \( the end that fits over the ear \) but of course my glasses are fragil and i would risk damaging them it also feels really good on the back and actually all over not just on the head	14
1	i am totally satisfied with thids product so far of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few charges i will be dissatisfied i expect them to last tens of reusses if experience can be of any guideline	14
1	great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot the plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit yet the plastic will off gas works best on couch while watching tv movies for anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out i highly recommend this to help get you back into shape	14
1	i have fought with my naturally curly crazy hair for all of my life i have tried more products that i care to mention but i do love this product ! it truly delivers what it promises frizz free loose non stiff curls ! i just get out of the shower towel dry very lightly put it on and voila ! makes my curls looks sexy !	14
1	i love this product its the first one i 've found where i can practically have wash and go curly hair just put work it through damp hair and let it air dry or twist around fingers for defined curls	14
1	i'm sixty years old and i have been using this product for years when i had my yearly physical the doc ask me if i used anything because my skin looks so good roc delivers ! ! !	14
1	clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you your family and the enviroment	14
1	i love the this set expecially the nail cutter i m still using mine after six years	14
1	i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist it works for me but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing brushing and generally good tooth care	14
1	i love this everyone can have their own data and we can track our own progress it is very simple to use and the explanations are clear	14
1	great enginering design and craftmanship works great every day but i had to throw away a travel size waterpick after 18 months because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else it does n't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part on an equipment designed to outlast it three times	14
1	i use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool i purchased works great !	14
1	this simple scale is light easy to carry and store i tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale it read the same weight but actually with less flucuation when i shifted on it i was careful to keep it on a flat surface i had good luck on old hardwood floors less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom it was very consistent on a level surface i tested it several times in a row with the same reading and various times throughout the day nothing read unusually i really like the form factor of this scale it 's so small not small spacewise but just thin light with a nice solid place to plant your feet	14
1	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer i would recommend this hair dyer	14
1	good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu	14
1	i bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head its very easy to clean and does a great job	14
1	very nice trimmer my hat off to remington i have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard it words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers	14
1	this is the best and easiest to use back brush ! i have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just did n't do it but with this brush no more missed spots just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time never felt so clean	14
1	since having back problems especially waking up in the morning this lumbar extender works wonders for my back i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks b	14
1	it is not one of the stain removers which instantly gets rid of the stain so when you spill over something over your t shirt you got to spill this tide stain remover on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with stain but its not an immedieate relief solution	14
1	this product is so good for you i sprinkle it on my cereal salads in yogurt etx a nice nutty flavor and the health benefits are outstanding i highly recommend this product	14
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving and when it does it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving i do n't think it hurts much though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily i am very happy with this product	14
1	i boutght this razor for my husband he likes it but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers which he seems to miss a lot i think that if he shaved more carefully he would get these whiskers before they get too long ! i think that for the price \( lower end of price range \) it does a pretty good job next time i 'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better	14
1	this stuff is awesome for hangovers it was like my high school staple ! i mean i went through like a box a week at least give it a try	14
1	my husband tried this after i bought it and he loves it it is a great remedy for a hangover or even just a bad morning it is very hard to find in most drugstores now i just buy it on the internet i 've even recommended it to friends who now swear buy it	14
1	i love this product ! i deal with a lot of stress \( dont' we all \) and was feeling edgy and nervous all the time i couldnt' even enjoy my grandkids since i started taking calm advantage those feelings are gone and i can relax and enjoy life again i would definately recommend it to anyone	14
1	bought this for my husband who has a 2 hour \( one way \) commute by bus to work he loves it now he can nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck it is very portable with a small carrying case and is easy to blow up a bargain for the price	14
1	great product the girls had a blast with it real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair not all the time though still a fabulous product would highly recommend it my niece wishes it came with more gems	14
1	this is great my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems	14
1	my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing smoothing products they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth my hair is very fine but also thick \( which is very annoying \) this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down it seems very expensive for such a small bottle but a little goes a long way \( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished \) definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming	14
1	shaving cream in a tube is just about impossible to buy at retail outlets this is a great product and i will continue to buy it through amazon	14
1	there is no better shaving cream i am disappointed you are out of stock	14
1	it doesnt quit dark circles but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face	14
1	for any one who loses their reading glasses or does n't know where to put them these glasses work great the magnet is strong and the glasses comfortable this is especially true on the beach they are what they claimed to be	14
1	these seem to be an excellent product there is little or not leakage the wipes were a nice treat	14
1	i ordered these disposable pampers for my son they are great i ordered them and recieved free 2 day shipping	14
1	these are by far the best newborn size diapers especially for small babies but if you order them through amazon your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive ! i waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1 which actually arrived in a few days ! update i have ordered pampers again through amazon \( different size \) and they shipped right away	14
1	i lost six pounds in eleven days i started out taking one half pill in the morning and one half in the afternoon i was wary of any reaction i now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon that 's enough for me i have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise no side effects whatsoever my problem was the munchies at night watching tv and that craving is gone i highly recommend this product	14
1	that 's the only way i can rate this product if it taste great then it gets a high rating from me	14
1	it seems to be doing the job my next dental check will tell it 's a little awkward at first getting used to the brush \( quite a bit different from the conventional brush \) and i think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only \( thumb and forefinger \) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline and i still do find a little tartar on my teeth so you decide	14
1	great tooth brush my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked bette	14
1	it takes some getting used to but once you do you will love it it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush electric or other that i have ever used you feel at first like it is totally strange \( it is ! \) does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else i have no buyers remorse i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle	14
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past shoulder length hair it works great ! i gotta admit it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the extra large size towel \( which is n't really all that large	14
1	these are marvelous ! ! i had gotten a different style last february for mothers these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids i love the snap strap and the pouch now all of my children want them too ! ! also love the up to date colors !	14
1	this water jet is excellent it allows you to have a separate chamber for water and mouthwash it also comes with different attachments for your gums teeth and tongue excellent product at an excellent price	14
1	i have used this supplement for more than five years at the suggestion of a herbalist i have never felt better not only does it seem to help keep those colds away it seems to keep me more health feeling and less tired	14
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase of the wooden foot roller massager it gives you a relaxed feeling for sore and tired feet i discoverd that if you turn it on the other side you can also use it on your arms and legs by holding it	14
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she is able to do her nail easily the nail attachments work really well and strong the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone compact size easy to store and quick charge time	14
1	these are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare great product	14
1	upon recommendation from other consumers i purchased these rollers i travel a great deal for my job and get aways with my husband the rollers heat up well and are compact i just keep them in my suitcase all the time so i'm ready to go	14
1	my husband is very pleased with his self cleaning razor although he did n't like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs it 's an excellant appliance	14
1	i purchased this for my husband he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation	14
1	when i found out that contradiction was no longer going to be sold in the us i thought i would never find this again it 's my boyfriend 's favorite cologne and i was determined to find it thanks to amazon he has his sexy scent back lo	14
1	best hair dryer ever i have long thick curly frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x my hair is shiny and soft the diffuser is also amazing i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz by far the best dryer out there in this price range granted it 's heavy but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones \?	14
1	this is a great product a friend told me about it i finally decided to get one i had bleeding gums in two weeks of regular use bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great just be careful when using the water jet side you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth or it will spray all over the place	14
1	great and accurate it is a pleasure to use best monitor available	14
1	i have dry course hair that certainly gets even drier in the colorado climate i have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair i can see if you had fine hair that this product would not be a good thing ! i always have to remember that it 's the anti humectant that i like not the humectant the humectant version does nothing for my hair and i have purchased it on occasion by mistake this stuff smells great too ! makes styling a snap	14
1	i am very happy with the emjoi compact epilator that i purchased it does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully until i asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair i did n't even know something like this exhisted i just wish i would have known about this product years ago a davis	14
1	very classy scent very strong spray sparingly a little goes a long way lasts all day will receive many compliments	14
1	i purchased this for my wife for christmas and she loves it as do i it is n't too 'perfume y' and smells terrific	14
1	exactly what i wanted works perfectly the flosser at the bottom the head of the toothbrush is great at getting between the teeth charges quickly and is convien	14
1	i use this with my m3 turbo and some kiehl 's closeshavers squadron ultimate brushless shave cream white eagle for my daily morning shave it 's the best combination for thick tough stubble	14
1	i got this for my husband for christmas i had seen it in magazines but it was expensive for this product i thought i was so excited to find it on amazon and he just loves it he shaves in the shower and the mirror never fogs it 's a great product	14
1	i looked long and hard for a heating pad that did not need plugging in or hot water poured into it this is perfect just zap it for two minutes in the microwave and set it where the you need it ahhhh ! pure happiness ! a definite must have	14
1	i like this cutter i can use it by itself or with its accessaries even when the batteries are low i can still nip those little overnight hairs works for me !	14
1	easy to use short time to recharge the baterie long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive skin	14
1	this booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa it is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits you need to put in in the spa while it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on it is a good product	14
1	i 've been using nicads for long long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units gps walkie talkie 's flashlights etc however these newer nimh are just great no memory shelf and longer current life nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a	14
1	these batteries work well they do n't last as long as normal batteries but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs if you have kids with toys these are a must	14
1	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips	14
1	i was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that it also dried completly by the next time i needed to use it i would recommend it to anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster it is not soft and cozy but it does the job	14
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle she adores the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly not to mention that i a hearty creature in my prime love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors	14
1	just as it advertised it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly i bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out well i am sold on this product only drawback now is the high price tag	14
1	i love this item i received it as a gift and now use it every single day my hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this that 's great b c now i do not have to blow dry as much so my hair seems to be getting a lot healthier only complaint would be that it does not stay wrapped very well not sure if it 's the material or the size but nonetheless it still works great	14
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track i was figuring on getting an arm unit but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work the whole system is very easy to use and fast you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy i can say this was a great gift something i use a lot and something that will help me stay healthy	14
1	i purchased this for use in my bathtub it is more comfortable than the blow up ones and stays cleaner	14
1	i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far even though this is my first electric shaver it is a good deal for the money it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close i would recommend it or give it as a gift	14
1	my husband is in love with this razor ! he thought he was a norelco only fan until i bought him this model for christmas i purchased it due to the great reviews it received both from consumers and independent reviewers and also b c it cost less than 40 it leaves his face so smooth whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days in fact he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn highly recommended	14
1	my wife and i both love this in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable head trip than the trippers one might find in the mall the vibrations make it better than the non vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations it 's a pretty simple device sold at a reasonable cost and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones	14
1	also bought as a gift but i tried it ! very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in the mall	14
1	a very gentle undereye cream i have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time this one is definitely a keeper	14
1	it is a great product and makes my husband 's face as smooth as a baby 's you know	14
1	tastes better than most candy bars and has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients	14
1	very good very satisfying interesting blend of flavors dried fruit cocoa chili nothing dominates all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat i could n't eat one every day but for an occasional meal replacement it is very good too high calorie to be a snack item but it 's tempting	14
1	i am very pleased with the light output i purchased them to light the inside of my childs playhouse they really iluminate the inside as bright as a standard light bulb i purchased a couple of years ago an earlier type lanturn by rayovac and was really pleased with it also	14
1	i 've tried all kinds of bibs but nothing works better than pampers bibsters right size great pocket to catch crumbs covers my 18 mth old soaks up spills i use them full time not just on the road	14
1	i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years and i wo n't let any other soap touch my face ! i found it when i was searching for a soap that would n't make my skin itch all over after a shower i can tell you that after years and years my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf ! the soap is mild with a neutral scent which is a big plus it cleans great but does n't leave my skin dried out the 8 ounce bars are a bit large but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that 's easier for us smaller hands people	14
1	i recieved my product in a reasonable amount of time and i am happy with the product	14
1	i got what i expected it 's functional and not too poorly made the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great the rolling wheels still have no function for me but they do n't get in the way	14
1	i ordered this as a gift and it arrived in less than a week with their standard shipping ! the produict was exactly as described shalimar is a classic	14
1	as expected the new 7180xl razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave even though it runs much slower than earlier models the slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy just 2 noticable disappointments 1 the external power supply is a rather combersome change from former norelco products 2 the exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome feature of an otherwise good product at a premium price	14
1	very light electric razor cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes so a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week when running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade does a great job very quickly and smoothly you do n't need anything more	14
1	i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using he has been enjoying the features offered by this device he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints it was a great price for a quality product	14
1	i luv this burberry pple always comment anytime i wear it my girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it cos she said anytime i wear it she feels like doing things i ca n't mention here 2 me and since she feels tht way other women will certainly feel like tht i'm getting another one ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! also fast and proper services by amazon	14
1	clean and crisp defined and smooth i use burberry by burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening it has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn i am very picky about my fragrances and i only use two regularly eau d'issey by issey miyake is my main scent but i do use burberry sometimes on occassion and i love it thats it	14
1	this toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets i am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers i do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it rapid dissolve and will in time try an environmentaly friendly brand a great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage and ignore the presence of a plunger	14
1	if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper then this is the brand and variant you should switch to if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises \( rapidly dissolves \) i 'd have to give it five stars it practically melts as soon as it touches water do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue i'm giving it only four stars because it 's not my favorite toilet paper \( that would be charmin ultra \) but the necessary choice	14
1	i use this product all the time it was becoming hard to find in department stores but i found it available and cheaper online i'm very happy	14
1	i love this product and the lasting results it is so gentle on my hair i bought two one being a christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm and she agreed makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair if you are sleeping in curlers sleep no more this product is for you	14
1	i always have purchased caruso steam rollers but when i purchased their new ionic roller set it lasted i week and it was almost 3 times the money of the vidal sassoon this is the best !	14
1	first off ignore renee 's rating this woman has issues ! ! ! ! ! ! this toothbrush works great ! would highly recommend	14
1	i love this toothbrush its easy and it really imporoves your gum health	14
1	yes i did feel a difference benadryl is not effective for me so i was sceptical i am glad i found this i use for when i need to sleep in an unfamiliar place	14
1	this is a really good supplement to help you regulate your sleep pattern people please grow up and stop using this amazon review site to post useless nonsense go blog somewhere else	14
1	this was a gift it came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at so we were happy	14
1	i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body after drinking monster all day my body felt like a mess \( from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body \) there are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls	14
1	having tried most all energy drinks i can honestly say this one is different guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped one at noon and i'm good to go for the rest of the day plus i do n't go home and kick the dog ! the taste is not sugary and at about 1 40 a can \( free shipping \) the price speaks for itself	14
1	bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there no hair on him or pillows or sheets this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair i also used it on the tougher part of his beard wonderful item	14
1	it does a great job i just tought it wound n't let any hair go but i gess that 's impossible	14
1	the product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container	14
1	i have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette it has a light almost woodsy smell reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something classy yet sporting	14
1	i bought this product because i had one from years ago that i use when i go to the gym but lost it 's great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel is n't wet i am conflicted though i bought this one when i lost the one i already had it 's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original but i still like it for what it does i also like the little bag that it comes in which i did n't have with the original one	14
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers i learned about the revlon tourmaline all of the reviews were so positive i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are the placement could n't be better on the controls the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive a very good value	14
1	fast gentle light hair dryer no frizz quick drying results the diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air the dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job the motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use do n't waste your money on the expensive ones	14
1	very convenient reading glasses you could hang them on your neck when not using them and not even notice they are there they are very sturdy and are flexible making them almost imposible to break cons both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair as the glasses would trap your hair against your face	14
1	i use these glasses all the time at work they sure are handy glad i bought them	14
1	i have owned many beard trimmers but this is by far the best	14
1	i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best strong motor easy adjust strong vacuum other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard the idea is to glide the unit over your beard you 're not raking you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use the waste receptacle snaps out easily as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	14
1	these are the best nursing pads out there i tried several others that would not stick and would leak i 've never had any problems with these	14
1	this was the first brand of nursing pads i tried my first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy yet after trying several brands of nursing pads i came back to lansinoh they are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after i had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable the best deal i have found has been amazon 's price for 3 boxes	14
1	this is such a great product for nursing moms it is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from happening for a mom this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt	14
1	i have tried the gerber nursing pads and one other brand these nursing pads are the best i have a large supply of milk but i have not leaked through these pads they are also very soft and they are not visible through your clothing	14
1	it is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer it does its job pretty nicely the dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world a little big for travelling but compromises with its folding handle and light weight the disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage it is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment	14
1	it 's small folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer i just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot very convenient item if you travel	14
1	great help in dental hygene gets in hard to reach spots also a lot easier than flossin	14
1	these little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums flossing with traditional floss hurt because i always cut myself and deeply it probably saved me from serious gum disease and that i understand is expensive to treat so i 'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy	14
1	it is really great ! ! ! sure it does hurt but not any more than waxing i do not shave because i get cut very easily this is a great alternative to expensive waxing even when i have more hair it works i would buy this product again and again	14
1	i 've tried several lumbar cushions from amazon and this one is the most comfortable despite being so inexpensive i only wish it did n't have the wings on the side	14
1	i have been looking for a overbed table so that i could use my laptop and watch tv in the bed room and this is the one i have been looking for it takes about 15 mins for me to put it all together did not have any problem at all	14
1	safari by ralph lauren for women is the only eau de parfum my niece uses after she discovered safari she gave away her collection of purfumes i usually try to find safari for her birthday every year	14
1	this is a good little product did not expect much but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep thank	14
1	i bought this after using the inexpensive wahls for years i love it for several reasons 1 \) it cuts without pulling on your whiskers2 \) it is very precise3 \) it picks up 90 or more of your whiskers4 \) not only do you not have the hair in the sink but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard if there is any to speak of5 \) unlike others i did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache it worked just fin	14
1	bought this razor and happy with it so far it shaves close and is not as loud as i expected glad i bought this one	14
1	like the razor i have problems with ingrown hairs on my neck and this shaver has helped to alleviate the problem the nivea lotion is very soothing i have had to live with the fact that the shave on my neck is not the closest in the world but c'eat la vie i have taken to running a couple of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to apply the lotion as i continue if you start with the lotion you wo n't get a close shave i do wonder if one could n't simply buy a shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect	14
1	i never thought the world would get here i am actually spending time to type up a review online for shaving lotion well here you go for every man out there who is interested and who has ever used an electric shaver if you have n't tried the norelco cool skin electric shaver with this lotion you have to whoever has sensitive skin you need to switch to this because it does a great job that 's all i have to say and i wo n't waste anymore time	14
1	forget the liquids and throw away lens tissues this cloth works exceptionally well on my camera lenses i highly recommend it and am buying a couple more for my car glove compartment for sunglasses and my computer screen	14
1	a lot of work when into making this cloth excellent for cleaning lenses of all kinds glasses video and digital cameras etc if you care about your lenses health this is the cloth to buy congrats 3m	14
1	this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer you can do a real professional job with these two items robert paul jone	14
1	after total knee replacement this wedge sure helped to keep my knee in one place and elevated while preventing me from moving too much while i slept or was resting highly recommended	14
1	just received it and used it and can only say it is the greatest shaver ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the closest shave no razor burn fastest shave yet and very quite thank you norelco for this great saver j	14
1	i 've been using 2 of these batteries in my walkman for 10 hours now and they are still going very strong it 's living up to its reputation as described so far	14
1	heats up quickly tends to dry out more than previous chi flat iron i had much more economical	14
1	this is the best ! ! ! drys you off fast and drys fast too so soft and comfy on my skin ! !	14
1	there are several listings for this item in different versions before making a decision check out the other versions you will see many different reviews overall it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended it works ! you can see my full review under zeno pro pink	14
1	this product works great they recharge fast are just warm to the touch not hot and have extremely long battery life battery charger works great and has nice car charger adapter	14
1	these never leak and are good enough to wear over night this is the only diaper i buy	14
1	this works best for me i do n't like a wet or greasy look this holds well then dries as if nothing is on the hair without it my hair falls down into my eyes i think it 's the best	14
1	i bought the remington mb 300 mustache and beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky he has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed the remington has several adjustments for length that pleases him the most it trims whatever he aims it at and does it well it is light weight and maneuvers easily	14
1	overall an excellent trimmer this is what i have been needing all of these years finally a piece of equipment that does it all i have been very pleased with this trimmer it is solid and cuts without problem i love the adjustments and the removeable head thanks remington and my wife for the christmas present	14
1	i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it well made with good trim length settings it 's also easy to hold recommended	14
1	i have had a couple sets of these and love them this set is for a gift i am so anxious to give it to her	14
1	item was received in perfect shape it is a wonderful item and a great buy	14
1	now i finally have the look and feel of a celebrity the best product on earth period ! i 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me ive' spent thousand of dollars nothing comes close to it forget about it saliylic acid is history in my book sorry dermatologist their is a cure i bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 since the new year 2007 started i 've already bought 2 bottle 's and i'm spreading the word do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face j diaz aka \( papi rico	14
1	my son loves this it 's great for a night light he can even fill it up himself i recommend it for a childrens room	14
1	this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eye sore even in small rooms also stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours which i guess it 's good that it 's easy to refil the price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price perhaps you pay for the convient size overall i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size	14
1	as soon as i got this item i tried it out right away i will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that 's a minor point the real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do take down mosquitos and flys sure enough i killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes i also took down a housefly without any sweat this is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where i'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects no more an issue	14
1	having previously owned battery powered travel razors i was always disappointed with their power and battery life after all what 's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced \? the braun 370 bk was a pleasant surprise however powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing i also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost a great piece of tech at a good price	14
1	i bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower tub combo he loves it esp the height adjustment feature	14
1	it is working well little slow warm up but actually i wanted a hot air brush not this because i have very short hair but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush	14
1	does everything as advertized love the turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one minute	14
1	this would be a great item except it is n't clear that it only works on handles that are pointing to the right our doors have the handles going to the left leaving this item useless for us	14
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past shoulder length hair it works great ! i gotta admit it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the extra large size towel \( which is n't really all that large	14
1	this is a great fiber supplement ! ! when you chew it it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet tart i usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you do n't need water they have a good flavor and yes i do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas \) so do n't be in a small elevator	14
1	they are a nice compact size for travel they work as advertised just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated quick curl time	14
1	i have never used a roller after reading the reveiws i decided to purchase two set of rollers i have long hair it works really great on my hair looking at my hair everyone says it looks beautiful	14
1	i purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully i also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office gym and around the world they are easy to pack and are lightweight	14
1	great compact design takes up very little room in your suitcase rollers heat up are ready to use in about 2 3 minutes like the product claims sets hair better then most rollers \( and i have tried many \) the only thing that i would change is to add 2 4 more rollers but i liked these rollers so much i actually bought a 2nd set use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !	14
1	i got this product when the price dropped down to 12 so for that price i liked this product a lot it heats the lotion well initially i thought it was small but now i think it is the correct size i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back the lotion is ready and warm it is a great buy and for all you bargain shoppers wait till the price drops it is especially a great buy during winter	14
1	i ordered one of these for my girlfriend and she loves it friends and family have tried it and are thrilled this product will make holiday shopping easy for several women on my list	14
1	this is the best invention yet i could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt what a difference from cold cream to warm cream the cream itself was smoother and yes buttery ! i love this this is my best investment yet	14
1	such a thoughtful gift a real treat for those of us living in colder climates especially in the winter the warm lotion is truly a treat to dry itchy winter skin anyone would love this !	14
1	dr scholl 's foot cream was excellent it 's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell my feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and i noticed a difference immediately in my dry cracked heels i also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before i went to bed especially my hands were really soft in the morning i 've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed but i think the difference is that dr scholl 's has no alcohol in it and it 's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin	14
1	for me a good tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer i had the same one this brand for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment i immediately ordered my new tweezer if not dropped i suspect this would last a lifetime	14
1	i agree with the previous reviewer i have used this brush for years ! it was recommended to me by a hairdresser and i will never use a different brush unless you have fine thin hair you will love this brush ! ! !	14
1	this writting instrument is superb in it 's ability to compensate the energetic writer	14
1	i have always dated men who wear this cologne not on purpose but i always seem to find or smell men who wear this scent my mother calls it sex in a bottle the scent is light and pleasant but still smells like a man should smell	14
1	if you have trouble sleeping this mask is for you ! ! for anyone struggling to get even a few minutes worth of sleep you will not be disappointed ! ! fabulous ! whether for a nap or for getting through the night this mask will definitely help ! i have given several as gifts and everyone is in agreement with me ! the only negative is the company changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of sound therefore i wake up and have to re hit the sound selection but i'm still getting more sleep than i have in years and years !	14
1	these are a helpful item for me the cloth pockets are nice and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple	14
1	i looked a many other back support pads some were too big and others were just complicated the obus forme side to side is perfect it is very light weight and small therefore very portable i use it in the car and take it with me to the office the strap on the back fits well around any chair back although i have found i do n't need to use it because it stays put	14
1	this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot watch your ears and fingertips	14
1	there 's nothing like grabbing a warm totally sanitized toothbrush i have used this for years after i saw the inventor on 20 20 i had to try it out it works great ! its like using a new toothbrush everyday well worth it	14
1	i bought this for my mom for christmas i have the same one i take mine on every trip i go on she always says she needs one my whole life i have been a light sleeper and now i sleep through almost everything \( sometimes even my alarm \)	14
1	this nature made product is excellent however readers should be aware that this products does not contain iron for a very good reason taking iron supplements sets you up for potential health problems if you are a woman over 50 i hope the other reviewer takes note of this	14
1	its a freakin wet nap what else can i say \? not much to critique here i live in a small town their kind of hard to find so amazon to the rescue pros 1 style \( square \) 2 looks it does n't shout hey i'm a wet nap 3 shape it stays put in my truck does n't roll around 4 does a great job of what its intended to do nothiing more cons 1 non	14
1	while a little dubious i am know a believer really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts start with a single scoop and adjust as needed	14
1	this is a pretty good flavor it is n't my all time favorite \( apricot \) but way up there	14
1	clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture	14
1	the best sports bar around great taste organic contains plenty of antioxidants and contains a good amount of protein the only down side is the high amount of carbs especially the sugars but i still give it five stars	14
1	clif bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level definitely recommend having water available	14
1	i 've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty clif bars get it right	14
1	after buying several different seat cushions for my office chair i found this seat and it is the best choice i ever made the seat has a low profile but is extremely comfortable	14
1	i absolutely love this stuff i would recommend this to any person that has frizz it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe i started using it about 2 months ago and cannot stand to go without it just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and do n't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason i tried the chi silk infusion because i thought they would be the same since they are both made by farouk but the chi is not nearly as good i would give this 100 stars i could	14
1	have had several norelco razors over the years this is the closest shave i have ever gotten from any electric razor and it is also the quietest only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave highly recommend	14
1	upgraded from an old norelco to this and just love it shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip the only con i see is the 8 hour charge time which has been the norm for norelcos in this class for a long time if you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price this is a great choice	14
1	the refills were easy to order fit my brush perfectly it 's a lot easier ordering on line received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store	14
1	product arrived as expected i 've had the tooth brush for about a year now and i love it one complain i have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty it cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach i have not tried soaking it in oxyclean that might work even better	14
1	this an excellent tool to self massage yourself it is very steady and very controllable you can really reach in with it i tried different canes and this is the best one buy it for yourself and your friends and they will love it ! do n't forget to buy the instructional dvd it is really helpful in learning the proper way to use it	14
1	i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b c washable ones were sufficient with my second child i did both and i found these to be the best b c washable ones are not enough they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched they are very thin and discreet other pads are not as big so not enough overage i never bother with the adhesives b c they do n't work they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk i just wished they were softer and less paper like	14
1	this is the best dispenser we have used it attches to the wall easily is eay to fill and is constructed in such a way that it has multiple uses we purchased smaller ones to give as gifts knowing others would like it also	14
1	i bought one of these 'gizmos' as a gift 3 years ago and i was so happy to find it on here ! ! it is like going to a salon and getting the best shampoo ever !	14
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it it gets very hot warm very fast and is very comforting i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches i would recommend this product to anyone i'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift	14
1	i think that they are great diapers i have used other diapers in the past and i am now sitcking with luvs ! ! ! ! i get more for my money and they work great	14
1	i purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers we are all on our feet all day long after one other coworker told us about the one he had we all had to have one to help our tired feet everyone of us is very happy with this product it is a great value for the price there are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super we did have a problem with one but amazon quickly exchanged it for us i think it was defective from the factory great product and even better service from amazon	14
1	this hair dryer is truly a professional salon type dryer many dryers are advertised as such but this one lives up to that reputation very sleek beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature this was a surprise \( turbo \) which i'm enjoying coupled with the smooth and strong drying the sound is even pleasant not too loud and it works quickly \( especially since i have very thick hair \) i would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price aj in n	14
1	we keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed it takes a 30 minute cycle and you just put things in and walk away it has n't damaged anything vs sanitizing in the washing machine and i do n't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers we 've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes etc to periodically clean them i think it 's great	14
1	i really like this sanitizer the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish that it was bigger so i could fit bottles and things slightly larger in it but i do put her pacifiers and bottle nipples in there	14
1	the shaver was very good it gives a very close shave not only do i shave my face but i also shave my head it feels like i use a normal shaver after i am done my nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave it seems to give a better shave this wa	14
1	works great and with any mattress due to severe neck injuries i can now sleep better at a slight incline thanks	14
1	he 'd always had problems with frequent canker sores after he tried this \( on a recommendation from his dentist \) his canker sores went from 2 3 week to 2 3 year !	14
1	these wipes are strong have just the right amount of moisture and do n't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave my son had diaper rashes as a newborn when we were at home we could wash rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering but when we were out and had to use wipes his rash would flare up after switching to these wipes and 7th gen diapers the rash went away later on i tried pampers again and the rash came back using seventh gen really has kept his skin rash free my older son also has a lot of itching when we use pampers much less with these wipes diapers	14
1	this razor is the best i have ever shaved with it copes with every length of hair and angle of growth whether i shave every day every other day or even every third day perfect	14
1	well the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great compared to other battery operated shavers i agree my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys	14
1	bought the massager overall ok but it is heavy to use with one hand after sometime it gets to you it has a good vibration capability better than the others i had could have a better handle and a longer cord how about making them 110 240v then i can travel with it	14
1	has all of the features that i wanted digital readout body fat monitor relatively easy to set up	14
1	this is easy to use and set up it even has a 3rd space for a guest you do n't have to get your body fat and water each time i like it	14
1	accurate scale records use of two different users plus guests \( or your chlidren ! \) remembers prior info body fat is a great and fairly accurate feature these combined features make it worth the cost plan on reading the manual to set up	14
1	i have had 2 other sonicare toothbrushes and love them ! i shopped around and due to amazon 's fabulous return policy and excellent customer service there was no question where i would purchase their price was very competitive and their excellent customer service made it easy to feel good about buying here	14
1	although the compartments seem small you can fit lots of food into this bowl it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections so you can separate your veggies meat etc the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break \( so i use it to store food in the fridge i have all of the other fit fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken	14
1	i think it nice for me make my eyes relax after long time working before computer	14
1	its a very nice little fountain the lighting on the ceiling is really cool and the water noises are adjustable depending on how you arrange the rocks it does n't have near enough rocks so i'm going to go and get some but i think once i fill it up a little more it 'll look a lot better too i'm satisfied i actually bought another one	14
1	i purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself the person for whom i purchased them is very happy with them and so am i i was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because i have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour it is too soon to tell but i hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands	14
1	works like a charm it is absolutely worth the price i would buy another in a heartbeat	14
1	i used this while breastfeeding my son and while i only had one issue of chapping it was a lifesaver i loved it then and have used it on several other things since great on chapped hands lips etc but i do n't know what i would have done without this wonder creme and it 's an essential baby gift that i tend to give at showers !	14
1	if you own one of these shavers then you need to replace with these every year buy the best buy these and shaver will stay like new	14
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb i tried contacting the company with this new one u cannot get an answer the company seems to have a non working number other than that the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it	14
1	i 've been using this scrub for a while it greatly improved the quality of the shave that i get i get a lot less irritation i 've also used a similar product from lancome \( more expensive \) and actually prefer nivea better	14
1	this is a great heating pad if you like heat it ranges from low to hi with 4 settings in between \( that is 6 settings \) especially nice is the loooooong cord my old heating pad has like a 6 ft cord and i always needed an extension cord for it good purchase !	14
1	i have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it the auto shut off is annoying when i forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise very pleased just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it does n't rattle like the old fashioned ones great improvment and larger size	14
1	it works so great i broke my left wrist and was in a cast for nine weeks i will be using the stand after i can use my left wrist it is very sturdy and adjust to different hights	14
1	smells divine ! this is a powder sweet and refreshing scent that wo n't overwhelm the senses it 's soft and subtle yet killer if it complements your body chemistry i love using this particular fragrance \( especially during special occasions \) it exudes both simplicity and sophistication wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy ! ! ! try it	14
1	this razor is fantastic the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream gel would but if you are looking for a quick handy and yet still good shave this is exactly what you are looking for	14
1	i had never used an auto cuff before so i had my doubts but after using this over a period of weeks it seems to be right on the money every time i would buy it agai	14
1	i have used this blood pressure monitor almost every day for weeks and it works great it 's an excellent value and i would recommend it to my friends without reservation	14
1	i have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries \( 6 two packs \) and i must say that they work exactly how i projected them to they hold a charge well enough for my uses in various electronics and my infant 's papasan swing regular duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days these batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and i have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss i am very pleased so far with my purchase get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size d become easily available and cheaper	14
1	i did n't have any trouble with them being too large i tested them in a battery operated light string against a no name non rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time	14
1	excellent product easy to mount and the clarity of the mirror is great	14
1	the mirror is great i use it for shaving my face and it fits the bill perfectly both the normal and 5x mirrors are nice and clear	14
1	the jerdon 7p7506cf \( or as i call it the ol'6cf \) is a nice reflective wall attachable mirror i ca n't say enough about how reflective this thing is i'm a bit of an amateur facepainter \( although i have zero artistic ability my spider man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes \) so i need a good mirror whenever i self paint i have gone through three similar models before finding the 6cf and none has been as clear and user friendly in short if you 're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar i ca n't recommend this thing enough it 's the mirror of the 21st century and beyond	14
1	this is a good medium priced shaver it does a good job is fast and easy to clean it is attractive and fits the hand well not top of the line but a good value nothing negative to report	14
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too a v close shave in about 2 minutes i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness i dont use the cleaning station i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased	14
1	now my husband ca n't borrow my gasses and i never loose them i have one of each color and get rave comments every time i take them off in front of strangers	14
1	i like the shampoo it is nice but i do not like the plastic bottle because you cannot remove the cap	14
1	i bought it for my daughter 's birthday she says it hurts at first but really gets the kinks out she is very pleased with it	14
1	convenient to use good battery life good shave for an electric shaver but still not as good as a blade also a little hard to use at edges such as sideburns under and around nose	14
1	i have loved dolce gabanna light blue since it came out i was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon and am certainly a satisfied customer ! the shipping was so fast i was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks and it was delivered ahead of schedle ! thanks so much	14
1	great price free shipping basically i love it ! ! i placed my order on sunday and got it 8 00 a m tuesday morning i highly recommend this seller i will definitely continue to buy from this seller myself	14
1	i loved it and guys really love it the smell is so fresh and clean	14
1	this is the best shaver i have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving	14
1	i bought this for my wife when her sonicare died she loves it great price she did n't want the better one and is very happy with it her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing	14
1	initially the sensation made me giggle after a couple uses i got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly my teeth feel cleaner mouth fresher and i'm hopeful that i will no longer get the floss lecture from my dental team now that 's something to smile about !	14
1	have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53 we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all works as advertised and worth every penny	14
1	i have been using this line of products since they were marketed my plastic surgeon \( not used for facial needs \) keeeps remarking on my skin and has to remind himself that i am 61 !	14
1	my last braun razor was model 6550 which i purchased 7 years ago the braun 8975 is a pleasure using quick and close shave the technology has come a long way i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet	14
1	i was skeptical of this product especially at the price however i am so pleased with its effectiveness i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years and i'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red angry looking spot this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager	14
1	these glasses are a great idea however they do not work with long hair the back strap of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose \( so you can see over them for distance \) long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair	14
1	good product the pressure could be a little stronger with the sponge head it has a nice scent and when the crystals had leaked upon arrival i had excellent customer service from the company to replace it	14
1	this was my heating pad but my hairless cat took it over he has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one the first day i could n't pry him off i love that it 's washable in fact i'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash of course i keep it pretty low for him being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that 's not enough	14
1	this heating pad wraps around stays put does a perfect job and turns off by itself spend the money and get a better mousetrap	14
1	pink sugar is a wonderful scent i have received many compliments on this fragrance its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey it is however a sweet scent everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it at this price 32 14 for 3 4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that i say buy it you cannot go wrong	14
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent it is one of my favorites it smells exactly like cotton candy its fun flirty and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents then this one is for you	14
1	i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair \( and have it stay straight \) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners and this one is by far the best i have long curly hair and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes much better than the hour i'm used to plus the straightening lasts my hair stays completely flat all day instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener you simply ca n't get better than this !	14
1	i bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser \( well the pink one was my idea \) and this is by far the best product i 've ever used i even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great and it 's usually a nappy tangled mess after i work out there really is nothing better than the chi for straight silky hair i 've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it it 's worth the price	14
1	first this is a big and cumbersome but second this is the best foot spa got it for the wife and had to try it myself i am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and i had to ease into the heat it stayed hot the entire time the jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless \( just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you do n't have to move an inch \) \) the rollers on the bottom are nice too it gets loud when on high jets mode but nothing to grand fast shipper would recommend	14
1	the dispenser looks good holds a decent volume of shampoo conditioner etc it is simple to refill the bottles and so far there is no leakage the mounting was easy glued onto the tiles with silicone glue \( included \) if it broke or we decided to replace it we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles the top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads overall satisfied good product for the price	14
1	this was sent to my daughter and son in law as a thank you present for a recent visit i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap shampoo etc my son in law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well	14
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids kids will be kids but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push easy to mount and easy to use	14
1	it is very easy to use turns on very quickly and seems to be quite accurate i also love that there are no extras required \( e g ear tip covers \) the kids want to have their temperature taken	14
1	i own this unit for more than a year bought it in the local drug store for 20 first unit was bad displaying low battary error i exchanged it same day for another one i compared readings with traditional thermometers and found it to be very accurate fast and can show in both c and f the best i 've ever had the case is bad lock broke in a week	14
1	this mabis steam inhaler really puts out the steam ! i am very satisfied and would heartily reccommend this item to anyone looking for a steam inhaler	14
1	great price good product escellent service i will buy from this supplier again	14
1	just love the homedic foot bath easy to use and very ssothingon the feet the pedicure attachments are a plus the price was just great !	14
1	this is really fun to do with a friend its so spa like i love it ! but it has so many warnings im afraid to do something wrong	14
1	this is a great sized foot bath i pour hot water in it sit back and relax it does n't keep the water warm but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i'm ready to get out using the pedicure attachements is hard work though i just assume use a hand held brush the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv still for the price i like this foot bath i 've even given it as a gift	14
1	i bought this for my boyfriend i needed something affordable and this was it the bubble machine is quiet and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time the only complaint i have are the warnings it has it just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if i make a mistake well other than that this product is good i 've had it for i think a couple of months now and nothing awful has happened and it 's still working fine	14
1	this product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy \( be careful not to use too much ! \) it works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer ! not surprisingly when i use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair \) i wish it would combat frizz a little more but my hair is less frizzy when i use it i guess the next thing i 'll try is the bumble and bumble frizz fighter	14
1	i love this book light ! it has survived countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old it works great with hardback and paperback books this is by far the best book light i have ever used	14
1	imagine your eyes closed and tiny vibrating fingers massaging your head and neck until you try this product you ca n't truly imagine how good it feels everyone deserves a little joy in their day right \?	14
1	this product is totally awesome it works great no problems at all since i have mostly carpteting in my apartment i have to move it to a hard surface every time i want to use it it zeros perfectly every time and gives me an accurate reading when compared to the doctors scale	14
1	i was requested to write a review by amazon i felt this request was premature since i used this product only for a month so far i am quite satisfied with the user friendlyness price and ability to use and clean the shaver in wet environment	14
1	i love this razor it gives a nice close shave is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry nothing to complain about here	14
1	i received one of these towels as a gift several years ago it was by far one of the best gifts i have ever received ! it soaks all of the water out of your hair and leaves it perfect for blow drying for women this is a five star gift	14
1	this is by far my favorite out of all the odwalla bars i used to purchase it at trader joe 's but they no longer carry this flavor so i was especially delighted when i saw it on amazon	14
1	i 've only used the kit once and it did what it was supposed to no problems everything went fine and i intend to use it again within about a month it should pay for itself very quickly	14
1	i have medium colored hair and i 've used this trimmer many times it shaves away the hair just fine for me you know need to know how to get to all the hair if your hair is so coarse that this trimmer does n't work you i 'd recommend waxing ! fast effective good angling	14
1	i have received so many compliments on this fragrance i can always pick out the scent when someone else is wearing it although a fragrance will smell different on each person i have not known of anyone this one did not work for i guess the negative reviewer is the first i have heard of i highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh fragrance	14
1	great tasting bar nice and soft make it easy to eat	14
1	i love these bars i 've tried all the flavors and they 're all pretty darned great i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they are n't as filling as i 'd like but they 're great for a snack or sugar craving	14
1	these were a great deal and they are the only diapers other than cruisers that my son does n't leak through	14
1	this is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs also check out elaine petrone 's miracle balls which you can also use in the car and for other things the support is sturdy and has a mesh back which helps to keep you cool and comfortable a great deal for the cost	14
1	compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect oh well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect but considering others' reviews i am pretty confident that i am gonna love it longer than at the first sight the only thing is i do n't know where to put it the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time	14
1	i have two penguin humidifiers which i purchased a couple of months ago for the money i think these are great and simple to use i did not have any problems with leakage the key is to make sure that the top is on securely also some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base just carry a washcloth with you no problem super quiet i think it is just the right size for a bedroom easy to clean and fill i had tried others \( honeywell and vicks \) and this is by far my favorite	14
1	we all have very pale skin in my family and these are great little i forgot to put on sunscreen helpers ! i keep one in the car one in my purse etc so we are never without one excellent product and easy to use	14
1	this is the best shaver i have ever owned and i wish it was still available	14
1	this is 100 percent plastic makes me nervous dealing with it the variable sprays are nice one is so wide it shoots outside the shower make sure you crank on this when fixing it to the water pipe i really had to tighten it to keep it from leaking one other reader snapped hers on the install i was afraid the same would happen it is a good shower head not great	14
1	this is the last hair straightener you will every buy heats up quickly and straightens long thick and even curly hair in minutes have n't stopped receiving compliments since i started using it	14
1	i love this product i have thick hair and the ceramic plates are very wide wich allow you to staighten your hair quickly does an awesome job	14
1	i am having the same problem i ordered this product from amazon on august 26 it is now october 26 i have not recieved it yet i have never had this problem with amazon before i may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else it is a shame because amazon does have the best price i have found so far i gave it 5 stars only because i had to give it a rating i wanted to be fair to the company but i have honestly never used one	14
1	this item is great it holds shampoo and conditioner or whatever liquids you need in the shower and also has a handy basket that i use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream the handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place however i had to buy this item from another vendor because amazon kept delaying shipment after the delays had exceeded a month i finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere good product bad transaction	14
1	the monitor is relatively cheap easy to use and mostly accurate the one gripe i have is that if i take my pulse 3 times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to 40 points ! usually this is not a problem i tend to check it 3 times and average the 3 which is sufficient for my purposes	14
1	i had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until i went to a friend 's house and saw what i was missing i put that scale on my wish list that day this is a lightweight fairly compact scale with on off tare and grams ozs buttons it has a clear plastic removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs and down to 1 4 oz i like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up	14
1	this is the best reacher i have ever used i am in a wheelchair due to ms and have used various types over the past 6 years but the quality and ease of use is much better with this	14
1	by far the best hair straightener i have purchased i have spent so much time money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results i can now say that i have found it i bought the 2 turbo and it gets the job done on my course naturally curly hair one of my all time favorite purchases i never travel without it	14
1	i needed something to help me maintain my short hair inbetween barber shop appointments and this is a good thing to buy my fiancee helps me keep the maitenence between my appointments	14
1	never owned one of these electric jobs before could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked hated brushing my teeth before and now i will look forward to the experience never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean \? everyone should have one	14
1	i have had other bath pillows that slid around or just were not comfortable either itchy or not supportive at all this pillow is just right and nice and soft and has n't gotten exceptionally dirty or moldy which i was worried about	14
1	i already own a syncopro shaver so i decided to get one for my dad he had been asking about electric shavers for a couple of weeks prior to me purhasing one for him the reason i choose braun is because i love my shaver and have never had any problems just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you 'll be ib great shape i love the way it shaves nice and clean ! ! ! ! i trully recommend this product	14
1	i took my unit to a monthly meeting for seniors their machine broke i took mine as a replacement they liked it so well they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings they like all the different aspects of the machine a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine \?	14
1	10 bucks and does the job you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do	14
1	i 've only had this scale for a short time but so far so good i 've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money as someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often i specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason with an inexpensive digital scale which is what i had last you ca n't reset it like you can an analog this scale is a great buy for only 10 how can you go wrong !	14
1	this small flosses is great to get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it the little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth happened at least couple of times so i switch to the string floss	14
1	excellent price and quick shipping this was the best available for 3 4 oz size	14
1	i am in my early 30 's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break outs along my jaw line chin and cheeks for the past couple of years i have tried murad proactiv acnefree and many other systems without success a month ago i picked up the neutrogena system when i saw it on sale within five days days my skin started to clear now i have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break out since starting the system i have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before finally a product that works and comes at a decent price !	14
1	this dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time after initially filling the dispensers it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button it has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower ! it also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need	14
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids kids will be kids but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push easy to mount and easy to use	14
1	\( \) it takes some getting used to but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave i got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks but i think i was pressing too hard like i had to with my old razor just a light touch gives a close shave the attachable sideburn trimmer does n't do a very good job in my opinion but i kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose the gel packs go pretty quickly but maybe i'm using too much i'm still trying to get the hang of it it 's a different experience than your basic razor	14
1	i ordered this parfum because it is really cheap i received it 4 days after ordering delivered very fast the flavor is very nice make me feel comfortable	14
1	we received these cards as a christmas gift they are very well made the quality is outstanding some have beads on them and some have details that you cannot get on a card without spending a fortune for them well worth it to buy them you wo n't be disappointed !	14
1	these batteries are used non stop one set in and one on the charger no problems would buy again !	14
1	it 's useful not the prettiest but it makes reading more comfortable especially for those times when you do n't feel like sitting all proper at the table or desk	14
1	i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep	14
1	okay i have n't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years but i must say this one is exactly perfect and has everything i would ever want in a hair dryer it has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly leaving it soft and frizz free i highly recommend this product	14
1	the best price around for this type massager price was my main reason for the purchase mine does heat up but the massager does have to be running for a few minutes before you notice it the programmable feature is nice as well as the many variable speeds i would highly recommend it	14
1	just received this massager and my wife and i ca n't stop massaging each other with it especially great deal for the special amazon price i 've been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones \( that just fit in the palm of your hand \) glad i splurged only problem is that amazon site says 7 heads item description says 6 heads and actul product only included 5 heads the one missing from the picture on the box is the acu point heads i'm guessing that 's why it 's on sale \? still worth it if you get it on sale great massager	14
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years this works better than my last the low setting and the larger brush works better for me the high setting blows the hair off the bristles it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron	14
1	so far these fit the bill just used them for the first time find that they are easy to put on and comfortable and better yet do n't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain rope string	14
1	very convenient to use however since the neck band is rigid and does not fold it is difficult to carry	14
1	excellent product works well only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger	14
1	i love this straightener ! i have had two other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over 80 and this one works much better then either of the other two all my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it	14
1	i never thought that i could get my hair straight enough to actually like it until i found this vs sassoon straightener it is the best ! ! i use it all the time and i love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft i would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight soft hair to use this product you ca n't go wrong !	14
1	i used this product and ca n't say enough good things about it my friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and i lost 30 pounds in 6 months and i was never hungry i ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my dietmate i love it thank yo	14
1	clic eyewear is a thoroughly convenient way to wear reading glasses i keep them with me hung around my neck all the time the glasses are made well almost every person who sees me click them together wants to know where i got them	14
1	very convenient to use however since the neck band is rigid and does not fold it is difficult to carry	14
1	my husband bought three pairs of these glasses and they are the only pair that he has n't lost yet he absolutely loves them just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use i think they look funny but who cares they are convenient and a great product	14
1	the only sunglass reading glasses i could find plus because they can hang around the neck i do n't forget where they are	14
1	for the last 15 years i have been a manual razor user i decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the norelco 7745x to be just what i wanted i can say that i am glad i did it is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy	14
1	i bought this vaporizer several weeks ago i feel better after i use this it created steam very fast \( about 2 3 minutes after plugging \) you may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam however a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time \( about 12 20 hours \) you may not need to use salt	14
1	we only use seventh generation laundry products now it is amazing how much better our clothes feel with these products the baby detergent gets the babies very dirty clothes very clean in our front loader	14
1	a good product to be sure i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased this review is however a cautionary while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads it is only rated for 18 loads just a heads up ! note i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment thus this review	14
1	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow it is abrasive to the skin i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly other than that it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many	14
1	casein is a great long lasting protein perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey casein in general is bland \( think no fat no salt cottage cheese \) and harder to mix than whey optimum nutrition has here a decent casein that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein i 've tried the price is ok but i 'd like to see it cheaper \( who would n't \? \) i mix it with whey and use it throughout the day i have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor	14
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these mine arrived with one case broken open although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag	14
1	i have pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution they 're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you 're done i hate that i'm consuming a product that is so disposable but at the same time it works so well	14
1	adds a great fragrance to the room we bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house it 's a different smell in every room what a pleasant change from smelling the pets	14
1	this was almost too strong for me at first i put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that basement smell for months i was impressed with the throw this thing had i would definitely repurchase	14
1	i bought this item because i was going to europe for a month i did n't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time unless you buy more than one converter kit you do need a plug adaptor \( these are relatively inexpensive \) then you just switch the voltage plug it in and it works great i used it in switzerland france and italy when i came home to the states i just switched the voltage back and i now use it at home it is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase i would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad	14
1	this is a great little dryer if you travel or just for home use well worth the price cookiema	14
1	this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer i have paid alot more for more well known brand named dryers i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past buy this hair dryer you wo n't be sorry	14
1	i appreciate the gentle yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together	14
1	great tasting bar nice and soft make it easy to eat	14
1	i have been very satisfied with the monitor it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included a quick phone call had them on the way i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time etc all in all it is a quite satisfactory device	14
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks with nimh rechargable batteries installed and it performs as advertised there is in my opinion a design flaw the start stop button acts as the power on off function and is easily depressed at unwanted times e g putting into or removing from the case they could should have included an ac adapter	14
1	this parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come it has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it ! it is by far in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo ! i give this bold majesty of the monarchy the \( il duce \) ! five stars	14
1	i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip my roommate is a snorer and i figured i needed the sound i tried it out at home and liked it it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel it was a good buy for my purposes	14
1	i like the portability and adjustability of this mirror it takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly it serves my needs very well i was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit i tend to use the normal mirror more often the other is the clock loses it 's setting when i stow it away it has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature as far as i am concerned i was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock	14
1	my husband and i love this thermometer for our own use let alone the grandkids ! it 's fast easy and reliable highly recommend it	14
1	i tried the ear thermometers and never could get them to work our pediatrician used one of these rub across the forehead kind at her office during a checkup and said it was as accurate as the ear kind and much easier to use especially when kids have earaches \( grabbing an itty bitty earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen sore ear canal \? \? \? ouch \) with a minute 's practice \( after reading the instructions \) you get the hang of using it and never dread checking temperatures again	14
1	i have been using this razor for about 6 years now probably as long as they have been out they may be pricey but well worth it i used to use disposables and nicked cut my legs almost every time i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little it is so quick and easy to use and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams they do only last for 3 5 shaves but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream it 's probably not that much more expensive	14
1	recommend it suppressed my appetite the first day when i got hungry it took a few bytes to feel full again	14
1	this protein is unbelievable i have tried many different brands varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there it does n't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste it 's not too sweet mixes lump free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop once you try it this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry	14
1	it cost a little more but it 's worth it it keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare	14
1	as a tape measure it does what it says it does you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part you wo n't have to worry about did i hold the tape tigher last time \? as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time the tape starts measurement at 2 since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches i think this tape is accurate plus or minus half an inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level	14
1	at first i did n't quite get how great this shaving cream is because you have to work a little harder to get it to lather than the other shaving creams or gels i had been using but once it breaks into a lather it 's great plus it lasts at least 3 times longer than regular cans of shaving cream gel i'm buying this from now on	14
1	i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box the best part naturally is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages i feel refreshed everytime i used it it took awhile to get the drainage to stop but i am glad i purchased this system it works	14
1	product is exactly what you would expect i have been using it for 2 months 3 5 times a day with great success i would buy it again knowing how well it works	14
1	i'm not a sucker for advertising and i'm definitely not an impulse buyer but i did purchase a schick quattro razor some time ago to replace my old tired blade and i 've been satisfied thoroughly with it however after needing some refills i bought these titanium coated blades wow i did n't believe it at first but i actually took a new titanium blade and the regular schick blades and \( i ca n't believe i'm about to confess this \) did one of those hokey side by side tests this blade is excellent it is an upgrade above their standard blade and to me worth the difference in price	14
1	i 've owned this item for about a year and it works great comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and never had a problem with it deflating i recommend this item	14
1	after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed but it 's been over 2 months and so far so good i sleep on it every night \( i'm buying a real bed when i move in june \) and it is holding up	14
1	looking for something small and portable \? this is perfec	14
1	my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old ! !	14
1	this is exactly what i wanted the last 1 i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going i was afraid each day it would go out and could not find a replacement anywhere you are a life i mean hair saver ! ! diane in texa	14
1	i have 3 of the priva ultra waterproof sheet protectors and love the product ! it saves washing the whole bed just put a draw sheet over the protector and it saves so much laundry washes and dries extremely well	14
1	i bought two of these for my son hoping to wean him out of pull ups at night without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident this pad is definitely leakproof the only con is that even though it says it has an anti slip backing that is not the case i have tried it with jersey sheets and flannel sheets but it does move alot and get bunched up so i do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night if i had it to do over again i would definitely buy the pad with the tuck under flaps	14
1	alka seltzer got it right and in a big way drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment i prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus	14
1	b b styling creme is absolutely the greatest hair product i have ever used thanks for making it available on line	14
1	i bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband after the first night i knew i wanted one to put in our rv too my husband complained about the smell when i unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years he had me order one for his sister for christmas i thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now i have purchased four ! this is a wonderful product i would recommend it to anyone	14
1	i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling	14
1	i 've used the pigeon brand \( i believe it 's from japan \) milk storage bags those are the best quality bags i 've ever used unfortunately they 're also very difficult to find these lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1 3 of pigeon 's price not bad at all ! my baby and i travel a lot so i bring along my stock of bmilk in these lansinoh bags no mishaps thus far highly recommended	14
1	i love these bags they are easy to get out of the container easy to open and close and once the milk is in they stand on their own to be honest i have n't tried other brands so these may not be the only great ones	14
1	i 've used this product with two of my children with out problems i have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands suggestions write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels also never fill the bag ! it 's only meant to hold 6 oz these bags are much thicker than the gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper i used these liners with my avent disposable system and standard bottles i 've gone through over 600 of these bags and i must say amazon has the best price around	14
1	these bags are much sturdier and thicker than the gerber bags you also do n't have to cut the bags open after defrosting heating them up amazingly they are cheaper than the gerber bags too ! i 've used them for several months and have n't had one leak yet but i am pretty careful and store the milk bags flat in tupperware containers in the freezer	14
1	this is a great product i use it on my eyeglasses as well as my computer screen tv screen recommend it to al	14
1	i have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies i have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks ! ! my son still fits in the size diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it no leaks no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning !	14
1	i used the huggies overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training i used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull ups to get him through the night without leaks but even that did n't work very well finally huggies came out with an overnight pull up and it really works well ! ! ! excellent product	14
1	i have had this straightener for a while and i still have no complaints about it it is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener i love the heat settings i only need to put mine on the second setting \( 338 degrees \) for it to do a good job and i have very thick wavy curly hair i like the 1 because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair but i'm sure the 2 one is great too	14
1	i get this stuff for my husband he 's got really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny it 's worth the money	14
1	i used the remington twice up to now and the bottom line it is a great machine you will never need to lube it and that is a big deal with clippers its easy to clean sharp and easy to work with	14
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially but also in your neck and feet your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane	14
1	the knots in my back my spots never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was he explained the concept i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there i bought one the next day you do n't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots	14
1	this is the razor to use ! excellent product does what is says	14
1	lathers well with a pleasant \( subtle \) scent shipping costs spoil some of the fun you might consider barclaycrocker given its shipping and product costs	14
1	this is a fine well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom it reminds me of tangerine lifesavers if that helps it 's a big bar too the dimensions of the bar are in inches 4 x 2 5 and 1 5 thick	14
1	i 've had one of these little trimmers for four or five years now it does its jobs and i 've have no reliability problems at all one word of advice do n't use it on the boys without the little plastic guard or you 'll be sorry	14
1	when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out just enough to see your baby by but not enough to keep everyone awake it 's been almost a year now and i'm just about to purchase two more we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine we use it every night	14
1	these paper towels are as good as any cheaper paper towels they are not cloth like or super thick but they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the same price that are n't made of recycled materials in short they are cheap and better for the environment than non recycled chlorine bleached products	14
1	i have used this twice a day and love it best buy at this price	14
1	i got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great i know i should probably replace the head by now but it still seems to work fine so i do n't i 've only changed the battery once if you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type this is it then again if you 're not lazy or weak you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries	14
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago and have been very satistfied with it the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush the price is good the battery life is good and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !	14
1	my wife loves this ! it was not too expensive and she really has been very appreciative esp for her eye makeup	14
1	love it ! love it ! love it ! it 's like a high pressure car wash \( i do n't sound like a high pressure salesman \?	14
1	easy on the back and shoulders as this is very light it does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming my 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy ! i bought this in a drug and discount store for 13 95 it 's worth that	14
1	the razor and trimmer are both easy to use and give a nice clean shave i am very happy with this item	14
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas to my knowledge he has used it only once with no complaints was nice for the main reason he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it purchasing was a breeze thank yo	14
1	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads different sizes for many years and i'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating i would n't be without mine it helps me manage my arthritis fibromylagia nerve damage pain i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well	14
1	this is a wonderful product it smells great as well as works great i was worried that it would be too drying on my skin but it was n't it seemed to balance between where it was needed and where it was n't	14
1	as advertized as promised and at a savings ! \( better pricing c w walmart target and online	14
1	when i do n't eat as many veggies as i should these are easy to take	14

1	i do a lot of walking as well as standing on my feet all day for work receiving this product as a test drive was fabulous ! i never knew a cream could work so well at relieving my tired aching feet and restoring my skin i 'd definitely recommend this product	14
1	out of all the hair striaghters i have owned and i have gone through about 6 this is the best one yet ! i really like it ! it straightens my hair perfectly and you cant beat the price	14
1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids but i find it perfect for me it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber what more can you ask for	14
1	the filter is small compared with most other systems has a sturdy metal fixture and pull knob activator filters quickly with plenty pressure and of course it has the great culligan taste	14
1	excellent product really protects you my dermatologist recommended this product and although it 's more expensive it 's worth the protection for your skin i'm glad my children are using it	14
1	finally a product that does as it promises excellent sun burn protection even in hawaii	14
1	i am very satisfied with nizoral anti dandruff shampoo many anti dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough i have thick waist length hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage unlike some anti dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell nizoral has a pleasant fragrance i 'll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo	14
1	nizoral anti dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product i noticed a difference the first time i used it there was no residue on my scalp and my flakiness was greatly reduced it produced a very rich lather also the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen i myself am sensitive to many products and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo i would recommend this product to others	14
1	love it love it love it ! it got my hair soooooo straight and in record time i highly recommend this product esp for african american hairtypes	14
1	excellent productmy hair was striaght and dry in a matter of minutes	14
1	the foot massager is great it 's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like the massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit the massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt raise lower and etc the only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it so keeping it upright can be a bit challenging but for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet	14
1	this product is simply phenomenal i 've seen better results using this than with department store brands	14
1	i picked this up at the store a couple of months ago and it works well i does have a nice light scent initially and it sooths the face it does not have any spf though so in summer i used a different balm but it has been good this winter check it out	14
1	it usually takes forever for me to dry my hair but it dried really fast and straight ! i can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer ! and the color is beautiful i just love orange o	14
1	saw this product or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns australia it was selling for about 70 australia dollars which is still quite expensive converted to us i came back to u s and found it on amazon for 15 99 with free ship if i purchased 30 so i bought two one for myself one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks less the neckchains which always used to get tangled it 's an ingenius invention	14

1	the clippers are excellent quality and cut well we have a poodle that has very thick hair if you take your time these clippers do a wonderful job	14
1	i bought this model 7 years ago for over 100 and it is still running strong although i only use it to clip a small family dog nevertheless forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal this clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action in fact with the right \( replaceable \) blade you could use this to cut kids hair as well it stays cool unlike the magnetic motor design use with oster kool lube and you will never have problems getting a clean cut it uses blades by oster so there is a lot of versatility possible	14
1	man these things are the best they can handle whatever issues i throw at them i 've done considerable load testing as i'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops thanks for making my life easier i'm totally back into life with depends	14

1	i was looking for a lightweight simple wet dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies the panasonic wes9941p fit perfectly gives a nice shave and it 's so easy to clean it replaces my old braun single head linear \( i like the panasonic better \) the batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close	14
1	had one for the last 2 years until i tore the screen this is the best shaver i have ever used shaves fast and clean its cheap enough that i will buy another one rather than replace the screen do n't like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it	14
1	shaves great wet or dry i like it because it pivots real good no cuts it was worth every penny	14
1	i have tried many brands of soy shakes and this one is delicious i sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy cookies cream flavor tastes like a real shake ! ! i really enjoy this drinks	14
1	the product is very good do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes but still we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes it 's a good buy	14
1	i bought this bag for my husband as a surprise \( as i had bought another brand and he did not like the asian floral print \) it 's very roomy looks great fits ergonomically i really love the pocket design and the space that they have as well as the interior design fits things better than my own bag ! my husband loves it and ca n't wait to use it ! plus that this is the best price i 've seen online and of course amazon ships quickly and accurately	14

1	i have on the advice of my ob gyn been using dove \( white \) for over 25 years ! ! my skin is very sensitive and dry and he recommended i should use it instead of other brands he was not wrong ! it works very well for me	14
1	there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments i am glad i did the light from the mirror is bright the slide bar for the different light settings works very well if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out	14
1	this is a useful tool in that it makes the software hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack	14
1	dr bonners pepperming soap is our favorite our sensitive skin does not react it lasts a long time and best of all the peppermint aroma wakes up our senses in the mornings	14
1	smaller size did not fit me or my son it would be nice if you could use perhaps a hat size to determine right size standard size worked fine	14
1	i just bought a vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high i needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet these goggles are awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet and because the wrap around my head they stay put the magnets in front are very strong so the goggles do n't move the eye cups are just the right size and they 're padded for comfort these goggles have far exceeded my expectations	14
1	good for dust storms in desert like environments great for looking suave very convenient for easy on off	14
1	i have a waterpik that i 've used for years after a while the tips will break try finding them in a store not ! welcome amazon ! they have the waterpik replacement tips for a reasonable price if you go to waterpik online they double the price due to shipping ! ! ! amazon rocks	14
1	i love all the varieties of chocolate and if you mix them in a blender they are smooth and creamy you can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake shaking by hand or using a hand held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice these are a great meal replacement healthy nutritious and full of quality protein	14
1	i have n't used it thoroughly yet but from what i have seen so far it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress i am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use i use it daily to track my body fat and weight so far used it for only myself have n't checked it out for more than 1 users	14
1	this thing is really cool and works very easily once you performthe 10 minute setup and enter your info \( once \) you just step onit and tell it what setup number your are and it takes and saves the measurement it seems very steady and well built and i think it should last a long time	14
1	this scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office easy to monitor weight and fat	14
1	this handy little device has be a lifesaver in helping to remind me to take my pills it is easy to set up just put in the of hours between your doses 12 or 24 hours for twice a day or once a day medications i use two of these the timer counts down the hours and then chirps when you silence the alarm it automatically starts the countdown again the storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when i travel most of the time i just use it to remind me to take my pills i wish i knew about this a long time ago	14
1	this product does wonders it helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week like another customer i have sensitive skin i did n't feel this dried my skin out at all but a word to the wise make sure to read the directions carefully this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints if used properly its fantastic	14
1	i love the medi beads products and highly recommend them although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto gel i love the moist heat and the weight of the pads i used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients i only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back but 2 of the king sized pads will do it microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave	14
1	i 've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that does n't either streak or damage the lenses especially with ar and other coatings they put on glasses these days the sharper image eyeglass cleaner does the trick it also by design cleans your frames which is a plus i would have given 4 5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses i have two pair \( regular and sunglasses \) so no real fault there i recommend getting a 3m microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied	14
1	the sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful ! it does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it and it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours the light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well	14
1	finally tried this and i definitely recommend it it doesnt have a strong smell very pleasant and neutral it feels so good on your skin after you shave very soothing and moisturizing try some you 'll love it	14
1	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out while i do n't use it everday i use it regularly and when needed i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated this nivea after shave is wonderful it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on it gets your day off to a great start no funky smells or textures here give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
1	my wife found the women 's version of this cologne in bermuda and it smells great so i happen to see the man 's version of her cologne and tried it and thought it was great as well fruity yet woodsey smell hard to describe girls will eat it up !	14
1	i started taking anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work i am not usually a stressed out sort of person however i recently got transfered to nyc and i'm from utah just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out i am working as a trader and it is very high energy anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here	14

1	after a few months of debating whether or not i needed the extra light for my work space i made the great choice of purchasing the happylite i 've been using it the past few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark corner better than a regular lamp now my only concern is how to order an extra bulb \( guess i should read the materials it came with \)	14
1	no problems like the small format bottle easy to store works as well as anything else	14
1	great smell worth the cost cleans great i have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy	14
1	i bought this for my father in law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old my mother in law at sixty seven does n't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and cannot wield a full size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry the light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments i would n't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however it 's not as easy to use as a full size standard wheelchair this is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage	14
1	lightweight easy to transport easy to put together just remember the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own someone must be able to push but what a great product	14
1	my mother is 87 and the shower chair makes it easier she likes it in the tub better and i just use warm water poured over her	14
1	i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed	14
1	very handy and portable fits my neck good and i can even walk around with it on and not worry about it falling off or moving	14
1	this product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair this has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron ! i would give this product 10 stars if it were available ! my hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by chi i absolutely recommend this to anyone	14
1	i am 100 satisfied with this product and it has already earned me what i paid for i am able to trim my front portion of hair with this on my own where as for a complete trim i do need my wife 's assistance if you trim on a regular basis ie when the hair 's not over grown you will definitely find the job more easier i recommend it to everyone who wants to save on their haircuts the price is a good deal too if you buy from amazon else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the thanks giving sale	14
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle it has no flavor i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !	14

1	this is a great value probably one of the best shower heads i 've used yes there are better ones for 100 but this is absolutely amazing	14
1	this is a truly amazing deal from amazon where i also received free priority mail shipping the photo does not display all that you will get you will receive 6 boxes of q tips cotton swabs totaling an ammazing 3 500 q tips in all i will never ever have to purchase another q tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !	14
1	this curling iron works well it heats quickly and i'm very satisfied	14
1	i just bought this iron and i could n't be happier it 's the perfect size and weight the plates are n't unmanageably large or pitifully small it heats up incredibly fast we 're talking in less than 60 seconds i have short ish wavy and coarse hair it 's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes hai is a brand used in many salons and it 's all for a reason they make fantastic flat irons if you bought this same iron at a salon you could easily pay upwards of 150 in canada so i consider this price an awesome deal	14
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review it is an excellent dryer the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers however since it dries my hair fast my arms do n't mind the weight \) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !	14
1	in the past i bought hair dryers at target because of the prices i had no idea that a few more bucks can buy you a quality hair dryer that surpasses any conair sassoon etc purchased at this and similar stores the difference in the quality is noticed immediately upon use although the bb pro is a little heavier than i'm used to it dries hair faster and with fewer frizzes it 's amazing	14
1	i purchased this dryer for my wife it took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting my wife 's hair is thick and long so she did n't want get anything below 2000 watts this one is light powerfull and handy i strongly recommend it	14
1	i am so happy with aquasana shower filter i live in a building where the water is so harsh and sometimes discolored as a consequence my skin shortly turned dry and i continuously got skin problems i even thought about buying drinking water to clean my face everyday now that i have found aquasana i feel so happy it does what it promises i could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first time and it did feel like showering in natural spring water i could n't be happier with this product	14
1	compared to the olive aloe bar this one seems to lather better	14
1	this is excellent i like the ease of using it and the digital read out is great i highly recommend this produc	14
1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one this is an excellent product my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good lol and eyelining is a breeze though he would never admit it my husband uses also \( trimming mustash nose hairs \( eewww \) shaving etc \) great product order one you will not be dissapointed !	14
1	not a bad product irritates the skin a little but does remove your hair the only things i do n't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks it does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places not a bad product however i hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time i would recommend this product	14
1	really strong when just sprayed but after a little while it gets soft but at the same time not too soft the perfume lasts for few hours by the time i go to bed the scent would still be there faintly and i fall asleep to it it is fresh and strong at first then soft and sweet love it	14
1	tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market thank you amazon for carrying it	14
1	i love that stuff ! and now you have n't had it but i need more please make it available again thanks	14
1	received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option shop rite sells individual box for 8 99 so even the regular price of 32 beat that the 10 additional promotion was icing on the cake	14
1	purchased a case of bally energy drink since i seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept making excuses not to work out gets me up and at em' and no more excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym ! drank 1 can in the morning 5 30 am and another around 3pm give it a try	14
1	this has an average scent i have bought other brands of reed diffusers that i like alot more i would not buy this again	14
1	nice mirror good magnification solid construction my only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall i had to move a picture to position it at the correct height	14
1	i got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base the charger part of the trimmer is just too big even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments he would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for	14
1	just bought this showerhead i have a stand up shower built in with a pull around curtain all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor this is the one it works great i have a shallow well pump with 40 60lbs of water pressure setting my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub	14
1	i got this showerhead for christmas and am really happy with it ! ! it 's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you i do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place but with mine anyways it stays in place while i'm using it and it 's only later that it slowly lowers down then i just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when i want to use it it has n't been any trouble so far i love this showerhead so much that i'm actually already looking for an even larger one ! ! i highly recommend these rainfall showerheads !	14
1	pik stik reacher grabber did exactly what it said i used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard i'm 5'4 and did not have to bend over to pick up things it picks up coins small pieces of paper as well as jars and leaves gumballs from outdoors i am completely satisfied	14
1	i had a horrible cold felt like complete but i had to work this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad it tastes like a melted freeze pop note it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach	14
1	recieved product on time and i wil for sure order from this company agai	14
1	i have owned and broken most grabbers on the market the fold up gopher is a joke another with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use and the heavy duty unit from lowes is hard on the wrist this unit is the smart way to go ! it is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist also it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man no bending at the lumbar required	14
1	my mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds birds ect but all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noise and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street this is the only sound we need ! we bought it for our 3 month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up she slep great from day one now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual bath jammies book sleepy machine and off to sleep she goes	14
1	we originally got this to replace the fan noise in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold the first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it we 've discovered it 's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night with the adjustability dials it 's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan it does n't however cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise especially for children	14
1	this is the best sound machine out there i worked in a doctors office where they used these and they were amazing my husband cannot sleep without some sort of white noise we purchased this and our sleep could n't be better best bet for the money it 's also adjustable as far as volume just twist the top very quick shipping as well	14
1	que maravilla comprar por amazon com todo llego en perfecto estad	14
1	i purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two inch threshold to our house and it has done that but i wish now that i had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline i use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair 's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house it was easy to install however with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable	14
1	i like this kit very much and my colleague are going to purchase it when they saw mine	14
1	for years i have had many a vacation ruined because i break out in hives with very little exposure to the sun after my dermatologist recommended this product i tried it two vacations later not a single hive or sunburn well worth the price actually goes pretty far also	14
1	did n't work if you dont take the full recommended amount it may have helped me feel fuller but it didnt help me lose any weight i pulled out the old excersize bike and am plugging away at a low 20 min a day now i still use it for the caffeien and possible apetite control benefit	14
1	i was having a problem with over eating and eating when i was n't hungry and as a result gained quite a bit of weight and felt awful i 've only been using this product for three days but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up i have n't felt jittery or shaky i feel better than i have in months i would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un needed weight	14
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one	14
1	i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did this one gives me a really good shave i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud which it is but since you turn it on and leave it i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem	14
1	i bought this obus forme king sized pillow because i thought it might stop my snoring i must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely there have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first i found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive my wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it i have just ordered a second pillow	14
1	these are great glasses easy to put on and take off and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some amazon was the place to go	14
1	the product smells really good is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day i highly recommend trying it i will make it part of my daily hairdress \( grooming \) for life !	14
1	i bought this straightner at walmart for about the same price found on amazon and i really like it i bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does i wanted a chi but i could n't pass this one up for the price i 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well a good product for the price ! !	14
1	i bought this for my husband he had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years	14
1	nv diet pills are working great for me i lost 8lbs in a month ! ! ! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills it is n't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and do n't work out of course nothing is going to happen they really do control hunger because i take 2 a day and one day i was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and i was starving looking to eat anything and everything in sight	14
1	great piece of equipment no guessing how accurate the scale might be with this great healthometer	14
1	we use these in all of our humidifiers and they do a great job	14
1	this is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful	14
1	i love them ! i have a fairly expensive 6 piece lithograph and each piece is about 15 lbs we were not only able to hang them with minimal damage to the drywall but have them almost perfectly abutting each other	14
1	they taste good and stop those hunger pangs for quite some time	14
1	i read in one of the magazines that many stars in hollywood eat chocolateto lose weight i thought that was some kind of cruel joke until i readthat the chocolate they eat is with hoodia but i could not find the namefor those chocolates i searched the internet and was i happy to find chocoleans ! i was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place and had one chocoleanbefore i left the house it worked ! i could barely finish two sushi 's and i felt soo full now i eat one or two chocoleans a day with water or coffee and eat soomuch less ! i already lost two dress sizes amazing and they are sooo delicious	14
1	i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this great product ! !	14
1	this is the best bargain for your money pampers swaddlers are better than pampers even better than costco brand worth every penny	14
1	these are the best diapers i have used they are soft flexible and easily adjustable for a good secure fit they hold leaks extremely well of course leaks do occur \( why would n't they if your baby has say for example 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes it 's happened \) however this is to be expected they do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection i highly recommend these	14
1	the magnet is solid the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows lenses are clear and functional however they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads since it can get snug and this is not your usual glasses notice that the frame encircles the head making head size an issue on the plus side the glasses wo n't fall off when you bend forward they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em and they are functional	14
1	i had my original clic readers for about six years before i had to replace them i love the quality of the lenses the ease of use and the fact that i do not have to remember where i put them when i took them off i never take them off and have even ordered several pair for other people at work i am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while find them to be one of the most useful tools i own	14
1	these glasses are a great idea however they do not work with long hair the back strap of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose \( so you can see over them for distance \) long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair	14
1	i loved this product really leaves my hair really straight without even blow drying ! ! i have curly hair and it worked pretty well my hair was smooth and shiny i'm very happy with my straightener	14
1	i like this product a lot my hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath i used this product and my hair looks good now it looks smooth and straight now and i can feel the softness when i touch my hair i definitely will recommend this product to my friends	14
1	i normally have severe pain in my neck especially when i first get up in the morning causing extremely painful headaches and migraines this pillow has kept my neck in a suitable position eliminating about 70 90 of my problems	14
1	i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago the pain was gone after the first night and it has n't come back since then it supports my neck perfectly i highly recommend	14
1	i 've been relying on this lotions for over a decade of the many i 've tried it 's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long lasting moisturizing some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive especially on hands but if you have skin as dry as mine you 'll tolerate a minute or two of greasiness for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours these comments are for neutrogena emulsion only neutrogena body lotion did not work well for me	14
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs at age 70 those needs are many after approximately two rounds of trying it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general	14
1	bumble bumble products are a special me treat for pampering the shampoo is mild and keeps my long permed hair in great shape	14
1	i have several of these glasses now love them they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one good price and good product	14
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
1	i wanted a cordless shaver because at my age \( 49 \) i need my glasses on to see the hairs i'm shaving and that does n't work well in the shower ! this braun is a good buy easy to use and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly it 's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel but it 's quicker and less mess so i think it 's a good trade off	14
1	the ultrasonic aromatheropy fountain is really unique the sound generated yet unheard causes water to spring up from the surface 3 4 inches to provide a fountain like water sound at the same time the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on all the while led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors the construction was just a little light duty other than that very nice	14
1	i 've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works never falls apart and cut hair great i 'd buy another if this one would ever wear out !	14
1	i really like this curling iron and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! it heats up very quickly and gives me great curls the key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair then after you curl make sure to take a blowdryer on cold low setting to lock the curls down i always receive so many compliments on my hair ! !	14
1	i am a big fan of 2 curling irons but they can be difficult to find my last one \( different brand \) wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now i have shoulder length hair fairly thick plus wavy and frizzy 2 curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair while also turning it under \( or up if desired \) at the ends for a nice finished look i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat straight iron while achieving superior results you will not get curl with this curling iron you will get smooth hair quickly and easily highly recommended	14
1	after brushing with the hydrabrush my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist this is a great product i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon	14
1	una de las mejores compras que he hecho es facil de manejar y deja el cabello liso y con brillo es fantastica	14
1	what i like best is that it is non addictive it puts you right to sleep within 20 30 minutes it really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep patterns	14
1	sedamine is great sleep aid i 've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and i tried nearly everything including old remedies i thought i would go crazy if i did n't find help not sleeping has been awful since end of july i started with the sedamine product and it started working right way i tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone	14
1	i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store with school and all it 's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight i 've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early !	14
1	we have a closet shower which made it difficult to get out of the way of the water spray \( not to mention having water spray out the door \) we picked up this neat little shower head and we 're much happier now you can avoid the water more easily \( for shaving washing body etc \) and since it aims straight down no more turning the shower head all the way to the side to avoid it going right out the door it 's inexpensive and has made our shower experience much better i definitely recommend it	14
1	i have had this model for years ! and i cut my hair with it 3 4 times a month between me my sons it is the best clipper set i have ever owned most clippers i buy only last 1 2 years i have had this one i think 5 6 years ! well worth the money	14
1	this was my first purchase of seventh generation products and it wo n't be my last one i was very impressed with the cleaning and it is just as good as those not so earth friendly competitors i feel good using their products and have also ordered their fabric softner dishwasher liquid dishwashing liquid bleach paper towels and toilet paper i'm not a treehugger but do care about my environment and feel a duty to make earth a better place to be	14
1	it 's pretty good do n't see it making anything firmer but it works nicely as a moisturizer i checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing about it ruining their life all over the net probably an allergic reaction you always have to test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your eyes	14
1	i have over 60 mens fragrances that range from 50 00 to 320 00 and found that i get more compliments when i wear this fragrance than any other fragrance that i wear as well as having an risque appealing bottle great must have for any man	14
1	i found this product to be very unique and helpful in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck being far sighted i have come to need reading glasses and these are perfect for my needs i can look 'down' through them and look 'over the frame' for distance all while they are secured around my head and neck i do hiking using a gps device and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand while also looking forward towards my path of travel thank you for the innovative product	14
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is every time i look up the magnets pop apart if they fix that i 'd give them 5 stars ! !	14
1	my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would n't want this new much more attractive kind it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large we put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great what more can you ask	14
1	i ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well pleased it is much less expensive than comparable walkers the cushioned seat and basket are handy for long trips and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas a good buy for someone looking for a quality walker even ships for free	14
1	this product rocks if you are serious about body building this is a must have i 've been using no explode about two weeks and seen some serious enhanchments first of my workout lasts at least an hour longer than usual and still have energy left over combine this product with the right amount of protein shake you are good to go also note that this product does not cause any stomach cramping or aching like other creatine products do and tastes great	14
1	this the best product out there for preventing and ridding red bumps ingrown hairs and the other unslightly skin hair irritations	14
1	these wipes are great i have three children and have used the pampers huggies and house brand wipes the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done house brand do n't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough the pampers are thin soft and moist enough to get the job done because they are thin they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded refolded for 100 useage \( unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver \) definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said if you want something moister go get a paper towel and wet it with water	14
1	the shampoo does n't lather but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day and it seems to be doing it 's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch free since i started using it so i would recommend it	14
1	my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the stree	14
1	i have three types of headlamps and i like this one the most here is why 1 \) it 's cheap 2 \) it runs a long time on three aaa batteries and 3 \) the red light is awesome you can use the red light and still keep your night vision i use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light my only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing even after two years of use i often have to twist twice to get the right setting and i'm usually good at that stuff	14
1	fantastic a great product especially considering the price i love the size i love that the height is adjustable it is exactly what i wanted and i am thrilled with it	14
1	i love the taste of these little chocolates i find that i need to have one 1 hour before eating less and they do n't work if i have two in one day \( late morning mid afternoon \) the effect is cumalative i can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied	14
1	i absolutely love this little book light it is so slim and easy to store plus i can use it for my magazines and paperbacks i highly recommend this item a	14
1	this is exactly what i needed for my macbook computer it 's comfortable and keeps my laptop from sliding around great	14
1	although i am a writer who composes on the computer i often do my editing on hard copy in a comfortable chair until i started using the posture rite lap desk i could not do this comfortably now i have it it fits my lap perfectly i use it and love it i recommend it highly	14
1	i use and like most all of the olay lines of products this one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well i ca n't wait for the one that has a hint of tan in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market i heard about it but apparently it is not out as of yet	14
1	i carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back and as a result get a lot of headaches i have been using the real ease for about two months and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches i have not used it as a preventative only when i already have a headache if something happened to the one i have i would definitely buy another	14
1	dr riter 's real ease is a simple gentle and healing neck support it is effective easy to use and affordable it helped healing post accident and with general body pain healing and relaxation	14
1	after just 3 weeks of using this product my fasting blood sugar has dropped to 111 thats over 40 points ! ! ! ! pretty impressive my dr started me on metformin but it made me very sick this stuff works much better wiht no side effects i wish i had known about this years ago as i have been fighting with high fasting sugars for years this product is a god send	14
1	this is a great tool this help people to get back on track physically it is hard to find effective training tools this one is great for those who need back door training simple to use and rock hard ! up yours	14
1	i really like this product it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped the neutrogena has helped 100 when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !	14
1	i'm not sure how well since i have never used anything like this before but my bath water feel a whole lot better and i do not itch for an hour afterwards i probably should have rated a 5 star but i really have no base for comparing i will definitely buy this product again	14
1	saved my love life literally it worked for me in a couple days and though its a tad pricey well worth the money doesnt burn or sting either if only all other stuff i used worked this good i coulda had a date to the prom cause i tried everything thanks princereign	14
1	i found this product to be very unique and helpful in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck being far sighted i have come to need reading glasses and these are perfect for my needs i can look 'down' through them and look 'over the frame' for distance all while they are secured around my head and neck i do hiking using a gps device and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand while also looking forward towards my path of travel thank you for the innovative product	14
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is every time i look up the magnets pop apart if they fix that i 'd give them 5 stars ! !	14
1	i have nothing bad to say it gets hot enough it was cheap it seems well made the cover is washable it 's just what i was looking for	14
1	as a reviewer of the hitachi magic wand i can say that this accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord perhaps just not as powerfull as the hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off as mentioned it does the job	14
1	while some of larabars have a thick grainy nut texture this particular product is very smooth and almost tastes like chocolate candy for those of us who ca n't eat real candy because of allergies this one is a winner ! it almost tastes like a soft girl scout thin mint cookie	14
1	old spice classic is far and away the best deodorant i 've ever used it goes on clean unlike those powdery white deodorants it also has a great fragrance and longevity after application i think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content if you look at the ingredients you 'll see that alcohol is listed first in fact the container sports a flammable warning the alcohol really does work well to contain odor alcohol based deodorants are pretty hard to find so i'm thankful this product is still being made	14
1	this shaver is the best shaver i have ever used it gives me the closest shave it is very comfortable to hold it is great my brother in law liked it so much he bought one	14
1	yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad saludos rafael desde cabimas venezuel	14
1	this is the best shaver i 've ever used it shaves closer and quicker than the many norelcos i 've used all of which costed a lot more than the r 960 the only improvement i 'd like to see is in the battery which does not really maintain its strength well between charges	14
1	this is a great shaver if you are in the market for one considered the remington r 960 i am of afro american descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver i had always gotten excellent results using remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug with its ergonomic design it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas i had considered purchasing that of another brand until i discovered that remington makes one and now i'm loving it	14
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom and i do n't have any trouble sleeping i use to wake up at least 2 3 times a night and have the hardest time getting back to sleep i hardly ever wake up at all now great product and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep	14
1	i bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money it really is ! after using this the recomended 15 minuets my feet felt just like they did when i had a professional foot massage ! i highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged	14
1	i was n't sure what to expect when i 1st tried this two part microdermabrasion peel kit i use it twice a week and what a difference it has made on my skin the only thing is i wish they made a bigger bottle of the peel mariann	14
1	a friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful glowing face from a 50 00 facial she had just received this product \( even after the 1st use \) produced the same results i never had to leave my home my skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat my skin feels looks like i 've lost about 7 years time i'm very very pleased with olay i 've used their total effects lotion for years i did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit this is an excellent exfoliant hands down the best skin regenerating product i 've ever used	14
1	i 've been using regenerist daily for 6 months i added the peel system this past month what a change ! i'm 60 my skin has clarity i have n't seen in years pores close up small lines and wrinkles really do seem to disappear i 'll stick with this from now on	14
1	after going back and forth between oil of olay and neutrogena i settled on this product mostly because of the price \( plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes \) i'm happy with the results my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity the orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes \( i do it in the shower \) of course it 's not microdermabrasian but it is a great exfolliater for your skin	14
1	i love this product it just tastes great especially with milk	14
1	we used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently as a previous reviewer stated sometimes it works sometimes not so i combined it with the recommended dosage for infant gas drops and that would do the trick i found little tummy 's brand at babies r us which is less expensive and is the same thing later after 6 months and trying new foods there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something did n't agree with her i gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she 'd clearly feel better	14
1	delivers moist heat great large size you wo n't find anything larger anywhere very relaxing as lavender is calming only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes i have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min and lied down with head neck in comfortable position and it did a great job pricey but worth it	14
1	received the monitor quickly it works well the automatic feature is great	14
1	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results the size of the cuff is very important so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results this is true in the doctors office also my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office on his machine just by changing the size of the cuff this is an excellent monitor i could n't be happier with it it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too	14
1	i ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out loved it so i ordered a full and kingsize too ! i find i do n't move around as much as i used to a more restfull sleep	14
1	this is a very good product it helps prolong the life of the electric razor	14
1	i 've used this for quite some time now and really like it i do n't have the trouble with the toilet flushing that others seem to but i suppose if you have one of those one gallon regulated toilets you 'd probably have some trouble with this paper it is thicker and tons softer but it does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses running cat 's eyes cleaning the bathroom sink mirror you name it it 's pretty strong stuff and i highly recommend it	14
1	i 've been using remington 's shaver saver for 20 years it keeps your shaver clean lubricates well with not too much gooey oil and works in an instant i use a remington ms2 100 microscreen 2 and after a shaver saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer a treatment seems to last for a while and i do n't think it 's necessary to use it every day usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new	14
1	i bought this to go with my ms2 200bpt shaver i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well i 've been using it for about 1 month and i could n't agree more a quick spray on the cutters after shaving and the next time i use it it runs like new i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i 've started using it as a bonus it seems to last quite a while another strong product from remington	14
1	i have several of these glasses now love them they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one good price and good product	14
1	like the product very much comfortable and convenient i would recommend then if you have a small hat size do n't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag with the above i do n't have a problem the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed goggle like eye pieces on warm days i 've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye but have not done this as of jan 2007 i like them very innovative	14
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued \( like i could hardly move \) i had been taking a general multi vitamin from a local warehouse store i started taking the nature 's plus source of life and i felt so much better my energy level has increased dramatically and i just feel good great quality product	14
1	very nice scale worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh	14
1	i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it so now i'm buying her one for her new ap	14
1	we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10 12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied	14
1	i purchase two of the eva dry edv 500 renewable dehumidifer and hang them inside the closet where i store my photo gears although in california is not so humid but little moisture do add up this dehumidifer is so easy to use unwrap it then hang it there i check them once per several day when the silica gel change from blue to pick i just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight then next morning wow a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again the changing of color is very obviously i strongly recommend this item	14
1	the product was a gift for my mother who needs extra circulation in her feet she loves it and it has helped increase the circulation	14
1	mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well i like the way this cream gives instant glow	14
1	i love this soap it 's a little big and hard to hold during shower but the smell totally makes up for it ! it has a very strong \( but good \) grapefruit smell it 's very fresh and rinses completely off	14
1	the dispencer is easy to squeeze amount of moisturizer needed for one application consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply it 's very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist uv and aging ! very convenient but just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion	14
1	i bought from the 3 types of olay total effect and i did try them after reading the instruction there is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence the company was very good in logistic maters	14
1	i used aveeno moisturizer and thought i would try something new i have eczema on my face \( around my eyes nose and mouth \) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days my skin is very sensitive and have experienced burning with other products but not this one i sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy yet strong enough to tackle dry skin i highly recommend it	14
1	purchased 15 15hp15rb heating pads that are used by dialysis patients they are doing great	14
1	this is my first electric shaver and i am very pleased with the results use the trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to make it smooth no knicks no cuts ! ! ! i am pleased !	14
1	it took a while to get this product but it was worth the wait the iron heats up quickly and easily when you have arthritis like me you appreciate the simplicities in this product it heated up fast and safely and it was so easy to grip the handle it definitely styled my hair without over processing it thanks	14
1	optimum nutrition 's 100 whey protein is hands down the best i have tried and i have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years i used to be committed to eas and labrada but i found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to on whey protein i mix it with water and sometimes soy milk it mixes easy does n't taste gritty and is pure protein it goes down very easy and i have no trouble digesting it plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan plus the price is reasonable	14
1	i have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout for meal replacement to keep up protein intake i read alot about mixing whey with coconut water that is how i have been taking it \( blended with a couple ice cubes \) if you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take i do i actually look forward to the shake	14
1	tastes great and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me	14
1	if i could give this product over five stars i would ! i get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when i finally got this product in one of the starter kits burt 's bees makes and i was hooked i use this with their marshmallow vanishing cream and my skin feels and looks great i have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles i always have when i use the royal jelly cream though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems	14
1	all there products are great ! they smell good and are good lathering is a more work but thats because they 're natural i use them on my babies and toddlers	14
1	i bought this as a trial product because the other stuff that i bought did n't work as what they advertise it but this dusters picks up the dust instead of pushing to another place this refills is quite cheap and it make my cleaning job much easier	14
1	i am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of clics i own if you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on ! i 'dlook at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer lastly i 've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use	14
1	i started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by consumer 's report within a few weeks i could see measurable improvement in my skin sure not all the deep wrinkles went away but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58 year old skin looks younger my skin feels so much smoother and looks fresh i 've had a lot of sun exposure from living in australia south texas and florida so i'm thrilled to find a cream that does such a good job lots cheaper too than many skin creams	14
1	my grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist i started to use it and fell in love with it i have suffered with acne my entire life and i have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically i have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night these both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics which has been a problem due to my skin texture	14
1	love this product have been using oil of olay before it was heard of by most this is more advanced and makes my skin look and feel more youthful	14
1	i bought this item for my husband for christmas he has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him we use these pillows everyday sitting up watching tv and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps the only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores !	14
1	i am a foot reflexologist and i highly recommend this product it is very helpful in working the reflexes on the bottom of the feet	14
1	kama sutra massage oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff ! keeps the skin so smooth and the girlfriend happy lol just make sure you warm it up alittle before squirting it on you will live longer	14
1	this sunscreen has the important components to give you uva and uvb protection it goes on smooth for a sunscreen that uses titanum dioxide for its protection agent my kids love that the bottle turns color when uva rays touch it indicating that sunscreen is necessary	14
1	this works better than any other women 's shaver i 've ever used it does give a close shave without irritating the skin	14
1	i was unsure if this product would be as good as the one sold at brookstone it is great ! just as good as the ijoy sold at brookstone but much cheaper i love it	14
1	i am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk yet i need to work and that means that i have to be standing long hours so when i tried your leg massagers i was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use i now use it every chance i get my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well it is one of the best purchases i have made it was worth the investment	14
1	i thought this was convenient and easy to use seemed to give a pretty accurate reading	14
1	loving this air purifier ! this was really the first one i have own so i ca n't compare it to any others it is very quite and takes alot of dust out of the air the first time i had to replace the filter i was shocked by how much dust i could of been breathing in worth picking up just wish it would of had an energy star label	14
1	my youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis i bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust mold pollen ect she has been using this product for three \( 3 \) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time we have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product highly recommeded	14
1	i have been using this for my face for over 10 years it is very inexpensive \( especially compared to other cosmetic brands \) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin i also used it on my 3 kids it comes in handy on the changing table especially when the wipes were not quite wet enough to do the job ! it is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing it can just be wiped off without leaving any residue it is very gentle even for newborn 's skin	14
1	this product perfrorms as expected and very easy to clean with almost not maintenance it also has an adjust dial for the humidity which gives you some control love the machin	14
1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
1	this was bought as a gift for my dad who has limited mobility it 's easy for him to use easy to handle and gives him a great shave he really likes it	14
1	i love the olay regenerist line ! moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth you will see a big difference after the first use ! i 've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it 's great	14
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation at night it 's all you need	14
1	i 've tried many a serum potion lotion cream every over the counter fit it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had ! i know iknow there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting but i 've yet to see it	14
1	i got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and i thought they 'd improve upon the mach3 well they did ! this turbo brand of mach 3 is actually much better his shave lasts longer the blades last longer and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave i choose this one over that mach3 power vibrating blade because i do n't know a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion haha he 's very happy with it and likes the shave and speaking about money if the shave and blades last longer than before it 's a great value ! highly suggested ! !	14
1	i have used opti free enzymatic cleaner for years still with the same great results i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer because my using extended wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock	14
1	it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores i do n't know what you mean by give your review a titl	14
1	purchased as a christmas gift for a friend who uses this product he was excited to receive this i was excited that i was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices this same product in a smaller size retails for 45 55 locally and i was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than 30 this particular item by davidoff is not always easy to find and i was glad to not only find it here but to find it at such a reasonable price	14
1	this product is great for injury and leg elevation my grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her legs do n't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good my grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs my mother has fibromayalgia and i'm ordering two for her as well she test drove them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her	14
1	i am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because i constantly burn i have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied i went on my honeymoon to the maldives in november and was able to stay out in the sun go swimming and i did not have to constantly reapply i did n't get burned once ! bull frog superblock is the best sunblock around	14
1	have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area 's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using spf 45 or better that is a misconception why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning found best result 's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun	14
1	the chair has simple pre set programs \( i basically use only the full body massage \) but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the 2 500 chairs but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value	14
1	i find this product to be very good for calfs one of the best foot massagers i 've ever tried the one drawback is that it tends to slide away from you when you are using it on your feet i would reccommend it	14
1	it works very well i bought it for my wives calves she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick using this product her calves become soft and getting thin i 've used it too i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation	14
1	these hair brushes were the rage when i was in junior high i have had one since then it is a great brush and lasts forever worth the price	14
1	bought it works really good such a fun thing to have laying around and was very pleased well worth the 50 it costed me at brookstone	14
1	this is a wonderfull massager i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one for 50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right	14
1	i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so	14
1	this would be a perfect curling iron if heated to a slightly higher temperature it takes a little longer to curl my hair because of the lower temperature	14
1	works great no problems after 4 months	14
1	this product does a surprising job for its low price it gives my hair so much body and softness and is extremely easy to use gets plenty hot enough	14
1	great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne i began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago it helped clear up teen acne has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years	14
1	i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately 9 00 22 00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon	14
1	panasonic makes a great electric shaver this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years	14
1	i am a woman of color and this product eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my combination skin i highly recommend this product for women who need to brighten their appearance once a week after 5 years i continue to use this and the pumpkin exfoliating mask the papaya is good as well	14
1	this is the 2nd year that i have used the neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock spf 45 i have normal to oily sensitive acne prone skin i am fair and can burn easily i think this product is well worth the money it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel it does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out i apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours the time will vary depending on your sun tolerance though it is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile	14
1	my kids really liked how it did n't feel like suntan lotion	14
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick even in the middle of the holidays i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed	14
1	i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress it was pretty pungent but it felt so good the first time i layed in it after a couple days it appeared to lose it 's memory and start to dent and crease but eventually it got back to full expansion the customer service with this item was fantastic ! we 'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory	14
1	this sinus rinse works great and it 's easy to use great price from amazon and quick shipping	14
1	so far this dryer is working great ! another brand did n't last 1 year so i hope this one lasts longer	14
1	i 've tried a lot of different nutrition and energy bars and these are my favorites \( along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry \) great taste a nice texture \( sort of like nestle crunch \) and much more satisfying than candy bars almost as tasty as girl scout thin mints but not as fat and guilt inducing	14
1	i have tried a gazillion of these diet protein bars this is the only one i 've actually found so far that tastes good	14
1	good product does what it says however it could smell better it has almost no scent you smell clean but it has almost no scent other than that it feels great lathers great leaves your skin feeling nice and it clears your skin up	14
1	this give an excellent finish to a shave i strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well apply hot water to dilate your pores then apply the oil then shaving cream shave and finally the after shave balm the oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience your face feels incredibly smooth afterward i do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone but i do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after	14
1	i knew a man who once wore this classic cologne and always smelled so good i bought it for my hubby this christmas and instantly remembered why i loved that smell so much it is a classic frangrance not stinky or overpowering but fresh there are other vetiver cologne 's out there but they smell nothing like the guerlain from france it 's a gorgeous smell and i guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering it 's smooth and mellow fresh	14
1	this is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points the knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots but generally does the job	14
1	i say the scale is pretty good and accurate but the fat keep changing different in the morning and night like in the morning i got 30 2 and at night it say i got 25 8 i dont really trust the fat but the pound is very accurate for the price i would rather get something cheaper	14
1	today is 3 19 07 this item is labeled as being purchased on 3 21 07 will i purchase another order on that date	14
1	the neutrogena norwegian formula foot creme was a dream for this mother my 7 year old was unfortunate enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands and feet the problem is so severe in his father that his father 's hands and feet are literally split open and very painful the 7 year old has already started with very hard calluses and nothing seems to relieve them nothing that is until now just a small nightly dose seems to be helping immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet i would expect a 7 year old to have i highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry cracked feet	14
1	you could n't have picked a better person to test drive this product i have severely dried and callused heals from the moment i put the creme on my feet they felt smoother the creme stays on for hours like the product says i ca n't believe the difference it 's made in such a short time i 'll definitely buy this product and i 'll be recommending it to my mom whose feet are drier than mine are	14
1	this is the best investment ever ! they start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin it was so easy to set up start enjoying i 've used it on average twice a week and my feet hands are so wonderfully moist even in this winter weather my heels are no longer cracked my cuticles are so healthy not snagging at all thank you for this perfect product so much cheaper than going to the salon ! it 's so relaxing \( i use lavender \) as i do this just before bed	14
1	i did n't think i would like the fragrance but it 's absolutely wonderful it 's not too sweet or strong it smells good on my daughters and me give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
1	we all have from time to time brought those heavy bottle of liquid detergent to the washing machine and breaking our backs in the process thankfully all small mighty might be a unique solution it is a concentrated detergent that works with the capacity of a traditional 100 ounce bottle i like it because it really does a great job at cleaning clothes that have n't been completely spotless from all those tough messes from other methods i really think that everyone should own this product because it saves a lot of headaches while being true to its price that 's all ! price b convience a overall b	14
1	maybe because i ordered a medium it works fine otherwise i recommend it	14
1	very convenient reading glasses you could hang them on your neck when not using them and not even notice they are there they are very sturdy and are flexible making them almost imposible to break cons both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair as the glasses would trap your hair against your face	14
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
1	i purchased this unit for my personal office at work its small and unobtrusive enough so as not to necessarily stand out its runs quietly and well operating on the highest setting for several hours	14
1	i have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help i bought big one for home and personal for work it 's been 2 days and it 's working fine	14
1	these wipes are awesome ! they got here real fast too !	14
1	it arrived in 3 days and i used it for a week and i still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and trust me i tried everything in the book a plus is my face is one even complexion when i had alot of dark spots which was a pleasant surprise	14
1	you know right away your teeth feel different much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning the dual action \( larger \) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly is n't as aggressive as the smaller one in it 's ability to clean if you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job the flossing attachment was also very effective	14
1	after brushing with the hydrabrush my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist this is a great product i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon	14
1	hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushhead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards i use the soft brushhead because i used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen but since using the hydrabrush and the 8 brushes \( 4 on each side \) i do n't have to worry about missing when i brush my teeth excellent product	14
1	i used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house ! this little sponge is awesome and it is just like a sponge it 's not abrasive the only problem i see with it \( and all cleaning products \) is that you actually have to use it for it to work lol	14
1	this product works great for water retention i like that it does n't keep you running to the ladies room works great	14
0	i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it i thought i could use this every other day and get by however it does n't make your hair look freshly washed it is just ok it takes bed head hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while after a couple of hours though my hair looks oily and stringy again i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning then i end up washing my hair later	15
0	i like jonathan anton some of his products but this one was a very bad one it smelled like swamp water his other products smell great i do n't know what happened to this one	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
0	i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it	15
0	jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you ca n't fool them twice i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two	15
0	on a scale of 1 to 5 the packaging gets a negative 1 you ca n't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle ended up removing top for value of product jonathan gets a 1 for quality of product 3 the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter need to use more than average the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair but no better than other quality brands i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time but bed head has a similar product that 's been out for a while for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price	15
0	jonathan should spent more time with scott from zorbitt because the packaging is second rate the product itself was subpar also	15
0	used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had not recommended at least for medium wavy hair no frizz control	15
0	unless you have a new softball glove to break in this product is not for you way way too much oil just nappy i might as well have put mayo in my hair	15
0	i had high hopes for this stuff i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves i have tried it on wet hair damp hair dry hair no discernable difference i will stick to my frederic fekkai products they actually work	15
0	i spent a lot of money on this product waited with anticipation for it to arrive when i applied it it did nothing to create curl and did n't even define the curls that i already had my hair was limp and frizzy by days end it smelled nice that 's about it cheap o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl	15
0	this hairspray was too wet and too stiff it ruined my clean freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker yuck ! ! ! ! i love the voluminizing shampoo conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam but when i lightly sprayed the finishing hair spray it ruined everything i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump sorry jonathan	15
0	if you buy this shampoo buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair i guarantee you will be disappointed it is the equivalent of herbal essence \( also leaves your hair like glue	15
0	this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day so i tried using another shampoo and used jonathan 's once a week the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo what a disappointment	15
0	is this shampoo or sap \? \? what exactly is it supposed to do \? \? i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it not only did my hair feel like straw as mentioned by other reviewers but it was so heavy i could n't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo i 'll save this one for halloween	15
0	i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out unfortunately i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess unfortunately the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that 's about it	15
0	i purchased this item after seeing jonathan 's show as much as i enjoyed his program i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible it weighed down my hair and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling ! the day after using the product my hair looked like an oil slick ! i do wish jonathan much success but these products need a lot of work very disappointing after spending almost 60 for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard	15
0	my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned i thought it was too drippy i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand i would not recommend this conditioner	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
0	this product totally frizzed out my hair i had been having good luck for once with paul mitchell 's foaming mousse this jonathan product sadly rather than taming my hair induced the frizz a lot perhaps a stronger formula is needed or maybe i just do n't have fine limp enough hair i was very sad	15
0	this product works well when i use it with a curling iron the low rating is for the cost i just do n't think it is worth over 20	15
0	product made my hair sticky and gooey i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market needs re formulatin	15
0	i have dried my hair daily for 20 years now i bought the t3 tourmaline with great excitement come on its 200 the most i have ever used on a hairdryer i did not reduce my hair drying time at all but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny but all in all too much money for too little help ! nor	15
0	i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality perhaps worth the price to some but i 'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness most ionic and infrared is gibberish tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties \( when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal \) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else i 'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	15
0	i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair will not purchase again	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
0	i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out and you find yourself rolling it over over again to get a decent amount of gloss the gloss itself is pretty \( once you get enough on your lips \) and it does taste smell delicious but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush it would make a great product	15
0	bought this to help myself achieve some punch with my existing waves all i got were crimps in wierd places found the instruction booklet completely not useful i tried and tried but could not produce anything remotely close to a wave curl etc save your money	15
0	not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw even my own sylist said whatever you are using stop you hair feels very damaged it goes back to normal texture if i use my other shampoos i made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the jonathan shampoo and it was it went into the trash do n't purchase this stuff unless you 're going for the scarecrow look	15
0	after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty is this a joke i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair with his very shampoo and all i have is tears clearly this is not product without tears	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
0	i received this as a gift i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since i only got to use it three times	15
0	this product did not dry my hair as described on the box it did straighten my hair but that was all i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it	15
0	on my third use i set it down on the carry case and it sizzled i looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord right where it is connected to the handle ! i immediately unplugged it and now there 's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out i am so grateful i was n't using it on my hair when this happened ! what with the straightening balm i was using and everything my hair could 've easily started on fire	15
0	i tried doing a patti labelle do where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it	15
0	this was terrible i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan like in something about mary splooge would have been cheaper and would have held bettah	15
0	i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k y jelly frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams	15

0	all of the glowing and raving reviews of this product were all entered on april 24 or april 25 coincidence \? i think not these are people paid by strivectin for their honest reviews	15
0	i bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work well it does n't i followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever i'm 24 23 when i tried the product no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all if it does n't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff i wish i had n't listened to the raves on this product	15
0	i find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review 1 has only ever reviewed one product on amazon2 all seem to have been posted on the 24th caveat emptor	15
0	i bought the cream hoping to get rid of or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy i have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results it smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts i was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews i'm now very disappointed if something sounds too good to be true it is	15
0	i used to love curious i asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion however a few months after i got it it started to smell funny over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it when i opened the bottle i gaged at the stench i poured it down the sink and it was yellow i do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please do n't buy it with the atomizer the lotion still smells good	15
0	like many others my perfume turned yellow as well i think it only happens with the atomizer perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf life i am never buying perfume from britney spears obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume	15
0	i immediately fell in love with the fragrance and my husband bought me the really big bottle i wanted to savor it and make it last much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol it also formed a nasty crusty substance all over the pump and bottle i am soooo disappointed ! ! !	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt	15
0	i just purchased the small bottle \( thank god \) of the ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner it seems like it made my hair a little softer but the smell is horrendous i have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product so overall it may make my hair feel softer but there is no way i will put this stuff on my head again the rest is going in the trash	15
0	i got this product as a sample it has the worst scent ever it took me 2 days of washing to get the horrible smell out of my hair	15
0	i do not like this shampoo at all in fairness i did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair it seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet the one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which i do love did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well	15
0	this thing was such a waste it does not get cold enough to do anything it also wo n't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes overpriced and worthless item	15
0	i ca n't believe how much amazon and other retail stores \( like sephora \) charge for this i buy prevage md \( which is double the strength of regular prevage \) from my plastic surgeon 's office and i only pay 120 why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff \? if you do n't want to go to the doctor to buy the md version then you can get it off ebay for around 100	15
0	i bought this product in the color paparazzi from sephora online i read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines i was very disappointed when i finally got it and tried it there is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13 i could not wear this to work or even an evening out as i would feel like a clown the only place this would look semi good at would be a nightclub where it is dark i was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter i do not recommend this product at all i also returned this promptly back to sephora	15
0	not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome 's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice	15
0	i was excited to try out this product given all the rave reviews but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash ! it 's awful ! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination i would not recommend this product	15
0	i have thick wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy i do n't think it is worth the money when i have found other poducts \( such as redken \) that work better and cost less	15
0	i was looking forward to receiving this body lotion however was very disappointed when i opened it and smelled the fragrance it smells exactly like paint then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint like scent i will not buy any more philosophy products the less expensive fragrances lotions are so much better that you buy from target wal mart etc	15
0	i love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel but this lotion is not getting as much love from me it does n't smell the same to me and on a bad day makes me a little sick it 's sweeter smelling thing is i need lotion and i do n't want competing scents otherwise i might have rated it even lower	15
0	i'm all about lip plumping glosses and this one sucked it has a really slippery constistancy and did not plump my lis at all i 'll stick with my too faced lip injection products	15
0	actually i would give the product 5 stars and the packaging a minus 2 citylips really does work plumping and hydrating it does required repeated applications but the packaging results in about 10 12 of the \( expensive \) material being completely unavailable ! worse if you try to wiggle the \( too short \) applicator in order to get the last 10 the container breaks at the neck \( actually one came already cracked in my case ! \) true they do offer some colors at 2 3 price but most effective is to apply clear and go outside the lipline and the clear almost never has gone on sale !	15
0	works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips wouldnt buy it again	15
0	i used two tubes in one month one for daytime wear and one for nighttime and when i was n't going out \( clear \) i like the product how it looks and smoothes out my lips but i just cannot afford to pay 60 a month on my lips ! if they lower the price by 10 12 i will buy it again but not until they do	15
0	i am such a huge fan of the philosophy grace line that i thought i would really love this too i find that it is much too light for me it does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice but it does n't last long at all i guess i 'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice i'm wearing it nobody has said anything so far the shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes wonderful lather but no smell to speak of i will stick with amazing grace baby grace and pure grace those are wonderful	15
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	15
0	at first it 's a beautiful floral scent then it dries to something that gives me a headache i cannot detect what smell it is but it 's not pleasant i cannot detect vanilla in this at all	15
0	i was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so i gave it a try i love it ! it 's surprising it changes on me when i first put it on it takes on a white floral scent when i first applied it i was surprised that it seemed like a floral but hours later i was smelling vanilla i was very surprised to realize it was me ! very interesting ! very cool ! lighter than the original poison it may become my spring summer choice	15
0	it does n't smell woody to me at all well maybe a fake pinesol type of smell it smells really artificial and almost chemical y i guess it 's not so bad and some people might like it but i did n't	15
0	i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it well it was good at first and then i got tired it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine i sometiems use it but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits \( that 's what i use it for \) i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long	15
0	this item does n't include everything that is mention in the details i would n't even pay a dollar for it don't purchase this item ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
0	i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly kinky hair it did n't do anything for my hair and i did n't like the smell \( but its not that big of a deal \) i returned it i do n't think its for coarse kinky curls but maybe for others textures lt for coarse 'naturals' try carol 's daughter 's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line	15
0	nanoparticles \? \? \? \? i was in the process of re ordering this item until i read the description apparently you 're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe thanks a lot lancome ! not on my face !	15
0	sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying something i have n't experienced with other removers in addition it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish on the plus side it 's fragrance free and reasonable in price	15
0	i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there 's just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it 's oil free it did n't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you 're looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf	15
0	as much as i love fat girl slim i thought i 'd try serious cellulite soap to go with it i was not impressed at all it has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap it was what i thought it would be at all the size of the bar was good the price is good but i am not pleased at all with the quality	15
0	the texture of this cleanser is waxy i could barely get it off my face and i broke out badly after using it i double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser and that i had n't mistakenly put some other product on my face it smells wonderful though i tried to think of alternate uses for the product but finally threw it away	15
0	i was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that i read on it boy where they wrong i used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all i have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list especially for how much it cost	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove it does not simply wash off it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink about half of them remain attached to your lashes and i 've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara everything else i 've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic but the best mascara out there hands down is from lancome	15
0	this clarifying lotion is too harsh i used it once and my skin is itchy dry and red i think i'm allergic to it basically the chemicals in these products are really harmful most of the time people do n't need these products all they do is clog up what nature has given us this lotion is horrible	15
0	i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you ca n't smell a thing yes the scent is great i love it but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me really really disapointed i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines they are quality and can last most of the day this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days	15
0	i like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister maybe i just have a defective one but i need to unscrew the top and dab it on	15
0	i love the smell of this perfume however it does n't stay on i have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem i was sold by sjp on this perfume when she appeared on oprah loved it when i went to the counter at the mall to check it out i have been using it for about 2 months now and it just does n't last about an hour after i put it on i \( or my husband \) ca n't smell it anymore trust me i learned to apply it liberally and it still does n't stay totally disappointed	15
0	my husband was revolted by the smell of this product i have bad sinuses so it did n't bother me as far as effectiveness goes there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction i used it everyday several times a day and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands at a cost of almost 20 for 8 5oz i got skunked	15
0	shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin my mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their benefiance line i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in their pureness line it is for oily problem skin i have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful light clean fragrance it had made my skin even oilier i thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case	15
0	i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line along with adoring the amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent boy was i wrong ! ! if you love amazing grace this smells nothing like it it smells like plastic flowers not appealing at all even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic if you want a fantastic exfoliator try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub those are devine ! i think i 'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on	15
0	this scrub did n't moisturize my skin at all and the salt stings ! it seems like it is more of a cleanser than anything and the scent is boring	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
0	this is one of the cutest shower caps i 've owned but it did n't keep my hair dry the cap kept sliding up my head sephora 's shower cap also did the same thing but at least it only cost 5 so far i 've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay in a hotel	15
0	i sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent after shopping a bit i went back and decided to buy it it 's nice and light but after wearing it for the first time i realized it 's too light i could n't even smell it when i held my wrist to my nose the second time i decided to apply more i must 've used 6 7 sprays and still only a lingering aroma for the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent i would n't recommend it	15
0	i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips it just wont glide you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em clinique liners are the worst one in the market	15
0	i read the label and it is not a rare tropical oil at all but plain old american palm oil ! false advertising really bothers me it did condition my hair well but i agree that the fragrances \( which are added to it by the way \) make the odor very strong and unpleasant the price is also very high i will not order this again	15
0	i have very dry frizzy hair this treatment left my hair softer now my hair is a big soft frizz ball it added too much body i like this better for use as a grooming gloss	15
0	this is a hit or miss product i ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating \( burnt coffee caramel cigarettes \) the product did work for a while my extremely dry curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working i would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut jojoba almond avocado before shampooing or after i adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier if you do want to try the product ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them	15
0	this item smells like lemon pine sol it is not what you think you are paying for its not worth the money	15
0	as a rule i like the seche products this polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment i wasted my money on this one	15
0	i have been using frederic fekkai 's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so i thought i would try the luscious curls it was very thick which may be a good thing since there is so little of it but does n't spread through hair very well it left my hair a little crunchy and the crunchiness did n't go away for a few hours when it did dry i felt that my curls just kind of hung there without much body or shine i have used loreal 's professional line prior to this and i will definitely go back to it it 's cheaper better quality and twice the size of luscious curls	15
0	my hair was still frizzy after using this product	15
0	this product was a waste of good money it does n't even work to control frizz as promised the curls are limp and after about an hour or so there is a lot of frizz i would not buy this product again	15
0	i 've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles and yes it does burn ! the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere i 've had dark under eye circles all my life i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money i will not be wasting my money on this product again	15
0	does n't really change appearance of eye area i'm 37 and am starting to get some lines puffiness and circles but used product 3weeks and was n't impressed	15
0	i 've been using this product for about two weeks now and i have n't seen the slightest change in the dark circles under my eyes i do n't know how long you have to use it before you see a difference but i do n't think it 's going to show any change in the dark circles personally i think i wasted my money i do n't think theres anything on the market that can help dark circles under the eyes lind	15
0	i have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin leaving burn marks for weeks ! finally i went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal please check with your doctor first before trying this	15
0	not goo	15
0	this does n't work first time i tried it it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more so i tried it again and again and again i 've given up on it it totally does n't work	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months while i thought it moisturized fine i did not notice any change in my lines tone texture for the money i 'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti aging products they work better have a nicer texture and smell much better	15
0	i used this product for a couple of months with no visible result in addition it 's quite greasy and since it 's not made to be used on the face we can understand that but that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses	15
0	but i wo n't buy this again it smells good and dipping it into one of the bare escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat but the product does n't really moisturize my lips and i have n't found a color i like on my lips once i dip this into a bare escentuals powder i wo n't be buying this again i will probably just try a lip gloss next time	15
0	the texture of this product is fine but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore therefore overpriced now if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag but it does n't smell that great it smells rather like over cooked coffee beans the bare escentuals soy mocha spf 15 has a much nicer smell and texture if you 're wanting a bare escentuals product	15
0	my mom had bought their darkest shade and after applying it it was obvious that she was wearing reddish dark brown eyebrow pencil it did n't blend in at all it stood out against her black eyebrow hairs so i bought her an eyebrow pencil from yves saint laurent in 5 that one is perfect not too black and not too brown	15
0	i am a big philosophy fan i have bought the best facial cleanser ever from them \( purity \) i have two other fragrances that i bought scent unsmelled from them amazing grace is lovely and pure grace is tremendous get them do n't buy falling in love it 's yucky	15
0	i'm very disappointed with the results i am fairly young 31 i have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear it really did n't do anything to my skin plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell i do not recommend this	15
0	i have been using this product for about a month and all it 's done is given me puffy eyes there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles i 've used botox before and believe me botox works this product does n't so obviously it 's not better than botox i bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is	15
0	i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months while i thought it moisturized fine i did not notice any change in my lines tone texture for the money i 'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti aging products they work better have a nicer texture and smell much better as for better than botox buyer beware when you hear this line	15
0	one i do n't think this is better than botox botox works instantly and more dramatically but it 's more expensive however when you think about how much you 're spending on this strivectin applying it every day for the rest of your life you could get botox \( yes you need to get more botox every several months but the costs are about the same \) not only that but botox simply works better however if you just ca n't afford botox then i would buy rulinea fx which is the exact same ingredients as strivectin but half the price it 's available on hsn co	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	this did not help my skin at all i would not reccomend it to anyone ! save your money !	15
0	this product did nothing for my t zone i was still very shiney and oily by mid day i recommend benefit 's dr feelgood i gave this product two stars because though it did n't control oil for me it did n't feel heavy or clog my pores	15
0	this product costs 10 times more then a regular gel but it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face it did not help at all no doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the marketing department because it fooled me just like it fooled everyone 18 for a gel ! it must be more effective i 'll give it a try there is a sucker born every day jose' \( sucker	15
0	i have fairly sensative skin and can use most dior products but this product made my skin peel off of my face be very careful and test this first on your hand	15
0	i love coconuts and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts instead my hair smells like burnt coconuts or even burnt newspaper the conditioning qualities of the product are n't good enough \( and it certainly is n't cheap enough \) to make me purchase this again at least not until i develop a hankering for smokey smelling hair	15
0	it smells great like coconut i have long curly hair and it made my hair dry and brittle i 've noticed this with all of the lush conditioners i 've tried so i would not recommend it for naturally curly hair 2 stars for the great smell	15
0	this is the only lush product thus far that i 've absolutely hated the smell of this is downright revolting and it does n't do anything for my hair try retread \( my favourite lush conditioner \) veganese or even american cream over this one	15
0	so i bought this item and i hated it i wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair ! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me	15
0	i found this product did absolutely nothing for me granted i do n't have huge wrinkles but the few i do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse ! i wish i had asked around from friends cause if i had i would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money i'm wondering a couple of things what all the fuss is about with strivectin \? is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some do n't \? and is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that really works \? \( if it works i do n't mind spending the money	15
0	i usually enjoy products by philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family xolo with amigo trust me this stuff stinks ! if a margarita is what you are craving then stop in at the local don pablo 's at lunchtime not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin but as the bottle warns using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract not good i will say one good thing about this product it made the drains in my home smell lime fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them	15
0	i quickly realized while in the shower that i do n't want to smell like a margarita all day it does lather well and i do n't find the smell to overpowering but it 's not that special warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair	15
0	i ca n't say enough about philosohpy but i read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink so i purchased the margarita instead i hate to say it but it is probabloy about the same for this product it smells so much like kool aid that i ca n't use it the smell is way to sweet i am a big margarita fan but this smells nothing like it ! just a caution	15
0	poor quality construction the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use plus it was much rougher than something like loofah you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that	15
0	did n't like this product all of the actual scrub \( salt \) is at the top and minimal felt like i would 've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub it did smell nice and i like the packaging	15
0	i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th ! ! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense \( 5 \) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible im very mad at lush com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap pissedoff	15
0	i was soooo excited to get this in the mail i have very oily skin the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed the shipping is insanely high i will stick to mac skincare from now on	15
0	i enjoyed using this product because i liked the tingling from the mint not necessarily a good thing actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face the kaolin and bentonite are drying agents peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin if you separate out the so called natural ingredients you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses and if it does n't come straight out of the ground it ai n't natural anymore ! i give it a 2 because i was a sucker for the tingling not because i saw any improvement in my skin 's texture look or feel	15
0	well i dint like the smell at all i see nothing lovely about this perfum if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have j lo 's live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present or for urself its not really worth ur money !	15
0	and it 's called narcisso rodriguez buy the nr you 'll like it a whole lot more	15
0	i have oily blemish prone skin and i was told by my mother who used to work for the clinique estee lauder family to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non cosmogenic this product irritated my skin so much that i just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness the only reason why i used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working if it was working it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than i ever had all at once not worth your money	15
0	i do n't know why i keep giving clinique a chance i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away try clean clear for oily skin it 's better and cheaper	15
0	overpriced for a mediocre soap with a terrible perfume	15
0	i love clinique products in general but i do n't like the soap in the liquid form it has a strong chemical smell to it and i find myself holding my breath while washing my face i much prefer the bar soap and would n't buy the liquid again for all that it seemed much more convenient no complaints on cleaning ability	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	this product might be better on oily skin with no make up the point of it was lost on me it may create a barrier between treatment products moisturizer and make up but it did nothing to perfect my skin in fact when i touched my face i could feel make up pilling and rolling off it has a dry heavy feeling to it do n't use too much and be careful about dry patches i thought it would make a better canvas of my skin i now use laura mercier 's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow i did n't like the formulation of philosophy 's product at all	15
0	i really wanted to like this i had heard so much about it and everyone seems to love it it smells like sunless tanning lotion on me i hate that smell does it smell like that to anyone else \? oh well i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it	15
0	i wanted it to smell good but it just smells so cheap to me i tried it several times but it is not amazing i would not recommend this perfume	15
0	i normally like warm sensual type perfumes but i wanted to try something different for a change i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey well i have to disagree i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all to me it has a very sharp high toned scent which is almost acrid i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on so i tried just a little spritz still very strong and sharp and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets i will definitely not be ordering this again	15
0	i know this is philosophy 's big seller but i hate the way it smells it reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous my husband hated it too as did my son i like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet that is about as close as it gets if you want a good philosophy scent go with falling in love pure grace or philosophy the scent all of them are better than amazing grace i do n't care to smell like a perfumy granny thank you i 'll stick with my falling in love	15
0	i had trouble rinsing this stuff out it weighed my hair down and my hair is dry also my son came up to me and said why does your hair smell so funny \? i think it 's too conditioning for my hair and too smelly	15
0	one of my boys bought this item for me and well its ok for the price its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well and the scent is extremly light which i dont like now if they were to make it stronger this would be a 5 star product	15
0	i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh clean scent i was very disapointed when i used it as it reminded me of jean nate which to me is an old lady smell it was more musky than clean smelling i could n't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil that is the only way i can describe it	15
0	i am dissatisfied with lush 's claims that many of its products like this one are natural i encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in lush 's products i have yet to see a lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety there are numerous other brands of truly all natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently	15
0	its cute but it blocks barely any light lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable	15
0	i 've had this dryer for almost a year now and like the styists who also own it i find it temperamental it does a great job while it 's working but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months if you turn the dryer off you 'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on now it turns off while i'm in the middle of doing my hair the stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other \( s \) cool off as i said when they work they 're terrific i'm going to replace mine with another brand	15
0	it could cover the tattoo but after while it fails not fully invisible	15
0	if you order this kit make sure you have time to practice with it ! it takes several practice applications to get the shade just right while it does cover completely it is not flawless you can tell that you 've covered something up on your skin if it 's not a big deal you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit	15
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	15
0	this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses this scent does n't linger and is too subtle not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil i do n't recommend this unless you are 16 and under i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it	15
0	did not care for this one really it is better as a body wash	15
0	i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it 's definitely not for me in any way it 's very drying on my skin even though it 's thick and creamy the label says it 's award winning but does n't state what award it 's received \( if any ! \) i fail to see what might warrant it being award winning the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy also it 's absurdly priced given the quality i 've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed	15
0	i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product i opened this bottle expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected ! when i read that it smelled the nesquick i thought i 'd like it anyway because i love strawberry nesquick but this stuff smells like well i ca n't describe it all i know is i wish i had n't paid 16 for it live and learn i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel smells better off topic why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3 in 1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel \? would n't they smell just the same	15
0	after reading reviews of the other philosophy items i was hoping this would smell more like a strawberry milkshake than fake strawberry quick	15
0	i bought this hoping i would look good and get my face cleaned no lie this soap makes you look uglier than you really are so unless you wanna smell a little weird and not look your best dont buy this soap ! im serious !	15
0	this soap washed really well but after i rinsed it off it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it it also made my skin feel stipped i did not really like this soap and instead recommend basis facial products instead	15
0	i knew i was taking a chance buying a cheap eye cream and sure enough i was right it did nothing ! well yo get what you pay for ! i was going to try the ocuderm or ddf products and i guess i will do that now costs more but the results i hear are great i should of known better	15
0	you gotta love this woman 's moxy when the high life of being robert prayer requests in the dumpster tilton 's wife evaporated she picked herself right back up and developed a riff of her own selling worthless cosmetics always plenty of suckers to be found	15
0	i will keep this review short the product does not work period i have been using the product morning and evening since the begining of february and have not seen a single change i just bought some olay eye cream a week ago and can already see an improvement	15
0	some of the lush products are wonderful this is n't one of the	15
0	i bought this make up at neiman marcus excited to try it and i was horribly disappointed it was hard to apply \( i accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air \) and what i did manage to get on my face it did not cover much for the price they wanted this is unexcusable i promptly returned my airflash and got my money back i do not recommend this product	15
0	i have this gloss in carney while i like the color the gloss is very gooey and gloppy and it does n't stay on long at all i would not buy it again	15
0	i have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit i use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks nothing changed i figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so i continued to use this product \( use the entire jar just to give it plenty of time \) still not difference could be seen for me it was a waste of money	15
0	this item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off	15
0	i received this free from sephora as a birthday present because i signed up as a beauty insider i gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it but there 's no reason this product should cost 16 i'm betting the ingredients packaging shipping costs do n't total more than 3 i would n't buy it	15
0	i like the philosophy line but the vanilla birthday cake body wash does n't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas the product is great though	15
0	i was n't really thrilled with this product it smells great but as soon as the shower is over the thrill is gone	15
0	i read many good reviews for this product on this site and elsewhere so i eagerly bought it it came in a quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind of awful as a skin softner it worked well but i threw it out after using it only a few times because of the way it smelled	15
0	i bought this and shortly after i started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling i did n't know what was going on and i stopped using it and it immediately went away as soon as i started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back i am a person who does n't break out very often and i can tolerate many products i now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it has n't faded yet i tried to take it back to nordstrom and they would n't exchange it this product sucks and as it was the only one i was using i know thats what caused the swelling	15
0	my fiance' left this bottle of prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it it was empty ! ! ! seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer \( pump sprayer \) and then it all leaked out and down the bottle glueing itself to the jewelry box now we have an empty bottle of prada and a ruined finish on the top of the jewelry box i have sent sephora an email explaining what had happened but have not heard back from them beware of where you keep this bottle ! ! !	15
0	this stuff is the worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered the perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed it took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness i wish i could give it a negative rating i am glad all i used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink	15
0	might be a great product i ca n't be sure because uh hello \? mine did n't come with any instructions whatsover i opened it up and i was like ah hello \? where are the instructions \? but the tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze did not answer my questions if anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions i would greatly appreciate it until then my tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze is just gonna sit there not being used like my box of floss a bag of onions and my heart	15
0	if philosophy makes it for my skin i think i own it i love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when i bought the set the micro peel is awesome but these pads were disappointing they dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit i have seen no difference since i discontinued using this product seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths	15
0	my experience i heard such great things about prevage restores youthful skin reverses damage etc i could n't wait until it was available finally i was able to buy it nice packaging great dispenser of just the right amount after two months i found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1 10 the price eucerin for instance kinerase did nothing for me either so it may just be me just fyi fair sensitive dry skin middle aged	15
0	i am asian and i have very thick and coarse hair i bought this product due to all the rave but it did nothing for me and it does n't even smell nice after trying numerous products and flat irons i had thermal reconditioning done my hair has never been smoother silkier and so easily manageable no product or styling necessary just wash and go	15
0	the front material is cheap feeling and grainy also there is a large plastic gold colored cris notti button adorning the front that does not appear in the online picture otherwise it is functionally useful and of good quality	15
0	i use the philosophy 3 in 1 with conditioner it works great and keeps my hair luscious the one time i accidentally bought a 3 in 1 that did n't have conditioner in it my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends after only three applications i had to throw the bottle out i lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair i do n't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality but they do this is one of their better scents however i would recommend using this as a body wash only	15
0	i ordered this product for my wife 3 weeks before christmas with several other philosophy items they shipped this was backordered i 've sent three messages to them and have not heard a sinlge response terrible aparently customer services is not a philosophy this company subscribes to i have gone ahead and filed a formal complaint through amazon you are probably better off buying their products at a brick and mortar store their online presence is unreliable at best	15
0	i love the scent of this bathbomb but the clean up is annoying noone wants to take a nice bath and then have to get out the tub cleaner afterwards but now i can finally use this bomb again someone advised my to put the bomb in an old nylon to catch the petals this worked fine but took a little away from the whole bath expeirence to have to watch an old nylon float around meif you love the scent then its worth it if its only so so to you move on because this ones a mes	15

0	i was using this thing religiously from my 5th month with coco butter as well i still got stretch marks ba	15
0	i still got the marks iwish it had of helped i used it for a while after giving birth but it did n't help	15
0	i love the cinnamon buns shower gel so i thought i would try the lip gloss for one thing it smells tastes nothing like cinnamon buns i do n't know what the flavor is but i do n't like it maybe they have added almond or something secondly it 's way too sticky my hair kept getting stuck to my lips it reminds me of vaseline since i got this product in a kit i cannot return it but i will not be using it again	15
0	this did nothing for my lashes which are blonde but long so it does n't take all that much it somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too i discovered diorshow after this and it 's phenominal ! but if you want a very good mascara and do n't want to spend the money i recommend max factor 2000 calorie	15
0	i tried this mascara expecting great things but was very disappointed the mascara seemed dry and it took too long to apply enough so that it even looked like i had lashes \( my natural lashes are almost clear \) back to the drawing board of looking for the holy grail of mascara	15
0	i bought this mascara based on a review i read on amazon maybe it 's just me but i still find that my lashes clump or stick together with this product it might be the navy color i do n't think its worth the extra cost i do just as well with drugstore mascara	15
0	i have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now just as many of the reviewers had been i purchased this mascara based on the reviews and i am more than disappointed in the mascara i would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it the mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash i do not mind paying 25 00 for a tube of mascara if it doe 's the job this one doe 's not i had better luck with max factor clinque etc	15
0	for me it barely looked like i had mascara on at all i have blonde eyelashes so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop and this did n't really i ended up giving it to my mom thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it and she did n't like it either it ended up in the garbage i 've loved dior show mascara and of course great lash i 'd recommend those over this especially for the money	15
0	this perfume is very mediocre one of my friends loved it and on the spur of the moment i decided to give it a try what a waste ! its not unpleasant but so unremarkable that 10 seconds after spraying you forget what it smells like would n't be buying it again	15
0	this product does absolutely nothing it made my face look even more queasy and dry at the same time save your money	15
0	the eyeshadow is n't bad nice color but the packaging was a disappointment the brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you ca n't get very much onto the brush there is no way to open the casing either so its pretty useless i found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also	15
0	very clumpy ! i would never purchase this again it looked like i had one big eyelash they were all clumped together worse one i have ever used	15
0	i thought this was tea holy was i in for a surprise \? did anyone else think this was tea \? it i couldn't get that taste out of my mouth for about four weeks	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i had never tried anything from philosophy and wanted to try the 3 in 1 stuff and i thought the lavendar pound cake would smell really good i was actually really disappointed it sucks as a shampoo and body wash too i ordered the blueberry pie too and i haven't even used it its just sitting in my closet for the price you get a lot and lasts long but i wasn't impressed	15
0	i usually love the philosophy brand bath and shower gels but this was a major disappointment did n't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating there are other gels that are great but avoid this one ! phew ! !	15
0	it does n't work for what we intended it for blackhead removal my teen son was really hoping this would help him and it did n't not only that but the safety cap for the lance end does n't stay on	15
0	the company shipping was fine no beefs there the product itself i find to be rather damaging to the skin in order to extract you have to press down extremly hard \( if you can even locate what your attempting to extract w that darn pin hole at the end \) i ca n't imagine this would n't leave scars i would n't reccomend this product i just put it in the drawer never to be used again	15
0	so i 've owned a tweezerman extractor before and i am now questioning why i didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar this extractor is no help what so ever the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that i would press the right pore its just too small to even target the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful you could damage your skin i would recommend not buying this extractor i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman	15
0	the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because i love benefit that being said this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper it 's so faint that you can hardly smell it but when you do it 's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better if you are looking for a young fun perfume stay away from this one it smells old and drab like your grandmother 's china cabinet or an antique store but if you like that	15
0	maybe i expect too much however even my lowest expectation wasnt met just go ask a dermatologist to help dont waste your money	15
0	i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make up sales representative at nordstrom 's i was less than pleased with the product i used the entire container and saw no benefit ! !	15
0	why is this product advertised here for 100 more than the cost of purchasing it directly from the la mer website	15
0	listen up ! ! ! l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1 7 ounce has the same moisturizing results for a fraction of the cost ! ! ! \)	15
0	over 1 000 for moisturizing cream \? as the saying goes a fool and their money are soon parted	15
0	a complete waste of money i still have all my stretch mark	15
0	i did n't care for it it smelled good but that 's the only good thing i can say it neither helped or harmed my hair i do n't think i would buy it again	15
0	yikes i was so surprised at the size of the bottle i had no idea it would be that small for the price the scent is nice but i would not reorder	15
0	i bought this with a kit this stuff was just not worth it to me but unlike the others i cannot stand the smell it is very strong and gave me a headache so i could not really leave it on that long my scalp did feel conditioned though but if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you	15
0	what 's the point of this mascara when half the container does n't do what it 's supposed to do \? the black mascara is not good quality it comes off very quickly part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara and the silver stuff the only reason someone would seek out this product is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15

0	beware ! it is a fake not a real genuine mac lipstick do not buy the amplified creme from this seller he has only fakes amplified cremes i got a few	15
0	i work in the cosmetics industry beware this is a copy not a real mac lipstick ! not even close to the formula or color of moxie	15
0	not what i expected ! this shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair it has no conditioning whatsoever i used the jungle conditioner after the shampoo it is equally hopeless ! it is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of india ! a waste of money a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype	15
0	it is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face worse it does absolutely nothing i have been applying a significant amount morning and night for 6 weeks allowing it to soak in and dry it does nothing	15
0	i have been using the product faithfully for several weeks usually twice daily and have not seen any difference in facial brightening i would not repurchase this product	15
0	i 've had excellent luck with tweezerman products in the past but the quality of this blackhead remover was second rate the item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw in attachments neither attachments really work the threading of both seems to be flawed and to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face no thanks ! my e mailed request for re threading or replacement to tweezerman went unanswered this purchase was an expensive mistake	15
0	i received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of my boys the sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length re lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn the scent does n't remind me of vanilla grapefruit more like plain burning sticks which wo n't cost you 13 votivo does candles well but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired not worth the money	15
0	i ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website however i have n't wanted to use this product much due to it 's odor very medicinal chemical smelling makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face ! i used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and did n't notice any difference in my skin i would n't recommend this product unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it	15
0	i received my order and was very dissapointed the skin tones online are deceiving i ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy does n't blend well with skin suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone	15
0	i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids i was really bummed out try the cinnamon buns it is so much better	15
0	okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep \? it lasts until the next afternoon it 's not even just a weak scent that 's left on you it 's like as if you 've been spraying it constantly but here 's the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it 's great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this is n't the product for you	15
0	there is absolutely nothing special about this leave in conditioner besides the fact that it smells really good however i did n't see any changes in my daughter 's hair after using this conditioner none it is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly otherwise it will run down your face and neck \( wish it came with a spray pump instead \) i was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well known and has a lot of star celebrity power behind it however i found this conditioner to be all hype	15
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
0	ok so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i 've tried and felt the need to write a review on i have to say this product is far below expectations i sprayed in on and the only thing you smell is the alcohol there seems to be no other notes to it even after you let it settle all you can pick up is alcohol definitely not recommending this product	15
0	i bought this for travel gym bag use when it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed the frangrace was very masculine smelling i guess this is the yerba mate aroma which is very earthy smelling	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i bought this stuff because i heard it helped with razor burn my husband likes me to shave a bit more often than i liked well too bad for him ! ! the pain from putting this stuff on was way worse than any sort of razor burn ! no thanks !	15
0	i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning tend skin helps for that ! just take a strong whiff and you 'll be alert and ready for your day !	15
0	i used to use tend skin it works ok but there are better things out there now tend skin is an outdated product like the sytptic pencil tend skin stings smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill i recently switched to min solution2 like it much better than tend skin min solution2 has a roller application \( no waste \) organic spearmint \( fresh smell \) and does n't burn like tend skin	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
0	i love these products however this particular candle does not have the same intense scent as previous candles i 've purchase	15
0	i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like lemon pledge it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room	15
0	this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over it was terribly strong and just not quite what i wanted the company did promptly give me a refund though i suggest you try out demeter fragrances they are more natural smelling	15
0	this product is no better than any regular washcloth and or headband to hold your hair back save your money	15
0	i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line any benefits i thought i was getting from lush out the window their products seemed all the sudden unimpressive and i really like that melt is denver based ! try them out and see what you think for yourself \( if you are n't here in colorado i know they have online products too \) and make your own choice i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch !	15
0	when i got this candle i was very excited but when i lit it it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart when i put it out the fart smell went away	15
0	i bought this for my wife for the holidays it was a bit expensive for a candle but i believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly however in our case after about an hour the candle went out the wick burned too quickly becoming too small and now the candle wo n't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax the return shipping will cost a lot so we will just toss it out waste of money do n't buy one	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
0	i got very irresistible by givenchy perfume as a gift for christmas as first smell i loved it then i spritzed it and yikes ! that was 2 months ago and i still have the scent on me it 's too flowery it 's not a clean fresh scent more of a i sprayed a little too much potpouri in here scent not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either ! !	15
0	if you 're really looking forward to brightening your blonde go to the salon and ask for a non ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color the expense of this product is not justified by the results and while lush likes to toot its horn about being natural that designation could apply to arsenic it 's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives the parabens	15
0	i'm black and for my hair type 4b i try to use natural products on my hair and it did n't have those no no chemicals and oils that are known to be damaging to black hair well this product did not as it advertised which was to stay put i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb coils or finger coil in place i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good sad thing is that i ca n't get my money back i use it as a hair grease for my scalp i hope i 've been helpful	15
0	this brush was not as firm as expected i expected greater quality from the sephora brand however the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to finer brushes so in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more	15
0	it stings burns and irritated my skin didnt prevent any breakouts i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most 0 stars if i could need i say more	15
0	i ordered the saturday morning special gift set and tried the tui herbal shampoo right away as with everyone else no lather and lots of tangles after the second wash i decided to use my pantene relaxed and natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair this stuff is a rip off on the plus side it works fabulously on my children 's hair they are bi racial and have naturally curly hair i do n't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair it just does n't work	15
0	this shampoo is just awful it 's greasy and it 's made up of a 90 10 ratio 90 being oil and 10 being soap smells great but leaves your hairl slimy and gross	15
0	maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products however this shampoo did not work for me like the previous reviewer said it was watery and did not lather at all it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard i followed up with a hair smoothie but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair i do not recommend this at all	15
0	this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake it is watery and does not lather my hair felt like it had n't been washed for days and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting 10 00	15
0	all i can say is do not buy this i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time it smells horrible it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it i had to wash my hair \( with a different product of course \) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again what a complete rip off ! ! !	15
0	i have glorious white hair and i thought this would be good for it but it seems to dry my hair too much and frankly i do n't see that it 's any better than the two dollar bottle of suave that 's out there i 've also used lush 's big shampoo and soak 'n' float shampoo bars and i like them much better	15
0	i have to agree with another reviewer this product is not worth the price tag it claims to have a vanilla scent and it does but it is barely noticible do n't buy this product based on how it smells as a moisturizer you can do much better for 23 00	15
0	the shipping was very slow and the product really is n't worth 23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer	15
0	like said in an earlier review after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you ca n't see a thing in it in the shower i run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes then you ca n't clear it with any method total waste not worth a dollar	15
0	i love laura mercier 's skin products but her makeup line has these dark cherry burnt orange rasberry colors that just do n't work for fair skin or blonde hair \( which i have \) i wish her colors were better there was only 1 eye color i could wear in this kit and the 3 glow stick things were confusing because they were n't sticks	15
0	as rosey as this oils smells it just is n't as good as the real thing being a fragrance oil it has no medicinal properties i certainly would n't use it on my skin or in a bath ! thanks but no thanks you definitely get what you pay for	15
0	this product was such a waste the little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow drying the hair i will not repurchase it	15
0	i first bought inis cologne in ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time i will go to great lengths to find the cologne i am very glad it is now being offered by amazon	15
0	when i first spray inis energy of the sea cologne spray i could not smell any thing ! then i spray more and more 'till i found out how it smells ! it has nice scent okay i 'll tell you how i found it it is not bad ! but despite that it does n't last for more than half an hour and then it hardly can be smelled you may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour this is what disappointed me the most ! i am telling you my taste here that is n't necessarily yours	15
0	i opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype this is the worst smelling perfume ever when i put it on it smelled like burnt clothing like an iron had just done it 's worst on cotton it was so awful i put it straight in the bin	15
0	the description represents a 2 ounce solid fragrance as a lover of all things philosophy i was very disappointed to get something half the size i expected which was 13 ounces ! my 2 stars are only because the fragrance is divine as are they all !	15
0	i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap but sadly that 's not what happened the smell is a very strong herbal like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish not very appealing ! there is some complexity to the scent but it 's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through on the plus side the color is beautiful \( a rich dark purple \) and the lather is equally lovely to look at if you like true herbal scents then you should give this a try it just was n't for me	15
0	love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product ! well this one used to have about 3 five star ratings i added my two cents this product did nothing for me whatsoever so some people love it i do n't get it and it 's pretty much the opposite of an anti oxidant so that does n't make sense i pointed this out in my review wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough \? also it 's listed at 45 on amazon as well from the same supplier huh	15
0	i bought this from sephora it left my hair a greasy mess and i have dry coarse hair it was very greasy and did n't rinse out well at all	15
0	i can truly say that this products does n't work i have silky wavy fine hair and i am a hair food junkie so i used a lot of things but this do n't work usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard matted and tangled carol daughter 's products may work for some but it has n't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures	15
0	happy has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins it is like cheap colognes	15
0	i ordered the gift set and it came as advertised very cute package unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast \( that i could find \) so i could not test it it is far too strong a scent even the lotion the candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes my advice find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing	15
0	i should have known better people were telling me to use dermaaction from www topicalbeauty com but i wasted my money on hylexin instead saw no results dermaaction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now next time i 'll listen	15
0	i really wanted this to work i have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else but i 've been using this twice a day for two months and i have n't noticed any improvement at all not even a little in fact my eyes might actually look worse it has not faded the dark circles nor has it improved the bags	15
0	i fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money save your money trust me ! i used this product 2 3 times a day until the entire tube was gone \( took several months \) and saw no change whatsoever ! i have serious dark circles which is what it claims to help i am very disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again ! what a bunch of crap btw look at all the reviews this product is listed in several places here ! !	15
0	after i ordered this product one of my co workers told me about the reviews on amazon i checked it out and i was really surprised ! the reviews are poor the worst part though is that the product is listed three times ! ! what 's the deal \? \? a product gets a bad review so they re list it more bad reviews and they re list it again ! see for yourself do a general search for hylexin and you will see several listings of the same product trying to out run bad reviews \? \? \? \? i now think less of the product and amazon shame on you both	15
0	this stuff is very expensive and i 've diligently used it as the directions state i havent seen growth i am actually losing more eyelashes ! ! i was going to buy the mascara if i grew the eyelashes but it does n't seem to be working sigh	15
0	the click stick applicator is ridiculous you have no control over the shadow when you click it nothing comes out you have to twist about ten times and then suddenly a huge blob enough for eighteen applications comes busting out the only way i 've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob i purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way as far as the actual shadow it 's fine nothing spectacular you could get the same product from wet'n wild for a buck	15

0	i paid 100 00 for a tube of hylexin because i have serious dark circles unfortunately i fell for the hype because i would have tried anything that says significantly reduces dark circles ! i followed the directions and waited nothing ! i teach business ehtics at a university part of the course involves ethics in advertising i use the hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording the packaging etc please take my word for it and save yourself some money	15

0	okay but does not keep cool for long i do like the massage effect from the beads	15
0	until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave ins it made my dry curly hair soft shiny and smelling great ! but lately something has changed the once thick silky liquid has turned thin and watery with a distinctly alcohol like smell it 's so disappointing this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book do n't bother with it anymore unless the original formula comes back	15
0	in all honesty i 'd rate the fragrance itself as 5 stars however the scent does not last for love nor money which is why i give it a mere 1 star you 'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and consequently before you know it you 've depleted your perfume ! talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and if they 're honest they will tell you exactly what i 've written here because i adore the scent i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect	15
0	ive had this product for the past 2 weeks and it does not do what it claims to do i still have to reapply makeup and it still smudges of	15
0	i think this product would be great but was n't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy 's website does't give you one tiny bit of information the very last step the very last sentence says that you should n't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout the reason i bought this was to clear up my face so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin	15
0	this did n't do anything for me is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect \? i am returning it i'm really surprised others had such great results because i tried it twice and left it on for double the time and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream it does have more than baking soda and h2o2 also contains catalase some stearic acid and some vitamin c of course your skin already has its own catalase	15
0	this is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda which would cost the average person about 3 dollars	15
0	i 've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much but when i got around to actually smell it i was so dissapointed i can only smell an old lady perfume a bug spray i do n't know something so strong and not strong in the right way my favourites are dior j'adore red delicious intuition \( estee lauder \) try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful	15
0	small thin fragile not worth the five dollars find a better product from another company	15
0	i got my bottle of curve today and tried it out my girlfriend said i smelled like dust oops ! too bad they do n't have scratch and sniff on the computer	15
0	the product has made my skin much worse than when i started i am so sorry i even kept at it ! ! \( how can i reverse all the damage now that murad has given me	15
0	this dryed my skin out really bad and it did n't even work dont use this	15
0	this product should be listed only for people with really oily skin it dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red flaky and it hurt ! i also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying this is actually harsher than proactive unless your skin covered in oil it probably wont be able to handle it good luck getting your refund i'm still waiting for mine i also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them	15
0	i really wanted to like this one but just could n't get past the smell it was really over powering lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this is n't one of them i did n't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely it was just too strongly scented for my liking	15
0	i generally love lush soaps but do not recommend this one demon in the dark has a great name but it does n't smell very good \( a sort of faint slightly minty scent \) it also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off but must be removed for the soap to work properly i would try red rooster or karma soap instead	15
0	i'm in my 30 's light skin everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try did n't work for me after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy it 's not what they say it is i 've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body but the skin care products are a scam go for neutrogena or clinique good luc	15
0	ick i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that i used to love by loreal smell fake grade school grape aid smell grossed me out feel i like lip gloss that feels glossy this stuff did not shine enough or last long enough color the color was to mild for me i was very disappointed i felt like i had wasted money and time i still recommend loreal lip juice though i believe it 's the same company and lip juice is glossy shiny long lasting and way more cost effective	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt update trufitt and hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems they sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as massey it is good the standard is still substandard	15
0	i thought the product arrived in a timely manner the instructions were clear but it 's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time not a bad product for the price	15
0	i received this as a christmas gift and loved the smell of it after my second time using it i broke out in a terrible itchy rash there is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin the smell is great but is gone after you get out of the shower	15
0	i have worked with two women who have worn this perfume and frankly i ca n't stand the smell of it it does n't even smell like perfume it is like some bizarre animal musk there are no floral notes and no woodsy notes either nothing clean or fresh or pleasant i wish this perfume did n't exist i hate it	15
0	i had such high hopes for this product i thought it was going to be the perfect scent for me as it turns out that could n't be futher from the truth it smells like cheap old lady perfume yuck to top it all off they raised the price of it by 5 dollars ! ! talk about inflation ouch !	15
0	when i think of an almond cookie i think of something sweet especially given the description of this product the smell of almond is so overpowering its all i can smell i did n't catch vanilla or sandalwood i 've already returned my products	15
0	i ordered this item all of your information indicated that it was in stock the company shipped another product instead the mirror i wanted was out of stock i never received any information so i ended up paying more from another vendor and still did n't have the mirror for christmas i am so disappointed with amazon and bebeautiful	15
0	i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer i used just a little bit and it was really greasy i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum it works much better	15
0	i would n't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself after using this so called instant detangler my hair was more tangled then ever in my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads enlarged pores using this extractor is equal to using one 's fingers to squeeze out imperfections which may produce very temporary results but is ultimately fruitless those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep cleaning instead which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation	15

0	i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i'm using aquamarina instead and love it though you ca n't get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i'm sure this wo n't happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead	15
0	disappointingly this tape did not perform as well as hoped it was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place using a one inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping the tape and straps eventually started rolling and it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to newton 's law of gravity ! so not only did fashion faux pas continue to occur the tape caused a rash skin irritation with each use	15
0	if you have some respect for your nose please do n't buy these wipes ! ! ! i bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house ! ! ! and i would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby	15
0	these wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth they are about the same softness as the kirkland brand but cost a lot more and wooohoooo they smell stronger than este lauder herself	15
0	at 23 i do n't have age wrinkles around my eyes but i have laugh lines that i want to soften this product has done nothing for my laugh lines i could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines this product did not	15
0	i was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines this product that i used for 4 months showed no signifigant results as well as any other product ive used by estee lauder dont waste your money on it i usually look at it like this if any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it this product is crap !	15
0	that 's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it i bought the whole set as i am a sandalwood fanatic i could n't have been more disappointed this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood a complete waste of money	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
0	although this worked well on some of my blackheads i felt it was very harsh to my skin i was worried that using it would create even more scars i would not buy this product again	15
0	used daily for 3 months minimal improvement in dark circles zero improvement in lines around eye area \( i am 35 years old \) i hope this is not the best product out there	15
0	i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving the product claims to reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps ingrown hairs and redness from shaving but despite it 's lofty promises and high price it does none of this in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol the directions tell you to apply it after shaving but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving it only made my problem worse i wish i could have rated this product zero stars because it is absolutely worthless	15
0	i used tend skin for a few years and it was the best one that i could find but a few weeks ago i saw a nother product on amazon called solution 2 and ordered it instead i was a little worried because i was getting good results with the bumps with tend skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps	15
0	for medium length hair it lasted about 4 uses smells way funky ca n't say i noticed anything different just did n't feel that it warrants the hype	15
0	i think i may have had a bad batch because when i read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled made me curious so i tried it and i hated it ! the smell of it turned my stomach it did soften my hair a bit but i do n't recommend using it again sorry lush	15
0	let me just say that i have thick dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage the smell was really good at first very coconuty but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent like playdoh and pepper so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars	15
0	i was really excited for this ! i hoped it would be a faster easier way to do make up and what not but its not it smears like crazy and the end is so sharp it hurts to apply but that does n't matter ! the end stops working after a use or two i suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes \( for the black is more navy then black \) you 'll be happy i 've always loved the mark products but this is a disappointment	15
0	this stuff has great shine but it dries my lips and it starts peeling and uber sticky	15
0	at first it smells very sharp and citrusy almost like men 's cologne then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal after 15 minutes you wo n't be able to smell it at all very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag you 'd be better off buying a bottle of herbal essence shower gel and getting identical results	15
0	i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair sensitive skin which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face hands etc it did not irritate her skin at all the problem the one and only problem is the fragrance if you can call it that it stinks so bad i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down i had to give her a bath it was so bad	15
0	the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all it gets a little cold but warms up in about 45 seconds i also noticed very little over all effects from using it	15
0	i ordered the fedora i am so dissapointed it came off within a few hours ! just peeled right off do not order this brand of fingernail polish it is the worst i have ever used	15
0	i have to write in caps because i am so irritated i have tried 5 different carol's hair products and none including this one has worked not only that the smells aren't all that great and they scream it's like people who wear bad perfume that's extremely strong but smells horrible they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	15
0	was n't anything special you can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that 's half the price	15
1	i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen up mist i have normal type hair that needs to be washed every other day and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day i have very sensitive skin too this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry and it feels awesome on my skin well done jonathan	15
1	if jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products the aquasana shower filter is an excellent product which i use whats it matter who 's name is on it it is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher	15
1	i love jonathan products and especially how it makes my hairfeel so soft and sexy looking keep up the good work jonathan	15
1	finish firm hold spray is absolutely perfect for my needs it has a firm hold yet is n't heavy or hard i do n't have a complicated hair style but my hair tends to go flat after just a few hours this product prevents that	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
1	it 's the best product i 've used to create volume and hold i did n't notice it after blow drying but while using the curling iron and styling my hair had a lot more volume and great hold i have straight fine limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style i truely noticed a big difference i plan to purchase the other volumizing products once they are in stock	15
1	i have tried just about every hair product on the market and this very much surpassed my expectations ! i was n't sure when i put it in my hair but as i was styling it i was amazed it created a lot of volume and my hair stayed shiny i am ready to try the rest of the product line	15
1	this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry i have long hair and i love using this product it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life fantastic	15
1	its pretty expensive for gel but i like it my hair does n't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day	15
1	its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire i like the sting and the shine of it it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it 's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong did i mention the great smell \? yum ! me and my boyfriend loved it	15
1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
1	t3 is worth every penny it is very easy to handle my hair is soft and shiny no more frizz it cut straightening time to half no hair pulling and it is lightweight plus 2 years of warranty hellooo ! ! ! bye bye chi	15
1	i thought i was just going to have to put up with fly away hair the rest of my life this product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it it 's serious taming for seriously stubborn coarse or frizzy hair mine falls into the first two categories do n't use too much ! i use it after i 've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair even combing it gently in to reach every strand for the first time in years my razor cut layered hair is smooth	15
1	like any other leave in creme conditioner anything if you put too much of it on it will attract dirt i know this because i have baby fine hair and had to model in the dry dry deserts in the middle of summer needed anything leave in to keep my staticy hair down yes the more you use to more dirty you get \( but in photos you ca n't really see this but it felt nasty ! \) so wash your hair well condition towel dry apply sparingly like a touch and smooth into hair it 's not rocket science if you need a little more later add a little more	15
1	high beam is a nice subtle highlighter however be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting \( it 'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face \) it also has a tendency to emphasize pores so only use it on areas of your face where you do n't have any like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really ca n't say enough about it great for all types of hair ! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i 've made	15
1	i absolutely love this hairbrush ! i have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now i have not been impressed with any brushes this brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck you will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer \( the featherweight \) ! oh another thing i like is it extremely easy to keep clean	15
1	its pretty expensive for gel but i like it my hair does n't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day	15
1	its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire i like the sting and the shine of it it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it 's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong did i mention the great smell \? yum ! me and my boyfriend loved it	15
1	as a lip gloss addict i have easily over 200 glosses too faced fat kiss is by far one of my favorites the superb shine makes my lips look so good ! although it does n't really plump it still tastes like cinnamon and it will warm you up in winter i have two different colors because i like it so much ! i strongly reccomend getting a couple so you can keep them in your purse make up bag car everywhere ! this rocks sooo much	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
1	this is the second product of jonathan 's i 've used and i'm equally happy with it i have thin hair when it 's straight and something in the middle when it 's curly either way i 'd like it thicker and this foam certainly helps it 's great and i 've found it does what it promises it smells good and you do n't need to use too much it feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day it does n't matter if your hair is curly or straight hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as i have	15
1	it has a clean soap smell ! i also recommend the volume shampoo conditioner it made my hair feel very soft	15
1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
1	i have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks i love this product ! no build up no dandruf make sure your hair is wet not just damp and you should not have a lathering problem i purchased this from qvc and i will definately be a repeat customer i have short hair so this will last me a while i loved it so much i bought some for my daughter this is my new shampoo	15
1	i love the benefit line everything i have tried works great \( not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products ! \) that said high beam is simply amazing it only takes a little dab to add a nice glow shimmer to my face i especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow high beam works so much better for me than other products i 've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky not to mention those other products cost a lot more ! if you are looking for a little glow a little shimmer high beam is the answer	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	i recently discovered benefit products this is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin i use it to highlight my cheek bones you can use it any where you want a glance to linger the best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin i suggest you try this product it works wonders	15
1	this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really ca n't say enough about it great for all types of hair ! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i 've made	15
1	i am a big fan of this product my hair is very strong it needs a product which can keep it tamed however most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which in my opinion is a bad look for today 's fashions the matte look is more flexible american crew fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold it also smells nice not to strong and not too girly	15
1	i have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head the results are great no unwated shine no gooiness very easy to wash off your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged reasonably priced and more available every day	15
1	this is a great product for getting the bed head look i can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild ! trust me the results are great if you apply too much you 're hair will get oily the good thing is that this product washes out easily with any shampoo	15
1	this stuff is great i used to buy new gels pommades pastes etc every month because i could never find one that worked exactly how i wanted it to but i first tried this a year ago and it 's all i 've used since and it lasts a long time so do n't be afraid of the price one container lasts me about 6 months so you only have to buy it twice a year i 'll be ordering my third order of it soon	15
1	this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry i have long hair and i love using this product it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life fantastic	15
1	this is a great idea for a product ! for those of you who do n't wash your hair every day this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you do n't wash it i used this after 5 days without washing and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful ! well done	15
1	i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen up mist i have normal type hair that needs to be washed every other day and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day i have very sensitive skin too this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry and it feels awesome on my skin well done jonathan	15
1	i got a sample of this conditioner when i bought a similar product by another company i did n't care for the one i purchased but the sample was awesome and i am going to buy the jonathan conditioner i have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products i used this for a week and this is the only thing i have ever seen any kind of difference with i love it !	15
1	its effect very much depends on the climate you live in if you live in a colder and dry climate especially during winter it does exactly as it promises great moisturizer lines are diminished as is puffiness i really love using it i am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate but in hot and sometims humid climates or during summer it just does n't work as well i do n't know why i like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle although i am using it as a seasonal eye care	15
1	i could n't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness but it 's fab for great feeling eyes the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk	15
1	i never wanted to waste my money on a manicure because my polish would be chipping peeling by the next day my pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff and low and behold it worked ! it kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to vegas	15
1	sounds like a pitch but something about benefits sharpeners has obviously been designed better to sharpen without the usual amount of waste these are all i can use anymore	15
1	cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance that certainly is chanel no 22 it 's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no 5 coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no 22 for the year it was presented it may have been created in 1922 but it 's as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray	15
1	i have always used what i thought the best skin products but after using relastin for only a few weeks i was pleasantly surprised to see how amazingly this product has revitalized my skin ! at this point i am sold out to relastin and will only use this product	15
1	i 've been wearing makeup to some degree or another for over 30 years and i 've never ever found foundation as good pure non irritating glow y or simply as perfect as bare minerals i truly believe it cleared up my adult acne within a month that i started using it i just ordered this kit and i'm confident it will perform as well as the other products i have by this company do n't waste your on the imitators everyone 's jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon now but this original line is hands down the best	15
1	love the bare escentuals line of products not one for makeups to begin with this allows me to even out my skin tone give vibrance and is good for the skin have never had any skin problems with this line and believe me my skin is sensitive	15
1	i 've been using strivectin sd for almost two years there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't get a complement on my skin i do n't wear any make up aside from lipstick my skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible i'm in the beauty business and i recommend this product to my customers i am not a spokesperson for the company only a happy and satisfied customer	15
1	i 've gotten a few compliments on it by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent moreso than the big bottles i bought the 50 one and i do like it but i think it 's gonna take me awhile to finish it so from now on i 'll buy the 1 7 oz first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent but overall very fresh and sweet smelling	15
1	obviously some people do n't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that does n't deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it would n't be the bestselling perfume right now but do n't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better	15
1	i 've tried all types of eyeliner and they all end up smudging or flaking off very messy by the end of a long day \( or night \) i bought this one to wear at my wedding \( in the fantastic chocolate shade \) and it was absolutely perfect ! well worth the price great wear easy to apply \( with a very skinny tipped brush i ended up using a tiny paintbrush \) and stays exactly where you put it	15
1	this scent is so clean and not over powering ! i love this product ! it lasts too ! there 's really no need to reapply	15
1	i was very pleased with this purchase the perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than i expected 1 oz to be i love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone ! great experience with amazon	15
1	i have always loved happy but i love my happy heart ! i wear it 99 of the time my guy loves the smell too and i often get comments that it smells wonderful not too strong just enough \) i 'd recommend this perfume to everyone young and old	15
1	i may be the only woman alive who does n't like happy but i love heart ! it 's a perfect fragrance not too strong but not too light it 's very feminine	15
1	this is probably one to keep away from the kids it smells good enough to eat and its frothy whipped consistency makes it even more tempting ! it 's a bit pricey but it lathers up really well i found that about a teaspoon full on my loofah was more than enough for my shower and it just smells amazing ! very refreshing and a definite mood lifter now i want to try the whipped body delight in this scent	15
1	the flavor and scent are great ! i continue to smell the sugar scent for a while after applying and it lasts on my lips for a long time it 's a nice shiny look but does n't go overboard	15
1	this lip gloss smells good goes on slick and stays on a long time great value for the price i love philosophy products they 're all great	15
1	i read many positive \( and very few negative \) reviews before i ordered my first tube i am 65 living in florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months the cream goes on smoothly and i have had no negative reaction friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking with less wrinkles in fact two friends based on my favorable experience are also planning to purchase kinerase	15
1	foams nicely in the tub rinses away cleanly skin is n't left with any film instead your skin is left very soft and with a good scent falling in love smells sweet and relaxing and makes me think of cotton candy the large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower	15
1	i must say that i have been really impressed with this product i tend to have skin that is combo oily which results in occasional pimples here and there not really acne but annoying blackheads and bumps i had been using something else similar to this with ok results however within just 2 days of beginning this i noticed immediate results my breakouts have been a non event and even if i get a pimple here or there it 's gone in a day i 've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard to eliminate blackheads my skin feels much smoother and my pores look better i do n't see how i could ever be without this	15
1	this is the only blemish treatment that i have ever tried that will get rid of anything ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down you can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up it isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though it is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face it 's a little pricey but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
1	i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it in beige i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage fast shippin	15
1	this being my first badger brush i do n't know how competent a reviewer i can be but i am really happy with it it is large enough to hold a lot of foam \( sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much \) it is fairly heavy and robust which i also like i 've been using it for about 6 months now and have a feeling that it is going to last for years make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use for anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush i highly recommend this page as a intro	15
1	i have been using strivectin sd eye cream for one month i am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone so i cannot comment on wrinkle restoration my goal is prevention however i have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that i have had for 10 years applying strivectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks i am of course hopeful that it will disappear completely with continued use i never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and i was thinking of having a laser treatment \( a bit scary though near the eye ! \) i am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it	15
1	laura mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon bons you ca n't have just one she makes it easy for us with her eye color duos 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact while there are five appealing color combinations all fresh and sheer my current favorites are moss and azure with two colors one light and one dark i have a veritable palette of possibilities each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid or the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect colors are intensified by a second or third application \( a sponge tipped swab is very effective for this \) merci mercier !	15
1	i want one in every color it glides on very smooth and the color lasts	15
1	i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this product although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there this product is great totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne yes it 's pricey but i think it 's worth every penny	15
1	if you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it then this works out well it will not remove the zit but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well ! ! i put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use oh yes and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits a girls new best friend	15
1	if you 're like me you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time benefit 's boo boo zap ! is a bit spendy for such a small amount \( about the size of a small tube of lipstick \) but it does help while it wo n't erase the zit overnight it will get the red out you can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear not tinted definitely worth a try	15
1	i used this product in the evening and noticed immediate plumping i also use lipfusion xl \( 50 00 \) but sometimes the results are not long lasting when i used the too faced lip injection mask the results were immediate and seemed to continue for hours when i woke in the morning my lips were very plumped much more so than with lip fusion alone i will use these products together the lip injection mask from too faced is amazing ! used first then with lip fusion xl layered on top after rinsing off the mask it seriously looked like i had undergone medical procedure lip plumping ! i highly reccommend this lip injection mask	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in manhattan the yves st laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in what a difference it made a worthwhile investment i use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch up concealer and brightener covers freckles and sun spots too	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
1	my wife bought this lipstick in spain and was happy to find that she could purchase it in the u s also it 's the perfect color for her and does n't smudge	15
1	this is a great product however i would like to know if its organic a very good value too	15
1	i 've used paris hilton perfume for about a year now ordering it online at amazon was terrific i did n't have to drive and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store ! ! ! if you have n't tried this fragrance please do so you will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel ! donna	15
1	this paris hilton perfume is wonderful i got it 2 months ago in september as one of my birthday presents from my mum i 'd heard of the paris hilton perfume a while back but i thought it would n't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and i was really shocked the perfume smells delicous every time i have it on i get tons of compliments it really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day i have had a lot of perfumes in my life some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever i would recommend this to anyone	15
1	very rich a little heavy though can cause buildup but still excellent quality	15
1	this is awesome for thick curly hair apply when wet and it absorbs and keeps you moisturized for days also good with shea butter to 'slick smooth' edges for a ponytail	15
1	i absolutely love this product ! it 's been effective on both my natural and now permed hair it 's worth the price i have n't found anything on the market to match it yet	15
1	this product will not work for everyone it 's not really for people with straight fine hair it 's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled thick natural hair i apply about a nickle size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before i style it it leaves my hair soft manageable and conditioned eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy the aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste but i can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work i give it 5 stars	15
1	i love this product it has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times i use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place as some people mentioned it can make your hair greasy you have to make sure to massage it into your hair and only use a little	15
1	i liked this product so much i'm buying some for my family members who live out of town ! only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft shiny and moisturized and it 's great on my ends especially with roller sets ! plus my darling hubby loves the scent i use it along with the khoret amen hair oil	15
1	this product is fantastic ! i use it for my daughter who has very thick beautiful and coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it is not unmanageable and leaves it shiny and soft this works well with the hair balm ! !	15
1	i have tried many face cleaners murad acne clarifying cleanser and it is great murad acne clarifying cleanser has a nice scent and leaves my face feeling tingly clean without dry it out murad acne clarifying cleanser helps control my acne and i would recommend murad to anyone who needs help with acne	15
1	this oil smells so good i just love it all of my friends say i smell so good	15
1	i have very thick hair i stopped relaxing it one year ago and felt it was not very easy to manage i found the kerastase shampoo and combined it with the smoothing mask and my hair became much more easy to manage ! now i can comb through it as soon as the conditioner is rinsed	15
1	my significate other bought the shampoo for me i use the hair butter and various other products from carol 's daughter i was very fortune to actually make it to the store in new york i have very short barber style hair and the scent drives people wild i will continue to buy these products if you like the fruity tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based carol 's daughter is for you	15
1	this is a wonderfully light sunscreen that makes my face feels very smooth definitely worth the money ! if you do buy this product make sure you apply it over your moisturizer otherwise it will flake when it dries	15
1	this is an excellent product but i have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face at first i thought it was because i used too much but even when i use only a tiny amount it is still white it will certainly suit persons with pale complexions wish there was a tint to it	15
1	if you want an spf that is strong light non greasy and does n't smell this is definitely it i am addicted and will never use anything else	15
1	i absolutely love this scent i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you 'll love this	15
1	i 've been using city lips for the past 6 months and i absolutely love it ! i especially love the moisturizing effect i used to have to use chapstick constantly but now i never use it my lips now are always soft and moisturized and fuller !	15
1	citylips has made my lips larger ! i love the clear i use it all day long i will buy this product again	15
1	when i first tried this perfume it reminded very much of victoria 's secret pink it had that same distinctly sweet strongly scented unique floral note yet here the bouquet was significantly softer sweeter it would work well for someone who likes a sweet girly scent that is light yet still pronounced the one drawback is that the staying power is poor i could n't detect any trait of this just a few hours later this is a bit disappointing give the high price yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and does n't mind having to reapply	15
1	i absolutely fell in love with this fragrance it smells like a day at the county fair absolutely lovely you have to layer it though to make it last wash with the shower gel put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath \( perfumes stick better that way while you 're moist \) and then spray if you wash your hair spray while your blow drying it out carry the spray in your purse you will need to touch up during the day	15
1	i was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me i tried the shower gel first loved it had to try the perfume everyone loves it ! my friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too ! of course i said yes everyone needs a little love ! we both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it it goes on very light an extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent	15
1	this scent is truly intoxicating i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore this product line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume how nice is that ! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good	15
1	i have to admit i'm a very picky perfume shopper but flower by kenzo is amazing is light flowery elegant casual truly wonderful	15
1	i have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them i 've tried different brands and always come back to this one they have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too powdery	15
1	this product really does feel like silk out of all the eye products i really like this one i would recommend it !	15
1	love this scent definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while perfect for everyday wear it has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that 's not your bag i would n't recommend it	15
1	im really sorry about my review below my friend did it without me knowing off my accout im really sorry	15
1	i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove but that 's just me i'm not a huge clove fan but it worked great made my hair scalp feel awesome will definitely buy this again and i ca n't wait to try other lush products	15
1	i love this shampoo it make my hair so soft and shiny i cut the shampoo in four and use it every other day then i keep it at dry place this shampoo last long too the smell is great too love it ! i'm going to buy it for my mom	15
1	i just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized kabuki brush i find i like the baby buki better it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which i love	15
1	my title says it all this smells so amazing and is such a lush and fabulous lather that i will never wash with any other soap again i even bought the perfume because i found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower it 's fantastic it 's totally worth the money and it lasts a long time one bottle lasts me 2 3 months bathing every day i 've even used this in my hair before but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and i need a lot of moisture because i have blonded curly hair	15
1	the kerastase line is hard to find \( used to be only sold in kerastase salons i believe \) the shampoos do exactly what they say in this case this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated i only wish they came in larger bottles	15
1	i have straight hair and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful the smell is strong but i like it though everyone wo n't use very little of the restorative treatment or your hair will be very oily	15
1	i use renergie microlift active redefining treatment as a preconditioner prior to the placement of foundation on my face i cannot imagine using anything else i find it challenging to find a product that allows my foundation to go on silky smooth yet without feeling greasy or causing blemishes i am in my fourties and this is the best product i have found	15
1	great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft	15
1	everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received	15
1	this product is the best of this type i 've ever used i would recommend it	15
1	this is the best concealer i have ever worn it covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes not greasy either the powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling however i gave this a four star because it is pricey amazon should try and give customers discounts	15
1	this stuff goes on easy stays well \( but will rub off with water wo n't withstand a good cry \) nice not quite as nice as the victoria 's secret liner \( i swear by that stuff discontinued 3 4 years ago \) but way better than anything cheaper i have tried other things plus wo n't irritate my very sensitive eyes	15
1	this eyeliner really matches the description it goes on super smooth and does n't tug or drag i was told at the counter that it was water resistant but it 's really not i used to wear it under my lower eyelashes but by the end of the day it would be totally smudged and gross i would even try to put powder over it but to no avail however in defense of laura i am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes are n't friendly to many pencil eye liners i was just hoping against hope that laura 's would be different ! so now i only use it over the upper lid	15
1	i have used many many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement i am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades leaves my skin beautifully soft super smooth and all without added perfume \( who 's going to smell your face \? \) and additives i have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and does n't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation is n't that the whole premise and purpose of kinerase anyway \? great stuff	15
1	i have tried so many products b c i have tiny laugh lines and i am so not ready for them yet this product has helped beyond belief ! i love it ! ! ! i wanted to write a review because beauty products are very expensive and i wanted to say save your money and do n't buy anything but kinerase if you want results ! it is awesome ! !	15
1	i bought this 3 in 1 for my fiance' because he loves banana stuff we were both very pleased with it it does smell just like bananas i'm hoping philosophy will come out with a body souflee in the scent soon	15
1	this is the best long wearing lipstick i have ever bought it lasts on me for about 6 7 hours through meals drinks etc the best part is that it is n't flakey it also has little hints of glitter in it that really make your lips shine the icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell	15
1	this is hands down the best all day lipwear i have ever owned i own alot ! ! ! not only does it stay on all day beautifully but it does not dry your lips out with other extended wearlipsticks you are given a seperate hydrating gloss sephora maniac long wearing lipstick does not need it my lips never dried out and looked moist and smooth all day not cakey and cracked as others tend to do purchase this lipstick with cofidence and without hesitation you will not be disappointed	15
1	i like this scent my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so very fresh and sweet but not too sweet crisp and spring like a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this	15
1	beauty is hard work and savvy and so is this product you 'll find your fresh alluring face that 's been hiding since you were a young child	15
1	i have purchased many different brow pencils over the years and finally found one that is truly wonderful ! the color is perfect and the application is easy and the results are phenomenal the bourjois precision eyebrow pencil is the best i 've ever used i highly recommend it also the brow brush that comes attached to the cover is very nice and leave the brows looking 'finished' and natural i have senitive skin and had absolutely no problems with this product	15
1	i purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it it is a great lower end badger hair brush it also conveniently transforms as a metal cylinder for easy travel	15
1	this keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap so they can buy it for themselves i have the pixie flavor and it is great but it fell off my purse once so that 's why i am not giving this item five stars if they made the keychain a little stronger i would definetly give it a five	15
1	i recently bought all 3 of hard candys key to my heart lipgloss there are 2 different shades of lipgloss a sheer shade and a darker thicker shade my favorite one out of the 3 is pop it is a sheer light purple with shimmer and a darker purple gloss they smell and taste like candy it dangles on my keys and it is so cute ! it might be handy to bring a pocket lipbrush with you so it doesnt get on your fingers	15
1	this product actually works as described it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks the scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother i highly recommend this produc	15
1	to be totally honest i'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about but i do know one thing this stuff really works ! after using this for a couple of weeks i started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face it was n't dramatic but i kept using the repair formula and about a month later i could definitely see a difference ! people have commented on the way i look and i recommend it to all of them it just makes your skin look healthier	15
1	no wonder this is a bestseller ! the results are highly visible and real fast i noticed a change in my skin 's pigmentation just a few days after using it highly effective i recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality product and tired of just fancy labels and marketing	15
1	i 've been using this product for a few years now and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather i once did a comparison between cortisone cream and dream cream and the dream cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did the scent is lavender herbal and very nice	15
1	i have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck that dream cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks i 've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after i get out of the shower on my legs it has completely gotten rid of the red bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter i 've tried dozens of body lotions creams and this is my absolute favorite	15
1	i absolutely love lush products and this is my favorite of them all it smells great \( kind of herbal \) absorbs quickly and is very soothing	15
1	the clean crisp smell of this 3 in 1 product will wake you up in the morning and keep you smelling fresh without overdoing it	15
1	smells great and it is wonderful especially the fact that it is three products in one	15
1	i purched two of the lemon shampoo my wife tried it and i never got it back i was fortunate to have ordered two or i would have gone shampooless \( women ! ! ! \) most excellent product and it smells good also order two or you to will loose yours	15
1	i really like this product i would not however agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent i would actually like it to be stronger and have less peel and more juice smell but it is a nice scent and cleans very thoroughly not the best i 've used but very nice	15
1	great scent and the body wash and the sparkling lotion alone is well worth the asking price i brought the same item inside of my local mall for twice what i am going to pay here and i never even had to leave the comfort of my own home thanks for the dea	15
1	this soap is unbelievable ! it leaves skin soft and smooth and had no added chemicals	15
1	i always buy this soap when i travel in france when i found it on amazon i was elated ! it is so moisturizing that i never need to use any body creams or lotions with its simple and pure properties of olive oil vegetable oil and mediterranean sea salted water savon de marseille is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin the large 1000gm blocks are a great value and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm bars great for ones' own personal use for gift giving the 300gm bars are perfect ! if you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream use this masterpiece soap	15
1	this soap works well for sensitive skin smells like olive oil but hey that 's why they named it olive oil soap	15
1	this is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from cargo i would very much recommend it the lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin the four stars are because i love smelly things and this one just smells like lipstick it could smell yummier i suppose but so far i love it	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	after looking and looking for the perfect brown lipstick that was n't red or too dark i tried this and bought it on the spot this is the best color if you 're looking for a shimmer and just enough color this lipstick is n't sticky dry or cakey	15
1	i 've used a nylon scrubbie for years the salux bath towel is much better ! i received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was it has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator i use it with a bath gel \( never soap it 's too drying \) and my skin has never been softer it 's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back it drys very quickly ca n't live without it	15
1	this perfume is my absolute favorite ! ! ! it smells so good i love it ! and this roll on is so easy you can just pack it in your purse and use it whenever its so convenient ! but you wo n't have to really put it on several times day once is enough the scent carries on all day long ! ihighly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone	15
1	i just love this product i felt like i was sitting on top of a cloud i definately am going to by this again	15
1	we really like this dish it allows soap and water to drain through you wo n't have the soap scum problem it looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it wo n't slide around on you	15
1	i love the smell of philosophy pure grace the shampoo shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume it 's not too drying either	15
1	i love the design on the cap but it makes my head look huge ive had it for a year and the elastic is totally stretched out with normal wear beyond that i would buy it just dont expect it to last long	15
1	i used many shower caps but this one is the best i recommend everyone to have it	15
1	this is my absolute favorite product by lush i received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday and out of the whole thing this was the best ! it made the water a nice purple color \( without a ring around the tub \) and made my skin smell great even the next day ! i would recommend this one to any first timers so you can see what the buzz around lush is all about ! i am stocking up on this one	15
1	blackberry bath bomb is really relaxing it turns the water a pretty purple color and smells sleepily sweet it 's fairly moisturizing too	15
1	you can feel the huge difference when you put it on it 's really good for normal to oily skin everytime i have a big pimple i put a tiny drop on it before i sleep next day the big pimple almost disappears it 's a magic cosmaetic i will recommand to everyone	15
1	i am no ladies man but the ladies love the givenchy sent it is a young hip classic cologne ala dcg issey miyake etc	15
1	this vitamin e moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell and feels great on my skin i was given a sample which i took home and tried and i was blown away by this product i went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product i love it	15
1	i love this soap normally i'm not a bar soap person but this bar really has won me over it smells divine and lasts forever also my skin does n't feel too tight or dry after a bath with this product it is even a pretty color what more could you ask for	15
1	this soap smells great ! smells just like a cherry lollipop ! continues to smell even after the shower throughout the day mix with i love juicy shampoo american cream conditioner and candy dusting powder	15
1	there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin you spread a few drops on your face \( and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well \) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup it does not irritate my sensitive skin \( i have rosacea and seb derm \) or clog my pores a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money	15
1	sephora roll up blotting paper is so handy whenever you have to freshen up this is great to use before you powder your face all you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face they feel weightless and matte skin just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff gosh disgusting ! best of all you get so much paper the roll is never ending ! it 's so tiny and compact you would even want to share them with your friends	15
1	this is one of the most perfect concealers i have ever used it goes on nice and creamy \( does not pull on your skin when applying \) and covers those imperfections you also do not need a lot of product to get the job done the colors are very natural and i have found a perfect color in sand for me i will buy this product again	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	i did my christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown the package arrived before christmas i did not pay for gas for shopping i did not fight for a parking space and i did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize my mom 's favorite cologne was also at least 10 20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing this is the way to go	15
1	i got this perfume in a set of 4 ohter perfumes from estee lauder this one is really special so good light i loved this perfume more than all the others that i got in the set pleasures was one of them	15
1	an excellent pair of shears sharp and durable i expect them to last a long time	15
1	i bought this along with the some kind of gorgeous foundation faker i do n't have the best skin \( oily \) but like a more natural look these two product together are so great i look natural but healthier and my skin stays less shiny all day i use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	15
1	beautiful scent not too strong and long lasting i am complimented on it constantly highly recommend	15
1	i have tried ralph lauren 's romance eau de parfum spray and i love its lush floral scent so romantic and sophisticated i use it only on very special occasions and i 've often been asked what perfume are you wearing \? it smells so good i spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long lasting effect so leave a scent of you behind with ralph lauren romance eau de parfum spray a perfume that means always and forever in bloom wholeheartedly recommended	15
1	i have tried i think every product on the market nothing was helping my acne it just kept getting worse i still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this i loved it it did dry my skin out a little but whatever works ! my skin is clearer and smoother it just is n't perfect but who is	15
1	i love this kit my skin feels like velvet new blemishes clear up in a day or 2 and my makeup goes on easier than ever i love philosophy and i 've just bought the booster shots kit to increas ethe effectivness philosophy has gotten me addicted to skincar	15
1	this product is true to its title it is a silk infustion ! ! it made my hair turn from dry and frizzy to silky and soft i hope they do not stop making this product !	15
1	the shade i use is subtle lips i love it ! it gives some color but not so much that i feel done up i could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great and yet it looks great on sundays too because of the mild color it matches everthing and unlike lip gloss it 's not sticky at all \( i ca n't tolerate any stickiness ! \) i am only somewhat picky about scent and taste and to me this one has neither i think it is by far worth the 20 ! !	15
1	the bottle is a good amount for the money and the scent is great last all day	15
1	this one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences it 's not too spicy not sickeningly sweet it 's not trying to do too much just effortless one thing i like about this you 're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses i hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air this one has restraint staying power is debatable but it 's such a wonderful confident woman scent i gave it 5 stars	15
1	this is really a nice product for staying fresh and clean feeling during long flights	15
1	personally i love it i use the lipblush as liner and lipstick for daytime ca n't live without it	15
1	this is absolutely the best concealer ever i have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup this stuff has n't been a problem ! it stays put all day long and does not shine	15
1	almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone it helps with a number or skin problems and i have sensitive skin so it 's hard to find a product that wo n't hurt me most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn this left my face beautifully soft if you 're unsure of this product or wavering at all let me tell you that you should buy it it 's amazing	15
1	this is a life changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing you just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow and it provides a perfect base twelve hours later the shadow is still perfectly in place i bought this at a neiman marcus store but the product is so good i wanted to make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it is !	15
1	i am very impressed with the whole bobbi brown line this lip gloss is no exception these lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end the colors are fantastic these glosses are all very neutral and natural looking colors none of these glosses are going to make you look too made up just make you look finished the texture is not too tacky or sticky and it has a light scent not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss i highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them	15
1	anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they do n't realize achieving great curly hair is a process there is no one product that can do all the work i have thick frizzy damaged curly hair i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold the curl enhancing lotion really really improves the look of my curls from uneven ringlets and loose waves to an almost universal loose big curl it 's beautiful ! the only downside is the tiny bottle for such a high price it should be at least 8oz	15
1	i love this light curing lotion ! it smells like orange vanilla creamsicle it enhances the curls in my naturally curly hair makes it more moisturized and smells great ! it has no hold so if you need hold you 'll need to use a gel over it love it and worth the s	15
1	wow ! shesheido has done it again ! i love thier products ! i have oily skin so i like to blot my face once a day the papers are awesome very soft they soak up the oil and i can tell after i throw the paper away usually 1 sheet a day is all i need and my face is shine free ! i love them ! i also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most i have seen so far i love this product and will buy again	15
1	it 's interesting to see all of the oil that this takes from your face it really shows on the paper and it does it 's job not as cheap as washing your face but more fun	15
1	i really enjoyed that this powder let your face looking clean and matte finished instead for shine with glitter like some other bronzers do	15
1	i love this smell its sweet yet warm not too sweet though just right very inviting and you can wear with anything anywhere alot of compliments ! with this one will buy again ! and again	15
1	i first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure it got me curious as they rarely do passing sephora i went in for a test and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent it seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo after a few days i still could n't get the scent out of my head so i went back to grab it up i 've only had this experience with a few other fragrences but they were of a totally different style angel by thierry mugler and flower by kenzo	15
1	the perfume is very subtle with a little hint of sweetness it 's not overpowering or musky do n't try to sniff the bottle or a sample it wo n't do it justice you have to try it on your skin to know how great it smells i 've had other designer frangrances but this is by far my favorite and i 've received a lot of compliments	15
1	all of the bbare escentuals are great ! they make you look so young and fresh i am 61 and people say i look 40 ! even my daugther like it ! she is very hard to please great buy and last a long long time thanks ! ! ! !	15
1	i order the ash color for blondes and found that it is just the right color i also purchased the anastasia brow stensils with this item and finally seem to have found a solution for my thin mismatched brow problem i have ordered many bare escentuals products and love all of them	15
1	i was pleasantly suprised when i received this gift set the bottles are much larger than i had anticipated also the bag is super cute	15
1	feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products your lips will be glossy shiny and soft when you use this product	15
1	i have tried every lip plumper on the market \( no joke \) and this is the best \( besides pure cinnamon leaf oil which burns like hell \) i use b e products and i bought a couple of these bc i liked the colors i was not expecting it to work as well as it did now it is all i use on my lips ! it makes your lips feel cool not burning	15
1	i am new to the world of gloss and have n't tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list if you want something that plumps i would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you	15
1	i am so happy they are selling this now outside the gift set i have never had a lip gloss that tastes and looks and feels as great as this does ! i have amber and dolly and plan to try a few other of the colors as its the best i have ever tried !	15
1	i love this stuff i ordered it at a friends body shop party a while back i use it each moring after i shower and it keeps my lips soft all day ! i tried to find something like this in the stores but nothing even came close to being as good as this ! ! ! i highly reccomend it	15
1	very good product and great kind of fruity smell leave hair soft and full of bounce easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long the price here is still more expensive than in europe around 22 euros	15
1	these pencils are the best ! they are the perfect texture and they last a long time	15
1	i love this product it 's a lot more natural looking than foundation and saves a step in the morning it does a good job evening out skin tone and it feels good on my dry skin as someone who does n't wear a lot of makeup it adds that extra bit of polish that makes for a more professional appearance without looking too made up	15
1	i try a lot of products and this is simply my favorite not only do they feel luxurious they look amazing in my bathroom i sent my mom a set and she loves it too	15
1	hey i have been using min shampoo on off for about six months and can no longer go off the stuff because when i do there is dramtic difference as far as the smell goes i do n't need to smell like a coconut or a bloomingsdale just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair i do n't think it smells medicated \( unlike reviogen \) but just does n't have too strong of an oder if more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair	15
1	it smells as pretty and pink as it looks it 's not to gooey like other shower gels and i will definately repurchase it when i run out	15
1	this liner is thin as advertised goes on easy stays and is really nice stuff be warned though the lightest shade is really light and only good if you 're really pale it barely shows on me i'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even i should 've gone darker on the color recommended	15
1	i found it to have a little too much 'yellow' for my brows \( i have blonde grey hair but it performs well and i like the slim point i just mix in a little of my charcoal to soften the yellow	15
1	i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously lumpy legs i ca n't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot i 've done weight loss programs before and they 've never addressed the cellulite issue this is the first thing that has seemed to work and it 's great moisturizer too	15
1	my husband wears this everyday and i just love it ! ! ! i like to spray my pillow with it when he 's out of town ! ! great smell !	15
1	this is a very rich creme i find it works best for me if i use it all over my face once or twice a week my face breaks out if i use it more often i am 63 years old so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes but in that case i would recommend the strivectin sd eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance	15
1	i bought some less than a week ago i 've been using it over my brows between my eyes and under my eyes \( although the directions say not to \) already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically i love the tingly feel of it as well it 's super expensive here in canada \( 200 a tube \) but so far it 's worth the price i 'd definately buy it again	15
1	unbelievable results was considering botax when i heard about this product thought to try i have used several other products never saw results like strivectin sd used it as directed mainly between brows on top of the lips and the neck within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck have been using it for over 30 days family and friends are noticing it thank you for a great product got all my friends start using ca n't wait to try the eye cream just heard about it	15
1	brush applicator puts it exactly where i want gives my lips a great wet look without being messy never bleeds lasts for hours without touch ups this is the only gloss i 'll use	15
1	i have been using this product for about a year i love it it is a rich non greasy formula that gives my skin a healthy glow i use it alone and under daily makeup great for mature skin	15
1	these are great if you have oily or combination skin just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine it wo n't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere anytime these are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by mac cosmetics except these are cheaper and work just as great i 've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so i guess it would be great for a metrosexual lol ! ! ! you 'll love these as much as i do	15
1	i have loved this product for so many years but have n't found it for more than ten i flew to spain and the evian was an absolute necessity ! it 's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet it is very refreshing and also brightens fading makeup	15
1	love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes \) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun	15
1	great for flying keeps your skin nose from drying out	15
1	great for after the gym great for winter dry skin love it ! ! !	15
1	well i gotta say this one feels goodrefreshing cool calming gives the same feeling you get after you 've just washed your face	15
1	i absolutely love clinique for eye shadow all of their eye shadows go on so smooth never crease and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone the almost peach color is great because i can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base either way i use it just about every day !	15
1	this scent has sweet floral undertones but with a light clean effect many perfumes make me sneeze but not this line i get many compliments while wearing this i sometimes layer it with amazing grace another scent in the philosophy line you wo n't be disappointed	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works my skin feels softer and looks more even all around	15
1	i am seeing results after three weeks i love this stuff	15
1	i am a hair fanatic test and try everything this comb is the best comb i 've come across for my hair i have a lot of thick hair so this comb really does the job i have been using avon combs for over 5 years now and love them very strong and do n't break easily because my hair is thick i still need to use conditioner to help detangle it other wise my hair would be ruined worth every penny and for 4 99 you ca n't lose	15
1	i use the whole vitament e series \( cleanser toner spf 15 day cream lip balm and the nourishing night cream \) after a year in the desert my skin still looks great i just turned 40 and was carded for buying alcohol last month ! these are gentle products and work extremely well	15
1	this is a perfect winter cream for me and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin \( e g you rub eucerin on at night \) it is very similar to the regular cream in appearance \( pink \) and smell \( not offensive \) but it is much heavier i started using this during the winter when i discovered the regular cream was n't heavy enough and it works just as well it spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when i wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized	15
1	i wear stay neutral and have been using this product for years does n't clog pors and it looks flawless this is a really great product and work the 18 00	15
1	okay so i love love love this kit it includes everything you need to have awesome brows except the aestician lol i look forward to see what else this young lady presents us with	15
1	this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo	15
1	i absolutely love the smell of philosophy 's cinnamon buns like the other reviewers have said it does n't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented i only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense i like the other cinnamon buns products also i use the cream and the lip gloss	15
1	this is a sweet treat ! it smells good enough to eat it also leaves my skin smooth and soft it works good as a shampoo on my thick wavy hair too cinnamon buns 3 in 1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it totally worth the dough ha ha	15
1	i have very sensitive skin a thick beard and must shave daily what a hellacious combination ! the art of shaving for sensitive skin is the best shaving cream i have found and i have been searching far and wide as for the rest of their products eh i could take them or leave them i e there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper this shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non comudegenic \( sp \? \) oils that really protect your skin	15
1	i had tried all kinds of skin care systems with different levels of success but in the end the derma step system works the best with long lasting results you can get a free trial and see for yourself here http things4free biz dermaste	15
1	this products delivers what it promises i bought it as part of the makeup optional kit and now i am ordering 2 so that i do n't run out my skin is missing it so badly i discovered good skin i never knew i could have so i must have this product the antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin this is my favourite then secondly the purity made simple third the hope is not enough spf cream	15
1	i have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many so i have been pleasantly surprised with how much i like the pur minerals i sets nicely and i do n't feel made up i like that there are no chemicals in it as i have pretty sensitive skin this is not a heavy makeup so if you 're looking for max coverage this is not for you i love the mineral glow too it gives me the perfect glow without looking fake i will be buying this again	15
1	i recently converted to using powder makeup i am hooked i did n't tell anyone i was using it my son was the first person to tell me how nice i looked ! that truly made my day and was all the convincing i needed i absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel goopy like liquid foundation	15
1	this pur minerals starter kit is a great introduction to this brand i am absolutely in love with the 4 in 1 pressed mineral makeup \( included in the kit \) it 's so much better than the bare escentuals makeup which i had been using for years the 4 in 1 provides great coverage as it is a foundation concealer and spf 15 pressed powder all in one with bare escentuals i was having to buy the mineral veil foundation and concealer all separately and i still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well pur minerals is a wonderful makeup very lightweight and even the brush is soft on my skin ! i highly recommend it	15
1	having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks i was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores they seem to enlarge as i age came across this product somewhat by accident i was really amazed at how well it works just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth it mattifies the skin all day \( and i have extra oily skin \) other clinique products have made my skin break out but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks highly recommended	15
1	this is the best shaving product in the whole wide world if you exfoliate first and then use it nothing gets smoother legs for me my sensitive skin yes it seems kind of expensive but you just need a tiny bit at a time in a thin layer so it actually lasts longer for me than several bottles of regular shave gel it also takes up less space	15
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	15
1	even swimming for two hours in the pool i still have mascara when i emerge from the water would not be without this !	15
1	this product works very well on my fair nordic and sensitive skin it covers well but with a light non oily feeling and combined with a fluff og powder it leaves my skin looking flawless i highly recommend this product	15
1	this is not a strong floral fragrance and not sweet but it smells wonderful it just gets better and better on your skin very complex very different	15
1	my husband and i sat next to a woman on our flight to prague who smelled absolutely delicious a asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she replied marc jacobs i remember it was fresh and clean and subtly floral without being overly sweet now 6 months later i came across it in lord taylor sprayed a tester on my wrist and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating without more than 30 seconds of contemplation i purchased the gift set ca n't wait to experience this fresh winning scent over and over again	15
1	for a long time i avoided anything with gardenia like a plague it always smelled too sickly sweet to me this perfume changed my mind completely yes there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you 've ever smelled try it for yourself	15
1	i love this it smells so good diddy struck gold with this one as he always says preserve the sexy this is sex	15
1	lush makes a few products with lemon but i think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of vetivert the earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil use this conditioner after the daddy o shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake i can also recommend the honey trap lip balm and the smitten hand cream all that jas is also a wonderful product for the bath the rebecca review	15
1	moisturize and refresh yourself as you relax in this foamy bath your stress will soak away and you 'll feel truly happy	15
1	i really enjoyed this bomb it was very refreshing and relaxing it is a big bomb and i could have broken it in half but i did n't want to risk missing a thing ! so far i have been happy with my lush purchases and my favorite bomb is sex bomb but i would buy this one again or give it as a gift	15
1	i love zoya polish it is pure and the colors are fabulous they stay and stay and stay i'm ready to order again	15
1	i love zoya nail polish and this is the best summer color ever	15
1	the best i have smelled put this on your babies momma and you'l be smooching all night long you just wont wanna let your woman go if you r a woman buying this your man will go crazy for you and if he doesnt i will lol	15
1	this is not my first purchase from iman cosmetics i love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well i would definitely purchase this powder again	15
1	this is new for me i have been trying to switch all products to zoya due to the formadahyde free formulas so far so good	15
1	much better in terms of coverage than the new loreal makeup that diane keaton touts which is more creamy but just does n't cover as well avon 's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but does n't block my pores i highly recommend it	15
1	this product blended well into my skin and i forget that i was wearing makeup what is amazing about avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality i am usually acne prone so i am careful about what i use on my face it is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it it is very matte and can be worn alone	15
1	this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i have n't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i do n't want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and did n't know any better i would probably try to eat it	15
1	covers great \( i have read splotches \) and is good for my skin cannot recommend it highly enough	15
1	this powder provides excellent coverage without being thick \( thick powder base is horrible it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour \) my freckles are still there but my skintone is more even it did its job of concealer very well no red spots no dark circles and it works very well as a foundation powder much better than any other powder foundation i 've ever used come to think of it much better than any liquid foundation i 've ever used	15
1	china glaze is my favorite polish but perhaps it 's because they are the only ones i 've ever seen with this color 86 your touch it 's so gorgeous i 've had compliments on it nearly every place i go china glaze seems to have limited retail distribution so i 've had to order it online for years and this vendor was perhaps the best ever in sending it out so quickly ! great job	15
1	i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth after a week the breakouts went away \( they were minor \) and all i can say is wow my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc etc i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products	15
1	i love this stuff ! i have my mother 's hands as my sister calls them as the years go by they 're getting more and more wrinkly and i also have age spots i gave some to my sister last year and now she 's got me buying it too ! this hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy it 's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles you 'll love it too	15
1	seriously at first i thought it may be too harsh \( this from someone who has skin that can take a beating ! \) but after awhile i found it not harsh enough ! what i do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub trust me this stuff truly is wonderful	15
1	i am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products i received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty \( also good \) i was blown away by how this product made my skin feel i have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer this scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft i am totally hooked ! you will love it too totally worth the money	15
1	the best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent apply and leave on the skin for about 20 30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly then you start shaving it 's great because you do n't feel the razor on the skin as much which makes shaving quite pleasant i 've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is anthony logistics which i do n't think as nice as philosophy common man a little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long i would buy this again	15
1	i received this product as a x mas gift this year i really do like it considering the last two philosophy products i did not care for \( the gingerbread man bodywash and amen cologne \) out of the tube it 's a little thick but you only need a thin layer to do the trick it offers up a nice smooth shave and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward definitely a keeper	15
1	this is my favorite mascara in the world i 've tried many brands and nothing compares ! i'm sold	15
1	i 've never liked my lashes until i put this on what a difference	15
1	this stuff is fantastic1 it smells and looks like mint chocolate chip icecream \( too bad it does n't taste like it \) it cools and sooths the skin while exfoliateing away the dead skin i keep mine in the fridge as an extra cool treat	15
1	made my skin smooth and very clean i loved the minty smell will definitely buy it agai	15
1	when you buy this perfume for your girlfriend do n't tell her it was under 40 dollars ! i do n't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume yeah like it really smells better just because it 's more expensive anyway sarah jessica parker perfume has a really nice scent that you 'll want to smell over and over it 's nice that you do n't have to spend a lot of money on it either add just a touch for proper use	15
1	i love this scent it makes me feel good ! it is light but sexy it is not overpowering in any way so i even wear it to work i spray it on every morning to start the day off feeling good they say that scents can affect your mood well this one in particular really makes me feel great	15
1	i love this perfume it 's subtle and elegant and just beautiful	15
1	is there anyone that does n't know sarah jessica parker \? great perfume very nice smell	15
1	this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time ! !	15
1	i got the gift box i love it it smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend it smells money because it is so sophisticated i love how it wears it gets nicer as the evening goes on i like that in a scent	15
1	once again spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is worth it this is the only toner i have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over drying my skin i alternate with 3 depending on the weather	15
1	if you 're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done nioxin system scalp therapy is the answer \( the numbers only represent the type of hair you have use a lower number if your hair is more fine \) use this once or two times after color and the scalp itch goes away the product claims to help thinning hair i have no issue with that and i think i found an off market use for the product but it works for me so i 'll take it	15
1	this is a really fun gift for children \( although you might have guessed that i like them too \) it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful i would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though a regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster	15
1	whenever i saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores i always thought they were overpriced you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks and i did n't see a reason to pay more but i was given one of these and now i think it 's worth it it is a really strong file so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it you really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file it is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear by this time i usually would have killed a normal file	15
1	these are good and do the trick but it 's hard to get my fingers in the holes	15
1	this mascara goes on like a dream and stays put throughout the day without tearing or irritation your lashes will look like they belong in an advertisement	15
1	i was n't crazy about this mascara when i first put it on but it grew on me the brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however i love it now it brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply they 'll be long and nicely separated and the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day no smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where i feel like it 's a shame to wash my eye makeup off i'm really pleased with it i want to try lancome 's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper	15
1	the pores of the face become clogged with makeup cremes sunscreens bronzing gels powders etc exfoliation washing facials steaming do not remove blackheads whiteheads and clogged pores this simple product gets them out ! buying one will last a life time no need to buy another ever the ultimate cleaning device	15
1	bobbi brown makes excellent lip colors they are very smooth and have some staying power	15
1	this smells so wonderful ! wear it and you will get compliments it seems like it might be a summertime only scent \( i e very tropical \) but i 'd wear it year round i only wish they made a larger size in the oil	15
1	what i like most about these vitamins is that they are very small and easy to swallow unlike a lot of other hair and nail vitamins which are huge i am not sure if i notice a difference in the condition of my hair but i will continue to purchase and use the vitamins nevertheless	15
1	i took this supplement for 6 months and i noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance length and my nails ! ! i would like to keep taking it but i ca n't afford it for a while which i am really bummed out about it i definitely recommend this product it also has a huge celebrity following and now i know why	15
1	i have started taking this supplement a month ago and i feel my hair is stronger than ever also my hair loss has became minimal ! besides that my nails are harder i love it	15
1	i have the beginnings of crow 's feet the essential c eye cream has helped to decrease the lines and restored the elasticity and suppleness of the delicate skin around my eyes	15
1	i was given this product as a gift and i just love it i 'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup it smoothes this skin surface true the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone also i was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin it would create lines etc so i started combining the two things the tinted cream base and the philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and bingo this solved the problem so if you want a tint plus the smoothness you might want to give this a try	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	great towel for the gym or after swimming very absorbant and i also use one to cover the circuit machines when i use them	15
1	i first tried amazing grace a couple of years ago at that time i had a dresser full of department store colognes the scent of amazing grace is somehow undescribable suffice it to say it is the perfect fragrance and those other scents are history it is pleasing to the person who wears it and is pleasing to someone just walking by you some perfumes walk into a room before the person does or is so strong it makes other people 's eyes water we 've all been around someone like that not so with amazing grace it is just in harmony with you and those around you	15
1	i hardly ever wore a fragrance until i received amazing grace as a christmas present i love it it is clean and sensual whoever says this smells like a granny must have a strange sense of smell there 's nothing granny about it it is never overpowering	15
1	i totally disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny ! i do n't know what they 're smelling but obviously it 's not this it does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in but it certainly does n't smell like any granny i 've ever smelled i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance \( which is every day \) complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good i smell i recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance \( 1 spray should do the trick \)	15
1	i am a bonafide lush junkie and this stuff is what makes me so smells great works wonders and for 22 dollars of high end shampoo you could n't get a better deal this stuff will last me 4 months at least	15
1	smells great ! not too harsh on my thin but long hair	15
1	even better than i expected ! light fresh scent that is not overly sweet	15
1	i have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side the problem with most conditioners i 've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it they are very heavy and weigh my hair down i found out about kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at amazon it 's wonderful doing everything i need including making my hair nice and shiny without the heaviness i recommend it highly	15
1	expensive but a small amount makes a big difference excellent conditioner for dry thick hair also very pleasing fragrance the best hair treatment i 've found for my straight coarse dry hair highly recommended	15
1	this stuff is amazing i use candle light underneath my eyes and around my brows it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long it 's especially beautiful in sunlight really makes my blue eyes pop !	15
1	i am very glad with my purchase it gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one i am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and i prefer tinted moisturizers happy light gives even complexion without being heavy it also offers sun protection spf 15 if you do n't need more than medium coverage it is worth considering this brand	15
1	the charcoal in this soap acts as a sort of rasp for exfoliating dead skin cells the licorice extract soothes and rehydrates this is a very good soap if you have minor break outs or oily skin if you are very sensitive you might want to try fresh farmacy instead \( it has calamine lotion \)	15
1	i love auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume pink sugar to death but it is such an overpowering scent that i am often smelled before i am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate aquolinas new perfume chocolovers is similarly sweet but much subtler if you love the sweet scent of pink sugar but do n't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away try chocolovers	15
1	i bought this mostly because of how obsessed i am with pink sugar this product smells sweet it smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house i personally think of this as a good thing i love candy food scents my perfume collection is such that i am suprised i'm not followed everywhere i go by a swarm of bees if you 're looking for a sophisticated scent please do n't buy this or pink sugar if you are looking to have people ask hey do you smell a delicious cake \? everytime you walk past buy away and who does n't want to smell like a delicious cake \?	15
1	'do n't know what these others are talking about chocolovers smells yummy ! what 's great about this fragrance is that it 's not overwhelming and it 's not going to make you smell like dessert it 's got chocolatey tones but it 's not just about chocolate it 's warm and musky with orange oil hazlenut vanilla if in doubt you can always go to sephora and try a sample first \( see sephora com for store locations \)	15
1	neostrata is simply the best line of products i was introduced by my dermatologist 10 years ago they keep getting better i am 48 and most think i am 36 ! ! ! use all the products ! great	15
1	this is the very best hairstyler and hair dryer in one ! i have very fine thick shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me it is ! actually it is the best hair styling product i have ever purchased it dries and sets my hair very quickly usually in five minutes or less what a timesaver i am so delighted with this product that i purchased eight \( 8 \) to keep in my closet so i do n't have to hunt for the best product ever ! ! !	15
1	this light refreshing fragrance is a classic and you 'll use it every day the simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own	15
1	this is really good smelling cologne i hardly use it anymore though because of its current popularity gio may be the most popular cologne out there i would much rather be original than one of the herd you 'll have to make the decision yourself be original or smell like everyone else	15
1	i use to be a huge calvin klien fan until i came across this product i 've been wearing it since 2000 and have not been without it since the ladies love the scent which is obvious as i 've had women come up and sniff me in public \( yes public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone i have on \) forget bout those axe and tag promo 's in the real world this is the stuff that get you remembered not just noticed	15
1	every home should have some ! there is no greater soap for beautiful scent gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper a perfect gift and a must in posh top notch hotels etc some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy	15
1	i love lola lip gloss it is n't too tacky lasts a long time and the colors are gorgeous i bought the fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that i bought la petite menagerie as a replacement i love the idea of having it on a key chain so your never without lip gloss ! all the colors in this kit are great	15
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
1	i'm always skeptical of age defying products but this one really works i 've been using it since it first came out \( maybe 10 years \? \) and people often think i'm younger than i am \( 27 \) i'm not really using it for that though i use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne it prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples so fast when i run out the breakouts are back	15
1	it is a little pricey but so worth it to me ! i had a ruddy and uneven skin tone on my face and this has worked wonders for me i love this product ! it really does what it says !	15
1	wow ! my husband and i both use this scrub it is very refreshing the salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour ! like the previous review i feel the chill after getting out of the shower then i was full of energy ! i look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work ! this will be a staple in our household !	15
1	i recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by philosophy this is great for a hot sticky day and you want to jump in the shower exfoliate and cool off the first time i used it i have to admit i was freezing after my shower ! it has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour the smell is very natural not artificial like a few other of philosophy 's 3in1 it 's a combo of mint and wintergreen i would compare it to their candy cane scent i 've been using it reguarly after workouts it 's great ! ! a nice cool down	15
1	murad 's skin perfecting lotion is the best product on the market i have oily skin and this is a light moisturizer it did n't clog my pores or cause any breakouts its great to use in the morning and evening	15
1	not as much coverage as i would like for my mildly ruddy complexion but it definitely smoothes out skin texture and moisturizes very well	15
1	the strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like bonomo turkish candy i bought when i was a kid i like it but i think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on qvc other shower gels are creamier than this i 'll enjoy using this and the eggnog then go back to making my own	15
1	this is one of my favorites i love the scent it does n't smell like fresh strawberries because it 's not supposed to it 's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake \( and i think they did a good job of it so this is what i expected \) philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name the only thing i did n't expect was that i still need to condition with another conditioner i 'd say it 's a shampoo and shower gel a 2 in 1 not a 3 in 1	15
1	like i stated in the title this is n't my favorite three in one product from philosophy i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet i would n't say it smells artifical but it does n't smell like fresh strawberries either i have used it as a shampoo conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it i have fine hair and it did n't leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about	15
1	works exceptionally well dont use water just place 10 15 drops into bowl and like a tea candle creates warm and relaxing aromas	15
1	when i tried this on it washed make up and pores nicely but after i washed my face my skin felt so rubbery and a little too dry maybe because i didn`t get the right skin soap for it but when i tried other ones it still had the same effect	15
1	i find these soaps to be very good there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan if they are to drying try using the correct soap for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me	15
1	everything is fine except i was a bit irritated by shedding it leaves bristles on my face and they get into the razor i hope it will pass with time as other reviewers reported foaming action is very good and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar i 'll report again on this item in few months	15
1	i too am very pleased with this brush my previous brush had a ceramic handle that cracked this wood handle seems built to last the badger bristles are excellent i paid 10 unusually low price for a quality shave brush	15
1	this shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure badger bristle shaving brush i 've now been using it for a year and a half and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market the brush head remains densely packed and quite soft hopefully it will remain that way for some time to come in the meantime i do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush because of it i have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel they just ca n't compare to your average 1 50 cake of shaving soap and this brush this was a very worthwhile purchase for me	15
1	after buying some lush products from here i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful after explaining my horrendous hair issues they gave me some samples of rehab retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream they all work wonderfully rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft my hair has literally never felt better i highly recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter	15
1	i have dry unmanagable curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it ! because all the lush shampoos do n't contain any silicones it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it the squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up since i use rehab my hair is bouncy soft and shiny especially great in combination with american cream conditoner \( just love that scent !	15
1	this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me	15
1	for some reason chicks dig this aroma i 've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction i'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so i decided to write this review with my luck they 'll stop making the stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just in case	15
1	this is a really great smelling colonge really fragrent but not in your face strong i love to where this cologne before i go and do something really fun like going on a date or hanging with the guys cause i really think that this colonge is lucky there are plenty of times i was doing something mischevious and i swear i did n't get caught cause i was lucky \) get it \? i smells good and it is just like a rabbit foot with luck pick some up ! ! ! !	15
1	this is a great mascara it does n't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller longer and it lasts without flaking or smudging well worth the price which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands	15
1	i received a sample of this mascara \( in black \) and just love it it 's perfect for everyday wear as it 's not too dramatic and is very long lasting in fact it 's so long lasting that i even took a nap while wearing it and it did n't smudge at all i was pleased to find however that it came off very easily with my clinque rinse off foaming cleanser so there was no need for a separate eye make up remover i have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good definitely a great product	15
1	i really like using this product the color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle i like using this after i have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older the shimmer powder does n't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
1	this lip gloss is great not only does it taste great the initial stickiness goes away after a few moments and stays on longer than most other glosses definitely a must have for anyone 's make up bag	15
1	i love lemon curd so i was quite happy to discover philosophy 's frozen lemon custard lip shine the consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well this is by far my favorite lip shine scent	15
1	yum ! fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever i use this it smells wonderful deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge this shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin i do n't like it as a shampoo as much when i do use it to wash my hair i'm sure to follow up with a conditioner it 's a delightful product and i'm pleased with my purchase	15
1	this stuff smell delicious who can resist \? i love it ! ! smells like chocolate mint to me love i	15
1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	15
1	mally 's shimmmer shape glow is the best ! ! ! i love the colors and she gives you an instructional guide that aids you on how to apply the shimmer shape and finally the glow this girl knows what it takes to help you look like jlo or beyonce' on the street i cannot count how many times people have stopped and said how much they liked my makeup and i give all credit to mally roncal for her inspiration to help women feel girly try the product you will like it	15
1	i have been using this product for over a year only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes a little goes a long long way one jar lasted me about 4 months using every day this product blends into the skin quickly and i use it under make up it calms my skin i am happy about this product	15
1	save a trip to the dermatologist and buy this whitehead remover you 'll finally be able to remove those blemishes on your own at home	15
1	i finally did what i should have done before all the black marks i bought a blackhead extractor which is face friendly tweezerman makes fine equipment i use a lot of their nail instruments \( i'm a licensed nail technician \)	15
1	i have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color treated hair \( it is poofy and rough without any help ! \) and this stuff did the trick to make is smooth lay down and be soft in one treatment ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt damaged ! you need this stuff it smells good is easy to use \( and just use a tiny bit ! \) and works	15
1	it is a very good conditioner it is light and yet conditioning but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish it smells distinctively barnyard but i see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me	15
1	i have sensitive acne prone combination skin \( oily in the t zone \) i 've used various toners for months at a time and this is the first toner that does n't burn when i use it it reminds me of a better smelling witchhazel astringent i used witchhazel as a kid to help prevent my skin from breaking out it has a nice fruity scent which is great since most toners \( especially clinique \) smell like alcohol i just wish it was a little cheaper ! the bottle is pretty big so it will last me for 3 months which makes the price not quite so painful i use it with the clarifiance oil free gel cleanser morning and night	15
1	i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull ! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description i got a small sample bottle and fell in love it is perfect for the winter fall seasons not so much for the summer it 's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means but i still feel special	15
1	i have coarse afrcian american hair that is relaxed straight this conditioner is the best i have ever used i wish i could buy it in a larger bottle the only thing however i think it is expensive because of the price i use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair otherwise i would use it after every shampoo wonderful stuff	15
1	i gave this to my daughter for christmas and i do not think she has used it because i have used it every day and love it ! great for adult acn	15
1	heads up lightening fast very cute purple works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well ill be looking i love this thing	15
1	go read the review i wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product cheaper at qvc then amazon like all the other 30 or so products i have shopped around for in the last 6 months go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at amazon ! ! !	15
1	i purchased this after reading the reviews i had never heard of it let alone tested it i had some gift certificates thought i 'll be impulsive when i first opened it i thought oh no this is going to be heady \( or strong \) but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application and got even better as it settled my daughter wears vera wang princess and she too loves lolita it 's my newest fav a possible signature scent for me will def buy again	15
1	i have been looking for this eyeliner for years ! ever since they stopped carrying it at rite aid i have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2 99 lord and berry one i even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck this eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off	15
1	of all the other caswell massey scents i 've tried some are kind of old fashioned smelling high quality soaps in luxurious packaging not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps i 've tried	15
1	very paticular about how i smell dont just wear anything on my skin but this fragrance is just what a person like me would wear i so recommend this lovely fragrance to those women who so enjoy having the sweeetest smell flowing from their skin love this fragrance	15
1	the resort we stayed at in fiji \( maravu on the island of taveuni also highly recommended \) used pure fiji products in their bures and i fell in love with this pineapple soap we showered outdoors and the smell and feel will always remind me of our honeymoon i brought some of this soap back in my luggage but it was lost somehow so i just had to buy some ! we did get some of the shampoo and conditioner samples which also smell wonderful ! mmmm	15
1	this is a great cleaner but i 'd suggest getting the anthony algae cleanser first this glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave but overdries it is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems	15
1	this is a replacement for one i bought ten years ago ! i cannot put on mascara without my sepralash i give them out as gifts i panicked when the teeth finally fell out of my last one \( i used it to death \) ladies do n't put on lashes without one	15
1	i love this shampoo ! it smells wonderful is rich and thick and always wakes me up in my morning shower i have tried quite a few of the philosophy 3 in one products and this is one of my favorites	15
1	this stuff smells just like philosophy 's handmade hand cream but not as strong that 's why i took one point off it has a light sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background of course it 's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3 1 's if it where stronger scented it would be my favorite	15
1	i use this purely as shower gel cleanser and absolutely love it the smell is great not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning it reminds me of the lemonade stands i used to have as a kid easily one of my favorite philosophy fragrances i also recommend falling in love and strawberry daquiri in fact i do n't think you could go wrong with any philosophy products !	15
1	i am impressed with this new scent by philosophy it seems just like lemon pudding that my mom likes so well definitely a new fave	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
1	the citrus touch in this perfume keeps it from being flowery and potentially old ladyish it is not too strong even at first application but wears quite well you will not feel as though you are wearing perfume it seems far too light for that i would certainly recommend it for its versatility as well	15
1	it 's a lovely light refreshing perfume lovely for daywear loves it guys	15
1	i love this perfume because it really lifts my mood i always thought of it as a little more citrus y but it 's just a very fun perfume it 's also nice because it 's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way if that makes any sense ultimately it 's a great perfume and i wear it almost daily	15
1	this product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin i usually apply this cream right before i put my foundation on and it works very well together it leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky in addition to that it 's got a luscious cucumber smell to it i would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their moisture thirsting skin although it may be alittle costly it will last you about 4 months	15
1	i have amazing grace pure grace baby grace and falling in love these are the only scents i use now but falling in love was a bigger bottle than the other three and i'm almost out of it this is the best i 've ever smelled	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance i like and use a lot of philosophy products the only problem i have is that it does n't last long when i do put it on i get a lot of compliments when it 's fresh	15
1	i really love this gift set you will smell sooo yummy ! ! at first when i put it on it smelled so familiar then my husband and i decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy we love it ! although now i am getting hooked on amazing grace also a familiar clean fresh scent philosophy is great	15
1	i have used these for years and when i run out my skin knows and shows the difference i have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather cold or hot i carry these in my purse and have them stashed all over the house misting my face many times a day voila clear and moisterized skin ! they really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin and they keep mine from being red and itchy which makes me very happy	15
1	these are just great for cooling of quickly without a sticky feeling unable to find them in the stores	15
1	love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes \) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun	15
1	ever wished you could rub your eyes while you 're wearing your make up \? now you can you ca n't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never ever smudge one might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night but all you need to remove it is water this stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved	15
1	this mascara is great it 's easy to remove with a little warm water but the best thing about it is that it wo n't give you 'racoon eyes' there 's no dis coloration of the skin around the eyes it also keeps looking great all through the day no need to re apply it the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is that even though they come in different colors they all look more black than colored when dry so the color does n't stand out enough still i can highly recommend it	15
1	philosophy products are very eye catching their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each i work with skin care products and do n't always believe what they claim there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply ca n't be done to someones skin this product however is pretty good it 's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here it cannot be good for sensitive skin i 'd recommend this to dry skin people only	15
1	someone turned me on to this eye cream and it 's been like getting an extra hour of sleep a night ever since the best trick \? keep it in the fridge apply after you shower you can feel it tightening away	15
1	wonderfully light and clean scent ! both men and women have asked me what i was wearing hours after i thought the scent was gone it does not overpower when layering lotion and spray it 's a beautiful fragrance i love it	15
1	this is one of my favorite perfumes i love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets musk and iris it is a strong smell so go easy on it one spray lasts all day	15
1	i have had this for many years lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years it is very unique and the scent has a 'rich quality' to it the scent seems to change as the day goes on i really like it	15
1	this perfume is n't comparible to anything finally a totally unique scent ! it 's sweet and sexy and the scent changes with you i'm addicted to it so are the men !	15
1	i used the same mascara for years i came across bourjois pump up the volume on an internet site so i thought i 'd give it a go it really does pump up those lashes and it stays put for most of the day too i use this mascara all the time now i think its great	15
1	i got this as a gift last christmas and i loved it the scent is very nice and actually lasts i give britney credit for this one i need to replace it already thats how much ive used it its almost gone i recommend this one	15
1	i love love love this product ! this powder foundation has the best coverage out there ! i do n't like to wear liqued foundation because it makes my skin feel real oily this powder foundation is better than any out there	15
1	i love to include one of these with gifts people love them makes a bath really special little rosebuds floating in the water just charming	15
1	this smells good and the heart shape is cute but it lost it 's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish i liked it but it 's not one of my favorites	15
1	if you love roses this is a romantic bath luxury with seven rose buds for your bathing delight for a candlelit bath with romance let it dissolve unencumbered for scent but no mess put it in a mesh bag first because little flower bits will be all over the tub at least it has no glitter the scent is not particularly strong but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful	15
1	this is the one you give to someone you love the wonderful rose scent is very light not overpowering at all and the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming i love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me it makes me feel like i'm lying in a beautiful garden	15
1	well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there the smell is chrisp and will last a long time it is a great cologne for any acasion i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it ! ! ! !	15
1	i had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months i decided to go to the counter at the bloomingdale 's near my house the sa at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me i was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime i took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on not only that but it is long lasting and does n't crease i may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time	15
1	i love this soap ! it smells so fresh and my skin feels great after i wash with it ! i am definetely ordering more of this soap	15
1	this product is great ! i had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when i could not take the strecth marks the itching the pain the red skin i used it and it was like magic three days of use and i am a new person with soooo much better skin getting better everyday	15
1	i experianced a small problem that was completly resolved to my satisfaction what a great company to do buisness with	15
1	do n't be afraid to smile and do n't cover up those smile lines you can eliminate them with this amazing product from clinique	15
1	i was pretty wary of buying this because of the price but it really is worth it the can has lasted me almost a year and it 's not even empty ! it 's wonderful ! i have very oily acne prone skin with rosacea and this stuff makes me look like i have a flawless beautiful complexion and i'm not exaggerating it feels like i'm not wearing makeup i just ca n't say enough about it this is the one thing that i could n't live without you need to try it ! ! !	15
1	i have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have also my coloring is very fair red hair and blue eyes even with brown black mascara i always looked a little off matched the brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any i have ever used the ease of removal is the icing on the cake	15
1	it is my first time to buy fagarance the smell is so refreshing enhance my feminine and it do cheer me up i like it v much and will use this fagarance in the rest of the life	15
1	i really loved the clean citrus scent of tommy girl it has a grapefruit like scent very clean and pungent unfortunately after i became pregnant and had my son my body chemistry changed now it stinks on me o \( still it smells great as a scent but you may want to try a tester before buying it this is one of those fragrances that i think are a bit risky to buy sight unseen unless you 're sure your gal absolutely loves clean citrusy pungent scents \( but remember that does n't mean it will smell good on her	15
1	this product is the best my youngest daughter used it at my home and said she wanted the margarita then my oldest daughter said the same i like them both equally do follow the directions	15
1	the first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus it 's yummy and fresh and sexy then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in this is a wonderful fragrance for men both of vera wang 's fragrances \( for men and women \) are top quality multi layered emminently pleasing and would make fabulous gifts buy this for your man and enjoy	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	this is truly the best in highlighting products and i have tried many high end and cheaper products out there this is so light and just does n't get all cakey and greasy i have tried so many brands that claim to look natural but they just do n't this really does and do n't let the price fool you either it only takes alittle and lasts a long time so well worth the price for the look it gives i love this !	15
1	i 've been using touche eclat ever since it came out i still love it cannot believe how rested i look after i put this on my dark circles are minimized i look radiant till now no other concealer can beat ysl 's touche eclat ca n't live without this product !	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color i would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil this is a perfect neutral color i subtracted one star because iprefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush i think it looks more natural brenda christian makes a brow powder which i prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powderi can find sometimes i mix the two i start with the pencil and add a bit of powder all all it 's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils	15
1	i like that the gloss is n't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you do n't get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i was n't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but do n't know if i 'd buy it again	15
1	i bought this item as a gift but i have used philosophy products in the past they are wonderful and have an amazing fragrance ! ! and they produce amazing lather	15
1	i found this sent the most amazing i found it in the december 2006 issue of gq i was determined to find it i found it i was so excited i work at a fast food restraunt and i put prada amber on before my 8 hour shift and tords the end of my shift people could still smell this fragrance i was so excited i would recomind this to anyone who wants to feel safistacated	15
1	bought this for my boyfriend and i ca n't stop smelling him because it 's unlike any other cologne i 've ever come upon it 's so intriguing that i find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it i can best describe it as a soft suede with hints of amber vanilla and wood it smells better after it 's been on the skin for a while it does have a slight feminine scent however this makes me like it more and makes me want him to wear it more it 's definetely for a confident man	15
1	eternity was signature scent of the late 80 's early 90 's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful classic status now it is one of the best on the market it smells classy clean zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it always worth having a bottle handy even if you do n't wear it everyday it is a yummy scrummy scent	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
1	this is by far my favorite mascara and i 've tried hundreds' i have very few and very short lashes this mascara pumps them up makes them look twice as long ! love love lov	15
1	like the powder blush this eye shadow is silky not chalky it goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful all of the colors i 've tried are very nice toasted almond is a wonderful ivory american coffee is a rich brown \( but does n't go on too dark you can layer it for more drama \) caramel is a creamy beige this is a great product for everyday note you will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush it does not come with one	15
1	i have used this product for the past 16 years it is wonderful ! the super double face powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product the product comes with an application sponge goes on dry gives superb coverage ! i do n't even use my clinique concelar when i wear this product it is that good ! this product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin	15
1	as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique 's superpowder to be just the right product i have been using it for nearly ten years in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product it is truly no muss no fuss no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking and stays on all day with nary a touch up just perfect	15
1	this is a fantastic product and lasts forever so the relatively steep cost is not so bad this is a great product for using under eye makeup because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer or alone for a natural but still 'put together' look i love this product more than mascara and have n't found anything like it in other product lines	15
1	i have never found a compact foundation cream or powder that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it until now this is an amazing makeup and the best part is that it does n't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage my skin tends to be red but this does n't even hint at it plus it 's a nice matte without being too dry for everyday this is my time saving face perfecting miracle	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15
1	i'm really anal about scented flavored lipglosses especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass is n't that vanilla ish at all ! it 's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time do n't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off	15
1	i thought this stuff smelled fantastic and very similar to a lavender poundcake i guess smell is very subjective though so if you 're not sure about this one you might want to have a sniff at your local sephora or department store before purchasing	15
1	i received this as a gift and love it i do n't normally use dusting powders but this is light and silky the scent is very patchouli which i happen to like sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60 's 70 's i especially like the fact that all lush products are natural without a lot of chemicals	15
1	this product is amazing ! i have very dry skin and this just soaks in leaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days i even have used it for my shampoo times with good results there too	15
1	a time saver slap in on while still wet right after your shower instant moisturization if you 've got to jump in jump out and go and it smells delicious	15
1	this tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both as a rn with dermatology experience i have used many tools i like this one as it saves you from bruising or squishing your skin so it solves the problem with a minimum of damage if you have n't used anything like this it may take some getting used to but it 's way better than using your fingers i gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small	15
1	i love this scent it 's so fresh yet so distinctive light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you 're in close qurters with others but distinct enough that people notice it every time i wear it i get compliments on how great i smell	15
1	i really smell the peach in this and thats why i love it i love how its mixed in with the powdery florals its not heavy its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist i love this perfume	15
1	soft sensual made me feel feminine and attractive my husand agrees	15
1	if you love the scent of the bathina line benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent i wear this scent everyday and i always get compliments i love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin many scents smell different on different skin types but maybe baby is a pretty true scent i guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you	15
1	ok i have really large lips and for years i have tried everything to protect them get this tin for some reason the stick does n't work as well and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day it 's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily trust me i have tried everything even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick	15
1	i have been using this cream for almost 2 months now and the results are amazing my sun spots are lightened and it has also decreased the redness on my face i will continue to use it and highly recommend it	15
1	growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin as of late i have noticed sun spots on my face chest and hands \( yuck ! \) my esthetician recommended i try murad 's age spot and pigment lightening gel in about a month i noticed the spots beginning to fade ! it is super light weight and soaks in fast too ! now all i have to do is remember the sunscreen	15
1	simplify simplify simplify ! that 's what i try to do with my beauty routine hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one step cleanser i'm staying with it because it works no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers one step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished it 's both easy and effective	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	i like this product but am not sure it is worth the money i have bought other products for 5 at my local store and i seem to have similar results	15
1	i decided to try it out and have found the only soap i want to use the fragrance is great it does not overpower i guess the milling process gives the soap it 's texture which removes the need for all those bath shower accessories and 1 bar lasted over 2 months i will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries	15
1	the ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy the scent is strong but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting this soap is also so moisturizing that my skin does n't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels this particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a bath and body works shower gel and lotion fiend	15
1	body so fine is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic i ever had i recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real it 's the most delicious velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms also the retro chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful perfect for me	15
1	i got some of this body balm yesterday the lady at the benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a victoria 's secret model she put a sample on one of my arms and i held it up to the other arm the difference was amazing ! the arm with the bathina looked smoother silker and had a pearlized look i ca n't stop raving about this stuff it is slightly expensive but the tin is really big \( and adorable \) and the supply of the balm is huge it should last a really long time this balm is one of the best products that benefit has	15
1	i could n't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging and it does look cute in the bathroom that being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs your calves look great without stockings i find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there 's nothing better on bare legs to add a glow to the skin especially to a tan try benefit 's flamingo fancy	15
1	i 've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent but i have to say i love it this lotion takes me back to my child hood it 's got a strawberry quick bubblegum smell to it i think it 's fun for summer days	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	i use the dusty pink and i have never ever used a blush that looks so natural and makes my skin glow so healthy with or without the mineral foundation from youngblood just lovely highly recommended	15
1	i loveee this ring soo much it looks cute on my mdidle and index finger and the gloss is moisturizing with a touch of glitter all in one word glam ! !	15
1	here 's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list a cute lip gloss ring from hard candy the ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss it comes in three shades and glosses heartbreaker which is a peach kiss me which is hot pink and yummy which is baby blue all are fruit scented boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid \( presentation you know \) it 's finger fun	15
1	mastering the stencils does require some practice but the color is good for blondes i also follow up the powder with an eyebrow pencil to make my eyebrows look a little more defined i think my eyebrows look better since using this product	15
1	i loved this product the stencils are easy to use and the instructions are easy to follow the browns are a bit dark so if you have red in your hair like i do you might want to start out light you can always go darker if you need to	15
1	after watching anastasia do eye brows on tv i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows after receiving this kit i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves i do however shape my daughters brows in conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person	15
1	i love the product as an afterthought this was sent from sephora where with every purchase you receive a bonus sample and even free shipping if you qualify wish i'd went to their site since i'm a frequent shopper there also oh well amazon is where i will buy books dvds etc	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
1	if you have smooth skin this product is not for you my skin had no human quality about it after i went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments i suffer from extreme skin dryness uneven and dull skin other lotions made my face look greasy or failed to give it that moisturised look i have tried many products for my extreme dry dull skin issues and this is the first product that has worked for me now my skin looks hydrated and normal it is quite a feat	15
1	wonderful shampoo i have color treated hair and my color stays shiny and my hair is thicker after i shampoo i use the shampoo daily and no longer have scalp problems from product buildup	15
1	this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp very light and smells great	15
1	i was recommended this product for my son 's hair and have had many recommendations over the years since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy i used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls he is 10 and not crazy about the smell but i think it smells nice fantastic product	15
1	i purchased this product based on the reviews and i ca n't begin to tell you how glad i am to have the hair honey it is wonderful ! ! it leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy the smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater i will be using this for a long time to come	15
1	i just started using carols daughters products but i really like the hair honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front i just use a little water and hair honey tie a scarf for about ten minutes and my all natural new growth is smooth soft and exactly where i want it to be without using harsh gels sprays or spritzes i am using this and the cd healthy hair butter as a leave in i love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair	15
1	forgive me for the rhyme but the sentiment is true this product is rich but at the same time light after opening the jar i loved the way the hair honey smelled it has a sweet aroma but i did n't detect the cirtus smell in the product description i am only sorry i did n't get the larger size	15
1	really enjoy using this as body wash the smell is divine but the bubbles do n't last long if used as a bubble bath or shampoo moisturizing to my dry skin	15
1	i originally bought this item because i was hoping for the same scent that yankee candle produces in their candle line the smell is nice although it does n't reach out and grab you like true buttercream still it 's nice to shower with and you wo n't be disappointed with the lather i put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after i was finished also the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin all in all i am happy with my purchase i only gave 4 stars because i like a stronger scent but if you like more subtlety i'm sure you 'll enjoy it	15
1	this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important	15
1	wear make up every day and i usually wear foundation eyeliner mascara eyeshadow and lip gloss that 's my every day make up by the end of the day i have to get it off in order to sleep well lancome make up remover helps me a lot its very easy to use it takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing it 's gentle and not irritating it also smells nice though it 's kind of expensive it 's a good product	15
1	i use this everyother day before shampooing my hair is much less greasy after using it ! ! i 've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots it also has a very pleasant orange citrus scent this product is worth every cent i definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair	15
1	this is a must must must i love this kit all of the items included are awesome a must have you will probly not be disappointed gives the best smokey eye loo	15
1	i just got out of the shower a minute ago and i must say this is the best shampoo i 've ever bought my scalp has n't felt this clean and fresh in a long time washing my super thick and waist length hair did n't feel like a chore for once and i actually look forward to my next washing the smell reminds me of the hippie shops on haight street in san francisco i love it	15
1	for the price this product is great the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time the scent was light and fragrant not over powering like some other products for those who love their bubble baths highly recommended	15
1	i 've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles but the scent fades rather quickly if the scent lasted longer it would be much improved	15
1	i received this a a gift for valentine 's day this year it 's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam \( rather than big double bubbles \) it 's chock full of natural ingredients and no sls so it 's very gentle even for little ones i do however prefer the deep steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint	15
1	i love the scent of the grapefruit bergamot bubble bath this combination is suitable for men or women deep steep products are really first rate the foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money	15
1	i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it 's ust glittery but i love i	15
1	i used to sell iman when it was in a major department store this stuff would fly off the shelves too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else i stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else ! buy it you will not be disappointed	15
1	i have been using i man line of products for the past 5 years and have been a very happy customer this is my first time shopping for i man makeup online and i realize that amazon com has it for half price this is a fantastic deal and the product is beautiful for all skin tone my friends comment that i look flawless	15
1	knowing how i love everything pink a dear friend of mine gave this to me as a present i love the scent it 's not overpowering but has that lovely and alluring smell it 's so fragrant and i feel like i'm forever in a garden full of freshly bloom beautiful pink roses one of the simple pleasures in life truly pink by vera wang leave a scent of you behind wholeheartedly recommended	15
1	for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff non greasy no heavy scents it 's worth every penny	15
1	face oasis is n't like any other moisturizer i 've tried one application makes my skin appear plump and well hydrated even if i 've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day it is n't at all greasy absorbs quickly and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup the guys i 've introduced it to have raved about it as well !	15
1	like most others i fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years i had to buy the latest greatest design in razors with each new design the blades got more and more expensive until i realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money about a year ago i bought a merkur razor and have not regretted it if you are a newbie to this type of razor you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique then enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket	15
1	i have hard facial hairs \( thanks dad ! ! \) and after being gilette user \( last used mac 3 \) i finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with double edge \( de \) razor and blades merkur are the first ones i have used after the multi edge blades and after 4 5 shaves i am getting closer shaves \( w no irritation \) than by using mutli edge ones also to get better results i would recommend a badger brush which really softens the skin before these de blades with a good heavy razor \( merkur is a good one \) can smoothly get your facial stubs good luck !	15
1	this is the second time i have ordered these blades for my husband he has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he 's ever used that last anywhere near this long regular blades dull almost right away \( sorry he 's not here or i 'd ask for the details from him i do n't know how long a long time is \) but at 50 he 's tried a lot of blades ! he says never buy him anything else again so i guess these are the best ! ! !	15
1	this product is awesome nice texture great tingling feeling and very smooth clean feeling after use but i'm not sure if you should use it daily as exfoliators should only be used 2 3x week because they 're too abrasive so just remember that otherwise this is definitley a top notch exfoliator	15
1	the 2nd day i shampoo d with this bar it was amazing the compliments i received it made my hair right after going to the salon shiny i 'd highly reccomend this to anyone	15
1	like all lush shampoo cakes it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy i find the smell to be nothing to write home about yes my hair was shiny but it tends to be with all of their products do n't be scared of the glitter though it 's barely there all in all i prefer new and karma komba to this one	15
1	during the winter months i have flaky skin under my beard and on my face this product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that i 've used it i 'd recomend for that use i do n't think it has much of a scent at all certainly not like most soaps and skin care products	15
1	this is a wonderful addition to taking a bath ! the size is very nice quite large and makes for an awesome spa like exprerience in your own home ! the sponge is clean and has no smell rinses out easily ! highly recommend	15
1	when i ordered i didnt read the word double so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now	15
1	as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique 's superpowder to be just the right product i have been using it for nearly ten years in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product it is truly no muss no fuss no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking and stays on all day with nary a touch up just perfect	15
1	this cologne smells great a guy i know wears it and whenever he hugs me i smell this and well he smells fantastic in fact the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him i'm a big fan of the original curve cologne which smells really nice as well boys men ca n't go wrong wearing either of them	15
1	this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright shiny hair for me i have nice hair to begin with \( if i do say so myself \) but i used this in conjunction with one of lush 's conditioners \( american cream \) and my friends told me i had shampoo model hair that day i'm not crazy about the beer ish smell which is why i 'll give it a four rating however it does n't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it	15
1	i have terrible skin lots of scars stretch marks burns bruises acne etc but people always come up to me comment on how beautiful my skin is \( due to the makeup \) dermablend is way too dry \( i like to mix it with a little lotion before applying \) but it stays on even in water if it looks a bit flaky pale ghostly put some lotion over it any type of makeup looks bad if you do n't know how to apply it duh	15
1	i'm a sort of sweaty type so i usually like an antiperspirant deodorant but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash and it 's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy aromarant is quick and easy to use does n't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge	15
1	it smells beautiful and is very relaxing by far my favorite out of so many i 've tried !	15
1	i recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since up until now i have aways had a hard time finding them i have been usinghte same two for years now and i gotta tell you washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years i am so glad i can stock up on these ! ! buy them you will ove them i have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating	15
1	i bought this for a frriend and she love it so i have to give it 5 since it was not that expensive the only problem i had was the item was not giftwrap as i pay 2 99 to have giftwrap and it was n't so the gift wrapping option does not work very well with the seller	15
1	subtle yet powerful ! i love this scent i actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance many compliments from men women a little spritz does the trick ! you can also purchase a sheer moisturizing body spray perfect for daytime wear especially during the summer pricey but definately worth it ! !	15
1	so i 've been wanting this particular fragrance for a long time now and my boyfriend finally purchased it for me for christmas it arrived on time with no problems and also came along with various perfume samples what can i say \? it was exactly i expected to be no disappointments	15
1	i bought this conditioner for my daughter 's hair the smell is wonderful ! ! ! plus the product works great ! ! ! it now comes with a pump at least mine did which makes it easy to use it leaves my aa daughter 's hair soft and managable	15
1	i really like this product because i have a natural do products that are too heavy do n't work this is perfect for my hair it makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good	15
1	i have tried many different products and this one is the best i rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else i have tried four stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it you can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem especially if under makeup	15
1	i use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super it is easy to apply goes on clear and is very powerful it works to clear up that spot in record time i 'd highly recommend it	15
1	although i find this soap a bit sweet \( almost bubble gum sweet \) my daughter \( teen \) loves it all little girls would love this especially with the glitter stars and random colors we get it often the bathroom smells nice after a shower too	15
1	what a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow paula dorf says where are the brights \? not here and calls the shadows softly muted that is true but do n't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow it 's also named glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it the selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone i bought the gold which is subtle but is still gold i love the way it goes on and it 's suitable for day or night paula dorf will never have you looking like a clown but i do n't find these shades boring either	15
1	i absolutely love this chanel foundation it is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage i like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water based it can be worn in the daytime or evening use with chanel loose powder and chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish	15
1	due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity nursing babies and losing a lot of weight the girls need a little help \( actually they need a lot of help but we wo n't go there ! \) i have worn bra inserts from the fabric store the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad they do the job but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day i love the silicone inserts iinserted in your bra they look like the real deal and since they cling to your skin they stay in place all day i call them my ex plants ! love 'em !	15
1	i have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked initially i was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised it certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes it may seem expensive but a little goes a very very long way has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating and i have sensitive skin try it i do n't think you 'll be disappointed i was n't	15
1	if you need something to get you going in the morning shock therapy will do it we 're talking major minty shower gel here your skin will be tingling the smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain a gift note this would be a good gift for someone who does n't like flowery bath products even guys would like this	15
1	i use this constantly i 've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora i do n't blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry not too much but it 's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way i 've reccomended this to everyone	15
1	this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important	15
1	i was worried about buying this kit because of the cost but it 's worth every penny in less than a week my feet have gone from cracked and peeling to soft and healthy this kit is amazing	15
1	my boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck and he was very skeptical about using this now he does n't get any ingrown hairs and he does n't pick at them anymore he will not live without it now and we both recommend it !	15
1	tend skin was introduced to me for after waxing ingrown hairs but she said the secret was that it stopped itching from mosquito bites and within 24 hrs any pimple and just blooming pimple are gone ! ! ! i introduced this to friends at work and now everyone uses it we all have clearer skin when nothing else \( even pro active \) did n't work	15
1	the scent is so unforgettable fresh and sexy and sweet and it 's just the best among the best	15
1	this is a 'must have' fragrance it has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking what perfume do you have on \? it can be worn day or night the entire burberry line is fantastic	15
1	i'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents the candy apple is definitely the most accurate and i 'd sell my soul if i could only continue buying it on its own but the other 2 are good too the cotton candy is awesome but not 100 on accuracy and the cherry sno cone makes me start slobbering when i smell it highly recommended	15
1	this stuff is awesome if you have dry coarse or damaged hair this is lush creamy and lathers up well this is a wonderful luxury shampoo you will feel like a queen star when you wash your hair with this the smells is fresh and yummy i love using this stuff except i cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down my hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back i highly recommend this product and will buy it again	15
1	i originally wanted the black ginger aromatic candle but after reading the reviews it seemed that the red currant is the all around favorite the smell is nice but i think i expected something a bit different the candle 's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated and it seems to be burning slowly the candle itself is fine quality and comes packaged nicely ! if i found a scent that i liked a bit better i would be 100 pleased	15
1	i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled ! the box itself is decorative and i re used it as a pencil holder on my desk the scent is very aromatic and long lasting i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house i was very pleased	15
1	this candle is the ultimate pleasure ! it 's smell is not over powering but is pleasurable at the same time you will be sure to love it as much as i do !	15
1	i have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo my curls are well formed and bouncy and i use less styling product plus this line smells great ! it has a light citrusy smell that i wish they 'd bottle into perfume i even got my boyfriend \( who has curly hair like mine \) to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine i am hooked	15
1	i 've been using avon products since i was a teen i started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel i will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either though i am a dry skinned redhead contrary to what someone else here said i find that it does absorb very quickly i buy it because it is not oily oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn and this gives me no problems at all also i have sensitive skin so i have to use hypoallergenic makeup this fills that bill too try it ! ! it 's great ! !	15
1	i agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice it is very strong and i realized after spraying it twice it only needed once most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette very much worth the money i was complimented on it the entire day it does not resemble lemon pledge to me at all	15
1	i tried the lemon sugar perfume and i am absolutly in love with it it is like no other perfume i have ever smelled before i will probably be using it the rest of my life i hope they never stop making it i think everyone should try it the scent is lemony and sugar just like it says it is light and last a very long time i am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow do not just take my world for it order it today and experience something great and new	15
1	this fragrance smells great if you have used the awesome fresh lemon sugar shower gel it smells exactly the same it smells much better than the other sugar fragrance that has been around a long time this one is clean and fresh and uplifting	15
1	this is a very lemony smell and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon it is simply only that lemon and sugar then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day if you want to just try it get a sample size one from ebay or a mini perfumes website if your considering the more expensive clean fragrance but are n't sure about the price fresh lemon sugar is similar in scent the only thing being left out is the laundry 'air' fragrance	15
1	not your typical thick floral smelling perfume this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises like lemon juice mixed with sugar it 's a seasonal perfume \( i ca n't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter \) it smells very crisp fresh and clean which i enjoy a lot but i imagine others would not the same things i like about this perfume could smell like a cleaning product to others go to your fridge get a lemmon squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar if you enjoy the smell you get buy this perfume i highly recommend it if not stick to something more traditional and vanilla floral like ana sui 's dolly girl	15
1	i am in love with this product it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast \( i probably use more than i need to \)	15
1	after a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8 hours and a brutal workout after i came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience i have ever had by myself with a bath bar ! \) the cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar the cool air in the bathroom mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing blissful enjoyable shower i feel great ! i 'll sleep great tonight ! this experience has made me a lush customer for life	15
1	i havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it dont rub it on too long or you 'll have too much it melts quickly when it touches skin i love the peppermint cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides it leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize	15
1	i bought this after using other murad products and loving them i like this but i would n't say i love it first it 's a bit overpriced i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price the toner itself is decent but does n't seem to clean as deeply as other toners however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option non drying and does n't have that toner burn overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re purchase	15
1	so glad to find this hard to find item ! i have tried every kind of polish dryer but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath for years i have used dry and shine with the great success it goes on like lotion drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine and dry nails i love it ! ! ! it is magic ! ! ! !	15
1	a clean and refreshing scent not heavy at all its top notes are citrus based and this is appropriate for day or night wear it is one of my favorites it reminds me a little of happy for women which i love but do n't wear because of its distinctly feminine smell cudos to clinique happy is a terrific man 's cologne it smells clean but not like laundry soap \( which too many men 's colognes smell like these days \)	15
1	i have ordered a few of these as gifts and the recipients are always delighted responses i have heard about the products are marvelous ! heavenly ! and to die for ! and keep in mind that these are ladies who take there bath times seriously ! ! ! the range of flavors makes it easy to give this gift again and again the order always comes pre wrapped suitable for gift giving you ca n't go wrong with giving this as a gift i give this seller my highest recommendation ! kudos	15
1	i love to wear safari several times a week someone will ask what kind of perfume i am wearing and comment how nice it smells i will continue to wear it until i can no longer get it someone said it is discontinued does anyone know \?	15
1	my skin was winter dry and i expected this product to have richer moisturizing qualities the scent is nice but quite strong not a 5 star product as i usually get at body shop but works fine for more balanced skin	15
1	i love this scent it smells warm and spicy on my skin the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful it also lasts all day long which is great because i'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal	15
1	this fragrance is both sexy and playful it truly embodies the essence of a woman both men and women find it to be a truly amazing scent	15
1	these candles smell true to their names make the room smell nice but are n't overpowering they do smell good when you burn more than one scent too	15
1	i light this candle every other day in my bedroom because i enjoy this scent so much it is a very light scent but the smell does fill a room quickly if you like the amazing grace and pure grace lines from philosophy you will like the clean crisp white candle the candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that i did n't want to throw away great for gifts	15
1	tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers i 've ever purchased they stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise quick and virtually painless and when they do go dull all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so they arrive back good as new you ca n't beat that !	15
1	i'm sure that you do n't need any more assurance but just to let you know i 've had my tweezerman 's for over 5 years now they are still sharp ! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably would n't be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have	15
1	i got this as a gift from my mother last year this product saved my hands and feet ! it helped them stay soft no more itchy ankles or knuckles i preferred to use this at night but i do use it on my feet almost everyday before i put my socks on for the day it moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling	15
1	i like this lotion it is moisturizing retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf	15
1	very moisturizing and smells nice too the sea minerals and exfoliating ingredients keep my cuticles looking good and help cut down on hangnails too i apply lots of it at bedtime	15
1	i love this fragance it 's my favorite no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it i love it	15
1	givenchy 's very irresistible is magnificent ! floral yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base better than bob mackie 's perhaps perfume and infinitely complex so that the scent is never tiresome irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates this perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try !	15
1	love love love this scent i have received many compliments about it long lasting and definitely addictive i think its more of a late fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	15
1	this product is perfect for dreadlocks i buy it whenever i am in the us i live in the caribbean and even in the extreme heat this stuff is the best for my hair type	15
1	i have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this did n't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head it also has a great light scent that does n't compete with the other hair care products i use like the vanila leave in conditioner and the hair butter	15
1	it smells good and made me hair relly soft it did lighten it a little bit but i also used the blonde with it after a while i think my hair will get even lighter highly recommended	15
1	i love this conditioner ! it smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk ! my hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour regardless i recommend this product highly especially for dry damged hair i recommend this product in conjunction with new ! \( hair \) solid shampoo bar also made by lush cosmetics	15
1	i 've had my marilyn hair treatment for some 3 months and it makes my hair smell great ! kind of like a smooth scent in my hair it did n't really lighten my hair but it smells great and it did add some extra softness to it	15
1	got this sample from a friends mom who worked for a major department store and i loved it but i could n't believe it was a scent from clinique ! love that it 's light and has little hints of powder and citrus to it i definitely recommend this scent especially for the springtime great for daytime wear	15
1	the gel has a slight tingling sensation but it does n't itch or burn and after using it for a few times the tingling stopped i love this stuff ! ! ! give it a chance it works great	15
1	i purchased the tui shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean i wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day i love carol 's daughter and i am thankful for her products	15
1	i use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products having bleached hair i did n't think i 'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until i discovered these products they are worth their weight in gold ! they leave my hair soft manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful	15
1	i found iman lipsticks from the kits to be not as nice as the picture but the eyeshadows are very soft with high pigments in beautiful colors the pencils good quality and very versatile overall the kits are a great buy	15
1	i was so surprised by this eyeshadow i usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when i tested this on my hand i had to have it ! be mine is a light shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft smooth and lightweight that it glides on and does n't look cakey since i bought this i hardly wear any of the cheap stuff i own this is worth the price and now i'm saving up to buy a few more shades	15
1	i just love this product it takes away the dead skin on your face and leaves it sparkling clean there are little diamond flakes left as well you face looks radiant and young i will not be without this produc	15
1	worth every penny someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are the candles burn forever and really scent the place up but not in an ovepowering fake way i ca n't wait until they make body perfume in red currant all of them smell good however cheers from berkeley c	15
1	ive never liked spicy or musky scents but im in love with burberry brit its got a great musky overtone but its not too heavy like most fragrances like it the scent sticks around all day which is also a plus i 've a ways used light scents like romance by ralph lauren and ck one but burberry brit is easily my new favourite im actually here to buy my second bottle	15
1	this is alittle heavier than usual summer skin products ielight and non greasy but when you are maintaining your tan and or recovering from skin peeling this cream is rich and works great ! the ingredients are rich and they really make the skin feel smooth	15
1	this is a treat to wear i alternate it with my secret sparkling lily clear gel deodorant the fresh deodorant does n't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating it smells just like fresh 's sugar perfume sweet and lemony but does n't last as long that 's why i only gave it 4 stars it also does n't cake or pill up like other deodorants this is my favorite deodorant	15
1	this lip gloss is so wonderful i do n't know where to start long lasting shine perfect color goes on smooth does n't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do mild fruity flavor i highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone the expense is worth it 100x over	15
1	i have been using this mascara for years i have tried other brands drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else i have ever tried why \? this mascara is smooth it does not flake off and fall into your eyes it does not ever look clumpy it is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes i would not say that this mascara will make your lashes a mile long or dangerously thick or whatever hype you hear from other brands those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara just a simple nice natural looking mascara that wo n't irritate your eyes	15
1	i do n't remember when i first tried this product but now i 've been using it for years and i love it ! this is a great eye color base it goes on smoothly without rubbing or pulling the skin and provides a smooth base for powder eye color i wear it every day under my eye makeup it makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you 're wearing try it and you 'll love it too	15
1	in one month this product made my skin so smooth and refreshed that a facial scar from six years ago disappeared from my cheek	15
1	instant non greasy moisture for the tender eye area smooths out fine wrinkles	15
1	this product is great ! ! ! i wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when i put a drop or two on at bedtime one night i was really beat too beat to wash my face so i tried putting a little on over everything instead it worked great when i wear it at night my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like i'm 19 again ! \( i'm almost 40 ! \) i ca n't say that everyone will have the same results i do all i know is that i am very very happy to have found this product !	15
1	i hsve used clinique moisturing gel for years and this was the first time i had the pump what a thrill as only a little bit is extracted and that is all one needs	15
1	great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products this product should n't cost this much though it costs less at authorized bb retail outlets and buying bb products online does n't guarantee the consumer that they 're getting authentic bb so beware check out www bumbleandbumble com for authorized retailers	15
1	i love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness when wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses \( paper cups are the worst ! \) napkins and whoever you 've just buzzed found the answer to the stickies with chanel 's aqualumiere line the lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots it can be blotted and still shines as if that were n't enough it 's spf15 my favorite shade is macao a rosy pink	15
1	only drawback it stays wetter onyour face prior to shaving than the competitive stuffi e afta which dries quickly so youcan get to shaving quicker	15
1	i like this cologne although my wife uses it mostly the fragrance is incredible and from time to time i use it as an air freshner as well it is subtle yet long lasting and i may only recommend it	15
1	inis has a very fresh crisp clean scent that i love it 's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering which is what i like about it it 's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it whenever i wear it people always sniff and make comments like what are you wearing \? and mmm ! you smell so good	15
1	this is a really great scent but it could of been better i think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals i mean seriously animals want to smell nice too	15
1	inis has become my favourite perfume every time i wear it i am always being asked what perfume are you wearing \? it is light fresh fragrant not overpowering but makes an impression i have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to inis the fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive ca n't recommend it enough buy and try	15
1	got perfume for my wife she loves it me too of course	15
1	this is a great product but way too expensive on this site you can find it for 28 00	15
1	i 'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when i tried burberry brit 's eau de toilette one day i could n't believe how wonderful the scent was especially after it had been on for a while i splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time \( even with almost daily use it 's still mostly full \) i consider this to be my signature scent and get many compliments on it	15
1	i got this as a gift i had tested the eau de parfum version at a department store cosmetics' counter and was less than thrilled however the edt was just right for me ! i believe in signature fragrances so i 'll let this be the signature of one of my many moods	15
1	used the cleansing foam then bought the moisture cream whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin have stopped using my old department store stuff replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results good value on both they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too	15
1	i love the smell and i much prefer the solid perfume to the spray just subtle enough	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance when i put this on i get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours i put the spray cologne version of falling in love on top to brighten it up a bit when i feel like it it is subtle but i think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering definitely something my husband wants to be near	15
1	i was unsure about this item in the store but took a gamble i cut 1 3 of the bar up and crumbled it and i was n't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry so i grabbed the rest and tossed it all in wow ! it was so silky and smooth against the skin i jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me ! with some nice classical music on in the background and a tahitian vanilla candle you 'll think your back in the womb all safe and warm the bubbles did n't last very long but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent	15
1	my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid there 's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar i really like that it 's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar it 's great for those who do n't want a flowery bath but who ca n't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar i wish i 'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies plus this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb really probably any bomb would do good stuff	15
1	bubbles nicely but does not smell like hot milk i 've never tried milky bar so i have no idea if the two compare hot milk \? is comforting though its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer	15
1	this is the one for you i love love love lavender and this soap is it concentrated lavender goodness very dark purple in color and complex in scent layering wonderful light texture to soap	15
1	i bought this on a whim because i just remodeled my house after hurricane katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub nice to take long baths in so of course i needed some bubble stuff the bath bombs smell wonderful my whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until i used them all i even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful \( for about a week \) ! the bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve the fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day i loved them and will definitely buy more	15
1	forget all those other so called good colognes out there happy for men is the best smelling one of them all ! it may be expensive but it is well worth it example i sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request ! she requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart that is how good it is ! enjoy	15
1	for me happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth as with the signature female clinique scents you do n't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering subtle trail of sophistication	15
1	as we 've heard it 's not easy being green it 's more than easy it 's delightful if you 're an avobath bath ballistic infused with avocado \( hence the name \) and olive oil it moisturizes skin the fragrance is fresh rather citrusy thanks to lemongrass and rosewood bath water is a lovely shade of green rather like new spring grass if there 's glitter in it i did n't find any which was as i wished it 's suggested for morning i 'd relax with an avobath any time of day	15
1	i love the fresh scent of the avobath there 's just nothing like it it smells like springtime to me i have yet to notice any glitter in an avobath bath \( and i 've taken about 10 \) so if you 're glitter shy do n't let that stop you from trying this one	15
1	i like to eat avocados i like avocado face masks and now i can bathe in eau de avocado ! this bath bomb is possibly my favorite very softening great color \( turns your tub into a nice green lagoon \) and great lemony scent i did n't find the glitter to be very noticeable so do n't worry about that stock up on this one	15
1	kai is like lying in a meadow in the warmth of the sun with a gentle breeze and the aroma of a million sweet flowers embracing you oh how i love it	15
1	o k these glosses are just plain yummy ! actually they do n't taste like lipglosses at all which is a good thing no one wants waxy orchemical flavored gloss thatmakes you want to throw up right \? all the flavors are amazingly delicious each one tastes just like sweets the colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky they go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle i wish the tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky overall nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes	15
1	i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites it 's a pretty good deal at only 28 for so many colors i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket it 's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar themed cosmetic experience	15
1	i bought this cream after i tried about a dozen other brands and i loved it it a bit pricy but it worth every penny i am 24 so i bought it to smooth out starting lines that i had and prevent new ones it worked ! now i look like i am 20 again	15
1	was using philosophy 's various light scents discovered this burberry london sample in my last sephora shipment went to macy 's and bought the set for under 77 lotion shower gel and 3 3 oz fragrance fretted over price until i actually used the products layering them recieved so many compliments ! not an old lady 's perfume not strong nor weak it has an elegant floral fragrance top notes rose clementine and honeysuckle heart notes tiare flower jasmine and peony dry down notes sandalwood veil of musk and patchouli all my favorites	15
1	one of the best perfumes i have tried in a long time my boyfriend goes crazy over it	15
1	reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to especially if you 're not already using lush products it does n't 'sud up' much and feels a little bit muddy and grainy do n't fret though ! it will certainly clean your hair and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices \( almost as good as arabian bright \) the highlights are not something that come with one or two washings but with many many washings and they are very subtle but there the only reason i do n't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is and i needed to use another conditioning product with it	15
1	i bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands hydrated and soft after leaving them on for half an hour with the glamour gloves gel my hands felt reborn i could n't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated i 've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they 're still doing the job i 've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and do n't know how well they work but these are very high quality	15
1	i first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester i fell in love with the sweet sugary light smell of it and so did my husband it 's perfect for all seasons since it 's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you 're wearing i 've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet now i want to try some of their other fragrances if they are half as good as this they win in my book	15
1	this is the first bronzer i actually finished this gives the most natural finish and blends really well i like that it 's matte because i'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer ever since i started using this i'm just addicted and ca n't live without it it gives the skin a really natural healthy looking flush i 've got medium olive skin and i use light my skin does n't look orangey or dirty try it and i'm sure you 'll like it make sure you use a really good brush	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
1	this mattifying moisturizer is great ! it definitely helps with my oily skin and works all day long i ca n't say more than enough positive effects this moisturizer has had on m	15
1	i am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time i would order it again	15
1	this foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look while also giving a good coverage i 've been using this foundation for years all year long and it is one of my favorites not too heavy and not too light it 's the perfect foundation being asian american and with a light complexion finding a good color match had always been a problem unless i spent 40 for a bottle of makeup zhen is one of the best deals around clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside	15
1	this product is truly amazing ! the application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you will have long long lashes my lashes are medium length but when i use this people who know me thing i am wearing falsies this stuff rocks ! i 've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does	15
1	i had an amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on it so happened that i needed new tweezers i read the reviews and thought i 'd give these a try wow i ca n't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers i have ever owned they almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp it is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair tweezerman tweezers rock !	15
1	i'm sure that you do n't need any more assurance but just to let you know i 've had my tweezerman 's for over 5 years now they are still sharp ! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably would n't be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have	15
1	i purchased this one month ago and i will never use anything else blends wonderfully great colors i bought it for my daughter from amazon sephora as well great product	15
1	these are great for removing excess oil when you ca n't stop and wash your face or do n't want to disturb your makeup i prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half dollar like the rest of them	15
1	i have been wearing obsession since 1986 and it has definitely not gone out of style every day i get a comment from someone about how good i smell my boss even bought some obsession for his wife because he likes it so much on me this is my favorite perfume	15
1	i'm a cologne junkie and of my vast collection armani mania is clearly my 1 i'm into my 3rd bottle of this potion and it continues to bring on the compliments and inquiries of what 's that cologne you 're wearing it smells fantastic ! you cannot repeat cannot go wrong here a modern classic	15
1	this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set i have used i have very fine very straight and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner this set makes it smooth but not oily and so when i brush my hair there is no yanking going on my hair is noticeably more shiny and soft it has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural what a great way to pamper yourself ! definitely worth the extra investment	15
1	i was a bit apprehensive to purchase a candle this expensive but i was very pleased with the scent clean burning and look of the candle and the packaging it came in the havana is a scent that both my husband and i enjoyed	15
1	the cream is great it instantly gets absorbed after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries \( which causes black circle appearences \) i suffered from chronic dark circles this cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness i would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me i still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes but never the less i find it effective	15
1	have had dark circles caused by pigmentation for four years and have tried everything have been using hylexin for just five days and honestly its been amazing i saw all the bad reviews and im glad they didnt stop me for the first time in years i dont need a concealer will continue to keep you posted as i hope in the nxt week or two not to have any circles at all \( if it continues this way \) i think mayb the product doesnt work for hereditery circles	15
1	i love how this product works and feels on my skin ! ! does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out ! makes skin feel cool and clean ! ! i have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out or be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin but that was n't the case my skin did n't break out nor is this product drying highly recommend !	15
1	i used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones i was impressed with the results it leaft my hair with much needed moisture and very shiny i normally apply the realxer myself at home but i choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states the smell was not noticeable which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong it did n't burn my scalp like most have the quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give i think that it was worth the price ! i 'll be buying it again	15
1	this is not sticky lip gloss the rose tone is easy to wear it's sweet and natural tone you can mix colors and than create new color on your lips ! ! you don't need to shop tons of glosses and lip sticks this is it ! plus the palette case is cute	15
1	i love this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down i did get a good deal at my salon 9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner	15
1	to tell you the truth i have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz nothing really worked at all but biosilk is a miracle ! the first time i tried it i noticed a major difference in my hair just add a little bit to your hair and it will immediately smooth it out adding shine and softness it will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy just do n't use that much of it i mostly use this with my flat iron and i get amazing results i happen to like the smell of it it reminds me of being in a salon ! try the shampoo and conditioner as well	15
1	i have wavy and coarse hair and i have a whole lot of it i use this product after shower on damp hair and then blow dry this product really works and makes my hair soft and silky and it gives the hair nice movement and makes it easy to style my hairdresser who has similiar hair as mine recommended me this product and she said she loves it i am very happy to find this product before wasting a lot of money on trying others that do n't work it is a bliss	15
1	my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i 've used it ever since it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good just a little of biosilk goes a long way gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair i definitely reccomend it	15
1	i was hooked on sebastian 's shine serum forever then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product it has a nice soft finish so if you like sebastian and redkin 's shine serums you 'll like this i'm not going to go as far as to say it 's a miracle worker it makes your hair shinier it helps a little with my frizz but does n't depouf	15
1	i have straight hair but it is super long and thick past my waist so i have problems combing it and keeping it smooth biosilk is the best stuff i have found to detangle after washing and keep my hair soft after it is dry i have tried everything else and i mean everything and nothing compares i'm so hooked i have bought it by the gallon and believe me that is not cheap ! it even smells great it 's not greasy and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages too	15
1	this is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there it is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy i put some on before i walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as i apply it regularly love it !	15
1	i really like this mascara i only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and i have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out otherwise it is the only mascara that does n't cause me to loose a ton of lashes everything else from estee lauder bourjois to great lash causes me loose a lot of lashes i also like that if i cry i do n't wind up looking like a raccoon it subtly melts away no mess ! it washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible not flaky	15
1	this mascara is great i 've tried many and this is the only one that does n't smudge all over the place the only drawback is the price it 's triple what drugstore brands cost	15
1	follow the cleanser with the komenuka bijin skin lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of sake in fact this cleansing toner does contain sake along with rice bran seaweed aloe yeast glycyrrhizate orange lemon matricaria algae luffa cylindrica and fountain water the toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion the rebecca review	15
1	this salve is just perfect under bliss 's softening socks it 's amazing how much you can smear on leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks it leaves feet renewed use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies	15
1	this is for sure one of my new favorite sets the scent is nice and clean the lotion and gel left a very nice scent also	15
1	i bought this perfume for my husband and both of us love it very sexy and yet a clean scent at the same time it 's light enough to be perfect for the man who normally does n't wear perfumes yet elegant enough for the man who does	15
1	this razor rocks the proper technique is easy to learn short light strokes down then up \( if you want a closer shave \) this gives me hardly any nicks compared to the gillette mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the shick quattro the sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since dec 2006 typical razor cartridges would n't even come close to that longevity and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement merkur blades which are 50 cents each i am just doing facial shaving with it at this point hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving i expect i 'll be using merkur for the rest of my life	15
1	i'm a first time de shaver and this razor is great my grandfather used these types of razors and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a mach iii only advice is try a couple different blades depending on your skin type beard you 'll need a different type of blade one blade does n't fit all and always remember this is n't the mach iii do n't apply pressure	15
1	this razor returns one to an augustinian sense of progress and history it is similar to what my grandfather used to shave with and is simply the best way to shave so long as you have a decent brush and soap at hand	15
1	this conditioner leaves hair ultra soft and does n't weigh it down if you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair this one wo n't the ingredients contain rosemary infusion lavender flower infusion seaweed and fresh lemon juice the lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue it 's a great conditioner	15
1	i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho hum scent this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product	15
1	this is my favorite scent from philosophy it is clean and crisp never over done	15
1	i purchased this pumice stone to help remove the dried skin on my feet and ankles that appears as you get older it does a good job and comes in its own small case i use it frequently and find that i have much less dry skin in that area now	15
1	you use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face you then put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard after using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam after a quick rinse my skin looked less dull and helped clear blotches 4 stars because i ran out of the cream and still have some unused gel capsules	15
1	i really like this peel it is very easy to use and i have noticed a difference in my skin it is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading i even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing i recommend this peel to anyone i have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation i use this one about twice a week i also recommend the microdelivery vitamin c peel that one i use once a week jennife	15
1	i wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that i have are horrificly sticky and if they are n't sticky they do not stay on for long this one however manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick the color \( apple a day \) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and does n't go anywhere it also has no stickyness ! yay ! i love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs !	15
1	the first time i smelled this intoxicating scent i knew i had to have it for myself it 's heady rich very exotic dark and mysterious when i wear this perfume i envision a room filled with beautiful brown skinned women with dark black hair and richly colored silks of red and purple covering their bodies laying around on organza and brocade covered chaises eating sweet dark fruit and sipping red wine from cobalt glasses	15
1	though i have never traveled the world this perfume allowsme to feel like a veteran globe trotter it is sophisticatedwithout being obnoxious i genuinely feel like a woman ofintrigue and experience though fanciful it is fun for ahomegrown rose	15
1	caleche is an absolute classic i'm often stopped and asked what i'm wearing pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same \( like chemicals \) caleche is the real thing and the soie de parfum lasts make sure when purchasing that you do n't accidentally buy caleche eau delicate it 's a completely different frangrance guaranteed to make you gag why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances \( miracle happy pleasures poison \) \? once you try caleche you 'll no longer look for anything else i highly recommend the lotion and shower gel too	15
1	i love get fresh products especially the lemongrass lavendar scent i use the hand sugar scrub \( which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands \) it is very light and pleasant as are the others i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these great gift the hatbox design is very cute	15
1	ooohh sparklies ! ! ! ! ! you can put this on your face make you very much pretty turn the heads of boy types stops traffic ! !	15
1	i 've never smelled anything like this if you 've ever been to the mediterranean coast you will be instantly transported by this scent it goes on strong lasts long and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air but not the yankee candle ocean water type scent this is the real thing like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you ! rejoice all women who are tired of sugary syrupy womens' perfume ! this is it	15
1	an awesome product that sells out and that 's the only problem ! i had to call around the us to find it in a department store in stock and that would ship amazon 's supplier was sold out	15
1	proraso shave cream is the best bang for the buck in hi end non drugstore shave creams i 've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso the texture consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate and you do n't need a badger hair brush ! i initially missed using a brush at first but do n't miss all the product i wasted that were left behind in the bristles couple proraso with a good safety razor \( may i suggest merkur \) and you 'll get a shave that trounces anything a mach iii can throw at you trust me	15
1	bravo pronto pregovery nice product great shave and the eucalyptus is divine	15
1	this is a nice smell that turns babypowderish on me my fiancee luvs it he is also a huge fan of chanel no	15
1	as a dentist i am in very close physical contact with my patients this is the only fragrance i wear because it is light yet feminine and does not bother my patients i receive so many compliments every time i wear it	15
1	i typically do n't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner ! my husband bought this one for me for christmas i 'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled what a great guy ! i could n't have been happier with this gift i love this scent clean and fresh you can wear this scent day or night not heavy or overwhelming the unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too highly recommend beyond paradise	15
1	beyond paradise is a wonderful flirty floral scent that is n't too overpowering i recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine	15
1	i bought this last month in purple looks awesome and it does n't hurt when you put it on best of all it stays on and if you set it it will stay all day	15
1	this lip gloss is super ! ! ! not only does it glide on your lips it has staying power the colors are so subtle and pretty it is worth every penney and i will not waste my money on cheaper sticky and short lived lip glosses	15
1	almost every time i wear curve i get comments from the ladies a very good thing i currently have 10 different types of cologne and i wear this one a lot it seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it	15
1	these are absolutely the best they get every hair easily the points are soo sharp these are worth the money trust me id recommend to anyon	15
1	i have an oily t zone or i should say had i started using this product because i was breaking out a lot due to the extra oil my skin was producing to keep my face moisturized not only has my face cleared up but it has a nice healthy shine to it all day no makeup necessary	15
1	this product is worth the price ! i use it every day especially my whole eye area and i love it ! it does not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy either	15
1	murad promises the miracle cure for acne while the product is good it 's not a miracle i 've been usines murad for two months and while my skin has improved it 's not flawless i still get break outs and they still take a while to heal i 'll keep using it because it 's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows maybe my skin will improve	15
1	this is my favorite soap in the world a new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks and the scent lingers on my skin as well the soap is gentle and long lasting i recommend it highly	15
1	naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it lucky for me i like ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby 's butt' \? erm no \? easy simple to use obviously no messing with jars or bottles just go to town massaging those pesky areas i'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise	15
1	i am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away the nice thing is you do n't need to douse yourself with it to get the effect my mother who is 75 never mentions my perfume noticed it right away and kept asking me about it i just ordered her some for her birthday	15
1	this body butter is yummy it smells good it feels good on it is a must for dry skin	15
1	the smell is great the feel on the skin is great ! just like the other reviews suggest !	15
1	this is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer \( hence demon in the dark \) before you put this in the shower cut off the wax then enjoy the tingling soap very invigorating	15
1	i purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products when we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box when we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink he used it and i was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to bring it	15
1	best face cream ever but even though cosmetic mall com had it for less the three week shipping and poor service from usps from china i 'll pay the extra buck and get it from nordstom again next time	15
1	fahrenheit by dior has a fragrance like no other i 've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since i can remember it is bold and fragrant generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it it seems a little overpowering at first but as i said you either like it or hate it the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it 's not something that i 'd use in summer essentially a night fragrance	15
1	lancome 's juicy tubes in simmer tastes like my beverage of choice orange julius when you apply it it feels like you 're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips \( minus the cold minus the cream \) the color is a very subtle pink ish beige but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a simmer ! this is my 4th tube of juicy \( also a big fan of spring fling berry bold \) and so far this is my favorite flavor	15
1	i used to use mac 's glass lipgloss before juicy tubes were around any time the wind blew i had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which as you know is extremely unpleasant and annoying juicy tubes stays on but does n't have the overly sticky feeling which is wonderful i do n't wear much makeup and find juicy tubes to add that something special to a dewy face i recommend daiquiri or berry bold for the most natural looks daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while berry bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally you will adore this gloss i ca n't live without it	15
1	oh my gosh ! i love this lip gloss so much i first bought one last year and it was the best item of makeup i 've ever bought ! it goes great over other lip gloss lipstick or alone all of the colors are great but i 'd start our with pink first my personal favorite is spring fling because it 's not so bright but it 's still juicy you will deffinetly not regret buying one of these it 's worth every penny	15
1	this nail polish is by far the best nail product i have ever purchased ! i stumbled accross it in france two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since the brush is great depositing the polish smoothly and thinly the product dries quickly and lasts a long time it is amazing	15
1	i have been using this product religiously since i gave birth in february unfortunately i have not noticed a difference i mean no change at all	15
1	my boyfriend has this cologne and i love it ! it smells so good even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne it smells as if he was it may be a little on the expensive side \( not as expensive on amazon com as macy 's or other department stores \) but it 's well worth it just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
1	after hearing so many good things about philosophy 's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it wo n't last long on your body after taking a shower i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed overall a great product	15
1	i put this in a bathroom soap dispenser for christmas and it adds a nice touch during the holiday season smells nice and lathers well	15
1	i am a huge fan of the creme but not of this lip balm for the price they want this should 've been much much better it goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok my l'occitane lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does save your money and do not buy this	15
1	i have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping and this is it it 's absolutely amazing better than anything i have tried and i have tried so many lip products the lemon custard flavor is delicious too put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth this is the ultimate conditioner for your lips	15
1	i first got a whiff of blue in a magazine advertisement when it came out and it was love from that moment i went out and purchased it and this is all i wear now it is all i want to wear nothing else compares to this for me i get so many compliments ! i had one coworker once who would walk by me just so he could smell it he told me what he was doing of course he just loved the smell people want to know what i am wearing and where they can purchase it i feel great when i'm wearing it and i will keep using it as long as they will make it	15
1	this is by far the most delicious scent ever no other perfume comes even close i use it everyday and it is worth every cent	15
1	definitely a must have perfume ! the smell is just awesome not too strong not too mild and stays for long i strongly recommend this it is also a great gift	15
1	a great product for dry skin without leaving a greasy feeling not only does it make my skin feel soft but it smells wonderful	15
1	i've seen carol's daughter advertised in countless magazines i've also seen it on tyra's talk show and after hearing so many wonderful things about her company i've been dying to see how good it is for myself well today i received my carol's daughter products and i am throughly pleased ! ! ! this almond cookie fragrance smells so delicious ! ! ! i love how it feels on my skin ! ! ! finally a product that works as good as it smells ! ! !	15
1	i absolutly love all of carol 's daughter 's products everything to me is true to description i recieved my almond cookie gift set in the mail and i couldnt wait to open it the smell is to die for sometimes i open my shea souffle' just so i can smell it i also love her labels and containers i will forever be a customer of carol 's daughter and i look forward to the day where i can walk into one of her stores her prices are worth every dime remember you get what you pay for	15
1	i thank god for carol 's daughter i have finally found a quality product that makes me feel like i'm at the spa in my own home for a a resonable price i rather pay 25 00 any day for spectacular service and a fantastic product any day than 10 so so product filled with water and vaseline i am a carols daughter member so are my kids and most of my family kudos to lisa price for setting that much needed standard in the beauty industry god bless you al	15
1	this product is very well built the mirrors are clear and free from any distortion magnification level is just right the only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable	15
1	the mirror was very easy to install after using the mirror a couple weeks the plane and magnifying mirrors are very clear and easy to adjust to the correct distance for great viewing the only negative is that the halo light does not provide sufficient brightness but not an issue if mirror is used in a well lighted area	15
1	was very happy with the service of delivery and i use the mirror every day	15
1	i love this product i use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so i pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick i have various mustela products and they all work great	15
1	this is a fabulous product i use the whole mustela line this is great for sponge bathing when your newborn arrives home i also use it on a cotton ball after baths to make sure my baby is extra clean this is great for helping babies complexion	15
1	i love this product ! i look forward to the end of the day knowing that i can soothe my tired feet with fair trade foot lotion ! i 've seen this product work wonders prior to this purchase when my husband was in the army his feet were extremley worn and torn when he came home from iraq after using this product for several days his feet looked and felt brand new	15
1	i actually got a sample from the lush store in san francisco and just tried it it 's fabulous on my cracked and peeling heels	15
1	this is my all time favorite perfume bar none ! i get millions of compliments when i wear it most people think it smells like baking cookies or marshmallows but not a little girl scent definitely a grown up girl scent men love it because it smells like food a definite turn on ! lol \) you truly cannot go wrong with this perfume it is absolutely faboo	15
1	this is a great finisher use after you 've drenched your hair with leave in conditioner and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape smells great but does n't compete with the smell of other products only con a little bit does not go a long way it 's expensive to stock up	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15

1	i'm really anal about scented flavored lipglosses especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass is n't that vanilla ish at all ! it 's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time do n't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off	15
1	i reach for ck one on days that i want a crisp fresh scent intended to be a unisex fragrance it is not at all sweet or flowery however it does have a softness to it that i personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man i find it to be slightly musky without being masculine overall this is a really nice neutral fragrance for everyday wear	15
1	ck1 is a very nice toilette spray it has a very good smell to it i gave it as a gift and now i am going to have to purchase it for me to	15
1	i love this perfume it 's the best that i have in my collection it 's not too strong but it 's enough for everyone to notice i practically wear it everyday and this size will usually last for a while	15
1	this is an amazingly fresh fragrance it 's a light lush and sparkling floral fruity blend a lot of people asked me what i was wearing i highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice scent that they can wear all day	15
1	i use both this mascara and lancome flextencils when i'm going out flextencils first then coat with hypnose my lashes look huge and not too clumpy flextencils add great length while hypnose adds volume i use hypnose by itself on just an average day great product ! makes my lashes big and not clump	15
1	i 've always used lancome mascaras before hypnose i used denfincils hypnose is a great mascara never clumps the non waterproof version is easily removable and your lashes look amazing definately give this product a try	15
1	so far this is the best thickening mascara i have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores it is not sticky or gloppy and you wo n't look like tammy fay with spider lashes i do however have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes but i have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras my journey ends here	15
1	this bath melt was nice it smelled great but it is pretty sweet it did n't do anything spectacular to the water just kind of made it look soapy the melt took it 's time melting and the smell lasted throughout the bath i took the melt after it sat in the water for a while and rubbed it directly on my skin which made my skin smell nice it also moisturizes well and makes the water feel smooth and silky but the smell did n't linger on my skin once i was out of the water	15
1	if you have n't tried lush or creamy candy do it ! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft for soap to match try rock star mmmmm ! ! ! i ca n't place the fragrance it 's cherry but not cotton candy but not it 's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts enjoy	15
1	this is the best micro peel i have ever tried ! the thing i noticed first was that when i applied when hope is not enough and the present they went on so smoothly they absorbed equally in my mid 30 's my young skin is fading but this really brought it back i wo n't say i am 19 again but i am sure the difference is obvious i am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since i added this to my bag of tricks it is a lot more effective that i would have thought and i have not had a microdermabrasion since i started using this 2 4 times per month	15
1	i love love this product i ca n't believe how much i actually used it i ran out of my box within two months ! all those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder this kept my straps in place all day and night ! a few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom i use the strips to close the flap in place so it 's smooth all the way down tip in some cases i cut the strips in half even half a strip holds my bra straps in place this product holds things in place or down it does not lift and hold its not ducked tape	15
1	the powder foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large pored it is one of the best around for no caking no oil smooth surface skin if you ca n't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations chanel does it best ! ! also my seller was terrific	15
1	i love this foundation it is a easy one step process i do n't like to use liquid i need something easy quick and foolproof i am always in a hurry with 3 kids i do n't have time for multi steps i also have acne and red cheeks this evens out my skin and covers my acne my skin looks flawless i have tried so many products including mac bare minerals lancome origins shiseido etc my only problem with this makeup is it is so expensive what do you expect it 's chanel pure perfection	15
1	i absolutely love this kit it keeps my dry slightly acne prone skin so soft smooth blemish free \( for the most part \) i use both everyday along with an intense moisturizer my complexion has improved greatly	15
1	i absolutely love this kit i love that i can use the great mystery every morning and it is n't harsh on my skin and i love using the greatest love at night and when i wash it off it just melts into my skin i do n't even have to put on a moisturizer for something really nice try using the great mystery and then put the greatest love on top of that it 's really amazing the only caution i would have is when using the greatest love do n't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn	15
1	i suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face the infection left scars on half of my face i started using the exfoliate kit regularly after four months my face now looks normal and i'm able to go without makeup again thanks philosophy	15
1	best skin care line i have ever used frequent air travel wrecked havoc on my skin and the exfoliate kit revealed a complexion i never knew i had i'm currently using other philosophy products and have recommended them to family and friends	15
1	this is a great prodduct at a reasonable price whenever i need these i order and the arrive timel	15
1	i absolutely adore this scent ! it certainly is not just for men ! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this ! the sea salt is amazing ! i literally have n't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person ! never again ! give it a try ! it 'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high	15
1	this is such a nice lightweight conditioner and makes my hair smell super clean and fresh	15
1	i have been using this product for years i have a really oily t zone and i find that this product keeps it in control it is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin no matter what color your skin tone may be i think you will like this product !	15
1	product works well it 's a whole lot better than using your fingers	15
1	this product is absolutely brilliant in the past i have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out taking too long plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on with these powder papers i can do it anytime discreetly without having to use a mirror or a puff just a fresher face with a slight dusting of powder perfect	15
1	terrific for the area around the eyes gets rid of dryness and does n't sting the eyes or feel greasy	15
1	this cream cleanser is wonderful ! i have used the clinique 3 step program since i was a teenager until i went to an at home body shop party and tried this cleanser i have been using it ever since it is so soft and creamy feels great going on my skin and leaves it feeling clean smooth and moisturized its great at gently removing make up in the evenings and is a nice pick me up first thing in the mornings	15
1	this is a very suttle fragrance that lasts for hours slightly floral however is a very intimate scent most people need to get very close to notice which can be good but also a sign that you need to spray yourself all over i would recommend picking this up if you want something to carry around in your purse to spray here and there it last for hours but is not an all day perfume	15
1	i bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate i was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but i was not dissapointed this perfume is absolutely fabulous ! when you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes the middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy and the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping buy this perfume you will fall in love with it	15
1	i love this perfume it has been my signature everyday scent for several years now alot of people ask what you are wearing because it smells so good and guys love it too	15
1	of all the higher end mascaras i 've tried this one is by far the best your lashes look longer and thicker with just one coat and looks like natural great lashes not made up the creamy gel formula goes on smooth never clumps or feels sticky and true to form your lashes will curl up nicely although not a water proof mascara it has incredible staying power cleans off easily i love this mascara wo n't look elsewhere	15
1	i have this product working in my hair right now it is simply wonderful ! first off it smells like lovely victorian rosebud almond pudding it has a similar consistency i can get about three to four uses from each container and i have very thick hair my hair was preciously quite dry and abused i had dyed it twice in the last six months after one use of this product my hair felt better than it had in years silky strong and shiny i love this product ! i highly recommend it	15
1	i love this product my eye brows are growing but not all over in the areas where i'm putting the product the hair has become darker but nothing extreme just in a way where i'm able to see it now \( i'm naturally a toehead \) i would recommend this to others but i'm saddened that it 's so hard to find and i was unable to do so in a store	15
1	i love this shampoo my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he does \) anyway it smells amazing and really works well with my unruly hair	15
1	i am a fan of ralph lauren and check new products from this brand i liked this scent although i am probably more used to polo blue which is also great it is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews anyway it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for st valentine 's day	15
1	at first spray this can be a pretty potent cologne but after 1 2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it 's green original polo brother lasts all day long and into the night worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto or lighter scented cologne	15
1	this has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market pricy yes but well worth every cent in as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole tastes as good as it smells lemon brownsugar like the body scrub of the same name my only complaint it does n't have the longevity of say prada 's lip balm \( which i use when running \)	15
1	i love these inserts ! i had trouble finding ones this size not too big not too small they definitely help me to fill out my bras ! i would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts i tried just setting these in my bra but if i moved my arms up and my bra moved around i was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out these are a great product though	15
1	but it definitally did not work as it was intended it is intended to moisturize hair i have long fine oily hair and i received trichomania as a gift i love the smell but when i first used it it left my hair very dry which i consider a good thing considering the state of my hair it just didnt do what it was supposed to however if you have really oily hair this is the thing for you no problems with lathering either especally if you rub the bar in your hair not in your hands doesnt leave white flakes either	15
1	if you have dry hair trichomania is for you it smells like real coconuts not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions and works wonders on my dry colored and generally abused hair plus it lasts forever all of lush 's solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones they do take some getting used to but once you adjust everything else will smell so chemical and you 'll wonder why you ever used them	15
1	i 've tried several eye shaddow bases including laura mercier and find the laura geller eye spackle to last the longest i generally have my makeup on by 6 00am and keep in on until 9 30 pm it looks as great at night as it did in the morning i definitely recommend this product	15
1	this is the best perfume that i have ever used i tried estee lauder lancome and i always come back to paloma the scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time buy it today	15
1	works exceptionally well clears pimple faster than other types of treatments i have used and reduces the redness very quickly my 2 teenage daughters love the product as well because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time will definitely buy it again !	15
1	murad acne spot treatment really works to drive away those unsightly blemishes ! it heals even the big nasty pimples in a few days with the smaller ones healing in hours it really does help to minimize the appearance of most acne after i apply it too overall i would say it is a great produce for anyone who like me considers even minor acne to be a major annoyance	15
1	i love this portable perfume it 's really sleek and easy to carry around to reapply the smell is delicious and it leaves a nice shimmery sheen on your skin	15
1	i have very fine hair and this is one products that thickens without weighing the hair down it leaves hair soft not stiff yet easy to style and keep the hold	15
1	i have this lip gloss in sweetie and will be trying other shades i am very pleased with it ! i wear it over stay on type lip colors in other brands and it keeps my color on all day \( even after eating \) ! it does n't really feel too sticky if you blot after application i only wish it tasted as good as it smells \( not that it tastes bad it 's just blah \) !	15
1	i love this lip gloss the cake batter taste smell is totally addictive the colors are lacking though all of the colors are light very sheer shades i bought the color babydoll which is a light pink it goes on sheer and i love the smooth texture too this product is supposed to have glitter in it but i didnt' notice any and or its not too glaring which makes it fine for me to wear it at work	15
1	i am a true believer in the phrase if it is not broke dont fix it its hard to improve on perfection keep up the good work until next time ! mike michalsk	15
1	these bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength however since i only use this as a back scrub brush the detachable design is not optimal for me after a few months the brush handle attachment point became compromised \( probably from all the exposure to water \) and i found that the brush would often detach from the handle as i scrubbed my back at this point many more months down the road the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all so i am looking for a \( non detachable \) replacement even so i recommend this product because of it 's great bristles and also because the handle was great while it lasted	15
1	the tounge and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower \( dont have my glasses on \) the detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin the strap on the brush is cotton so this probably is n't a once in a lifetime purchase but very good for the price everybody needs one	15
1	the wipes work well they do not irritate my daughter 's face but they stink ! ! ! ! ! i usually use them before she goes to bed so that i do n't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous	15
1	great iron and its purple ! heats up fast stays hot variable hotness levels great i own this and the next size up and love them both	15
1	this is the only fragrance i have found that truly smells tropical this is my boyfriends favorite scent and he thinks all perfumes stink the four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry you have to wait awhile before you get dressed but it smells great	15
1	this is very good soap however it 's too expensive to buy on a regular basis unless you are rich very good quality though and i would buy it again if i had some money	15
1	although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment i used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel only drawback is the price and the container which you have to be very careful with in the shower ! but all in all it 's a wonderful product for fine hair and i 've come back to it again and again !	15
1	i 've been using this kit for several weeks now and i am absolutely amazed at the results ! i 've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill i was taking they were bright red and no concealer on the market would cover them after one week of using murad i 've noticed the scars fading ! i thought nothing on this planet would fade them but murad is ! i 've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin murad drastically reduces the amount of shine i have i highly recommend this product to everyone	15
1	this product made my skin look absolutely great ! i use it twice a day and within one week i saw a huge difference i 've been now using murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing i get compliments on my skin every day i highly recommend it	15
1	i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you	15
1	i love this product it takes only a few drops to make my hair shine it is light smells quite nice and is not at all overpowering or strong smelling i do n't buy cheap fragrances so i do n't know what bad perfumes reviewer nycoleb is comparing this with i suppose everyone 's body chemistry is different i have n't found any other product that does what this does so i 'll be buying another bottle when this one is done	15
1	i was amazed by the quality of this product when i first purchased it in the summer of 2006 it gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that i have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that i have not seen in years ! tui hair oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two or even longer if you wish	15
0	i suppose it 's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal manipulative mothers	16
0	the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that 's pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could 've been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i ca n't really think who might like it	16
0	horror movies are a dime a dozen now and nothing really speical about them anymore sad to say considering its probably my faviorte genere this movie was a disappointment from the start whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired i mean they are standing there talking and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen i didnt watch the whole movie it sucked that bad i bought this movie used and i 'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge	16
0	i was watching cinemax one night bored out of my mind and unable to sleep when this movie came on the acting made me laugh the premise made me laugh everything about it made me laugh hey at least it was fun to make fun of anyway just kinda mad that i wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap	16
0	incredible i saw one review describing this production the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible it is slow convoluted and uninspired no chemistry exists between the actresses with no connection to the audience	16
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	16
0	this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it	16
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	16
0	they suck ! bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established chapelle humor it was like watching mind of mencia two thumbs down leave this one alone tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though	16
0	the quality of the dvd 's was good however i did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons it seemed that the story was setting up for season 4	16
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	16
0	i often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews 5 stars are really paid biased professionals pumping up the movie for increased dvd sales	16
0	cheesy instructorthe instructor 's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves the instructor is too fast to follow to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone totally not professional	16
0	this was a hugely disappointing film i did not see it on stage nor do i want to if it is ever resurrected it trivializes illness death god heaven range of human emotion and love in all forms i have grown up in a post aids world and can see so many problems far worse than aids i am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits while america focuses on such banal subject matter larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality	16
0	the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)	16

0	i want the two hours of my life back ! after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973 that time is past \( even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new \) now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated !	16
0	i only bought this one for the song by jerry orbach the first 2 dvds were better	16
0	this product was a bad choice for me it was a poorly done product it was washed out the quality both audio and video was terrible it was not enjoyable to watch the packaging was cheap quality i should have known better pay more and get a nice set and a better product do n't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy paper sleeves make for a cheap copy	16
0	i was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs it covers several different styles of training clicker and others i would highly recommend it as a excellent resource in your inventory of training methods i am using it on my 9 week old rat terrier and he will fetch come sit and down with a little help and yes even shake hands	16
0	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	16
0	this movie is a disaster there is not one single memorable performance by the cast of stars if you want to see a little boy happily running to school get hit by a car walk home injured and die have at it there is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by amazon criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it they should be is ashame	16
0	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	16
0	i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you 're thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate \( which is why i gave it 1 star instead of 0 \) however if you 're still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it	16
0	someone wanted to make indiana jones part 4 starring tom hanks and created a such puzzled labyrinth that i think the book author would n't be able to tell the whole story without looking into his notes after watching this movie it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that you have vaisted 2 hours on nonsense 5 stars for special effects	16
0	the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie	16
0	the depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned from the moment they reached king kong 's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience i felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape how can anyone feel anything for king kong \? he keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island forces them to provide him sacrificial women and tortures the female star of the movie it seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking king kong the villains of the movie were my heroes i kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end	16
0	i have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the kids channels i was hoping the dvd would show each of his songs as they are performed on tv instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons this would have been a better cd instead of a dv	16
0	the story here dose n't matter the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction meth quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless roberts is so gay you want to smack his face he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius a role he plays better than anyone today in film br	16
0	i saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine i was strongly mistaken johnny depp is a great actor with great abilites but this is the worst movie of his i have ever seen even his cheesy movies were better than this the rated r rating is light i could n't believe how pornographic it was even in quills it was n't as raunchy as this do n't waste your money or your time with this one	16
0	the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something	16
0	i was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between the gospel and the fighting temptations i would not recommend purchasing you are better off renting	16

0	most people ca n't get enough of this movie i even own it on laserdisc when i saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on dvd i had to have it i am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality it lookslike there was just a transfer from vhs to dvd there does n't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality i recently saw it on hdnet movies and thought it looked much better do buy this movie because it is an all time classic do n't buy this movie if you think that the 20th anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	16
0	the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where 's the widescreen \? todays consumers are more educated \( thank god \) and they 've almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie \? ! they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd \? it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who 's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it \? buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible	16
0	fellini brings light on space instead of space on light he brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism he brings boredom and rattling to a new height lots of nice emotionalism and sweat waging tongues and blood candles and tits bondage and perversion we learn italian words that we can not use here is a good tidbit child of aphrodite and hermes hermaphrodite the subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments even in italian the voices do not match the sound one of the roman dudes encolpio \( martin potter \) finally got a real part as doctor who in1983	16
0	i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie	16
0	i liked this workout the first time i bought it as her fatburning workout the second time i bought it re packaged i thought it was a fluke this time i bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training so it must be different nope i have 5 kathy smith videos all three with different titles and covers only three different contents i feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company one month later and i have yet to receive a response	16
0	statutory rape is not funny ! neither is bad acting or pretentious scripts ! \( well okay they are but unintentionally \) would have been sexy and funny if oscar was 18 oscar was not a pretentious ass oscar 's stepmom was lena olin and oscar was played by topher grace gawd ! why ca n't i get paid to churn out mindless crap like this \? \? \? yes i could do this movie better i would dump the steady cam for starters aaah ! end pretentious crap movies ! just say no	16

0	seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those `experts' whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all \? besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs	16
0	this is an excellent story well told in script and action however it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends	16
0	who would give the green light to this \? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one	16
0	i loved these guys as a kid this collection sucks ! ! ! do n't buy it ! the first 3 dvd 's are silent and the 5th dvd is a reunion show the grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4 take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually if i could get my money back i would run to the nearest post office and return this item asap ! !	16
0	well i wrote the review about this set and boy was i disappointed when i got it i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse come on guys at least try to put some effort into it ! ! ! i got the set watched it lt and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use what a waste of money ! !	16

0	the quot latin quot moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves but if you 're interested in latin dance my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead this workout just is n't as energetic and fast paced as it looks	16
0	personally i found 8 1 2 to be one of the most boring films i 've ever seen it was a pretentious self indulgent trip down the director 's memory lane i understood the plot and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end but overall was bored silly by stilted pointless dialogue having said that the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching perhaps 8 1 2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment p	16
0	this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film and has many flaws a silly plot cheap religious imagery \( dracula is judas jeez louise \) and not one truly sexy or scary moment and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula 's brides including jennifer esposito jeri ryan if you ca n't make a film sexy with these two you 're in the wrong business craven has an over inflated rep as a director he does n't deserve any rep as a producer if this leaden film is a sample it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison save your money and pick up something scary instead like bava 's black sunday or any hammer horror	16
0	oliver stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a historian platoon and born on the fourth of july were great films but jfk though brilliantly made was a sign that something was off about stone 's mental processes natural born killers could have been a scathing indictment of our media 's obsession with violence and decadence but instead it 's just exhibit a in the indictment wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize	16

0	i agree with the negative comments i eventually stopped watching it unconvincing acting \( and a small point that i found irritating in tv movies about war some of them have a too clean look that make a film seem unrealistic there is no dirt anywhere as far as i could see everybody looks too clean the settings look too clean and not realistic the acting level was what finally turned me off glad it was on tv	16

0	i bought three dvds \( the wood was one of them \) and the dvds were in european codes which means they wo n't play in the united states unless you own a special dvd player i'm very unhappy with my purchase my recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country this is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices	16
0	this was a film i was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects as far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment the acting was good but robin williams did not receive as much screen time as ewen mcgreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been but the major problem was the story yes it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak boring at times and just silly i would recommend ice age or garfiled the movie rather than this film	16
0	my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u v lamp vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun vampires are supposed to be scary but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable the first underworld movie would be a good model	16

0	about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood do n't watch this	16
0	the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution	16

0	this movie has a good plot great acting and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos the profanity the undermining of parental authority and the lack of closure concerning landon 's journey to faith it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less than mature audience i saw more bad in it than good which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie	16
0	i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this	16

0	modigliani \( 2004 \) is a self indulgent pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist writer director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work ironically the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani despite his boundless enthusiasm andy garcia is simply too old for the title role an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight to video fate	16
0	i saw this at a friends house so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot not even lukewarm for that matter the acting is terrible please anyone who had anything to do with this do n't continue in the film industry if it was possible to assign negative stars i would do so for this awful experience run away	16
0	saw this on the box last night i sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve it did n't i kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film the dialogue is wooden the plot is pathetic the whole set up is unconvincing it looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole quot vegas quot craze which ranges from csi to quot the cooler quot \( incidentally quot the cooler quot is another one to avoid \) i would give this zero stars if i could	16

0	the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on you ca n't do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way	16

0	vci 's budget dvd starts out well enough for the obscure thriller lady ice with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come unfortunately as soon as the credits end the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs i 've ever seen on dvd pass on this one from vci and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits	16
0	nothing original here nothing overly humourous overall pretty bland in my opinion the only part i thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end	16

0	this is honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i love the first one but this one is just lame	16
0	the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going	16

0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	16

0	i'm sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target to imply that christians are typically mean and narrow minded is pure racism this is just as evil as implying that all jews are rich or that all african americans have rhythem what has jesus himself done to warrant such christian bashing out of hollywood \? the man has suffered enough on the cross leave him alone	16

0	jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end the only mystery is in the details no real suspense i found the plot to be a little farfetched	16
0	i bought this dvd because i really adore the strokes good music good people good style not so good documentary whoever made this video should not make anymore at all ! the strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures 10 second clips of them the exclusive interviews were not that exclusive no sound from any of the strokes no interviews with them i can go on i mean c'mon a documentary of the strokes should at least have the strokes in it right	16
0	i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off the mark african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it was n't his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all	16
0	i had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer the combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining many people love this video but i just had a bad experience with it	16
0	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	16
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction \( he makes the best of a limited repertoire \) it just gets boring	16
0	i'm a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word does n't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf the stories and characters are superficial boring and unintelligent people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get whacked a lot	16
0	i thought the movie was alright but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price	16
0	these plays were okay i'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre \( definitely no tyler perry quality on that note \) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he did n't	16
0	dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless	16
0	whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around \( few of them seem to have jobs \) and party all day the main character \( sid \) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college \( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism \) the film appeals to naive youth	16
0	this film was boring and convoluted one big mess that you shouldnot waste your precious cash on	16
0	guess i'm in the minority about this but this play \( not a movie \) left me thinking that i wasted my money i enjoyed madea she is a great character i never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems for me the only thing funny about it was when madea took the stage the rest of it was simply boring	16
0	i love pablo 's act on comedy central this one does n't even touch it	16
0	i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in you got served and was extremely disappointed the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those i do n't know the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video	16
0	this movie is a rehash of the first but it is a crappy unconvincing emotionally uninspiring movie let me guess what part 3 will be about a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time does not alter that timeline the way he wants \( i e always worst case scenario \) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else	16
0	terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid	16
0	we got jason in space and we get pinhead in space this is pure nonsense words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people it 's time to stop making these movies !	16
0	maybe this is not fair to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews and i am not buying this dvd as swamp fox is incomplete ! three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase	16
0	yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine	16
0	i love david cross 's comedy i love his stand up i love mr show but this dvd is not kinda boring it is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen there may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd there is no accounting for taste but 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released	16
0	i'm a huge orson welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge but i hated this film i was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that i just did n't get it the photography was classic welles the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum do n't get caught up in having to like it just because it 's welles it 's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world this movie blows	16
0	when i received this dvd i played it on my imac when doing this i discovered that there were chinese characters showing at the top of the screen the quality of the dvd images were dark and grainy i reported to amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated dvd and i was saddened to not have a response from amazon other than refunding my costs copyright is not only a law to protect publishers it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products i feel that i can no longer depend on amazon to provide my dvd orders	16
0	not a good script kind of slow a regular movie if you are into history in america but if you dont live there or got any interest in this particular plot i wont recomended is borin	16
0	maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie did n't take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor	16
0	i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years ago thanks to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family each of whom is brilliantly cast i have series 3 4 and now want 1 2 do n't wait any longer 24 episodes of absolute delight await you	16
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	16
0	as someone said in an earlier review the movie is split up into two parts the first part training camp was good i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam after that i found it unwatchable the main character is so annoying i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast if you 're looking for a good war movie look elsewhere	16
0	i have to say that even though teti hatcher 's performance was good the movie itself was terrible the plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable i can t believe i wasted my money on this one	16
0	great casting but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film it 's so aggravating i want to chew my own leg off half way into it i know part of it is everyone is a talker of a various sort they 're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell i just do n't think it works otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived the best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves it gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name mamet 's an extraordinary genius writer but this did not belong on the screen	16
0	this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin	16
0	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then	16
0	i discarded the dvd after watching it if you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home do n't buy this version of the secret garden	16
0	i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !	16
0	awful truly awful joanne sellar and daniel lupi \( producers of boogie nights and hard eight \) should be ashamed of themselves and so should the weinsteins for producing this piece of crap	16
0	leary is a hack he was n't influenced by bill hicks he stole material that makes him a hack how can you leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack \? take it up with webster 's dictionary the exact bits leary stole are described in the book american scream on pages 201 202 bill hicks was incensed when he heard leary 's tape on behalf of bill 's memory give credit to the original	16
0	the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known hollywood cliche in film making i applaud the effort the chicks in this film are happening babes fo sho but there ai n't much to the film but it has some fun to it	16
0	the kit was not worth its price the spatial effect is poor i 've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red blue paper glasses no i do n't have visual problem and i rigged up everything correctly the dvds itself were not interesting my kids were not impressed much it were not made me happier with the pack sorry this review seems against the others but it is my truth i 've stored it back into the box i do n't recommend this for you	16
0	i was expecting more because of the history on these tapes dvd 's this one was disappointing as you do n't feel like you did a workout i like the older ones better with tammy	16
0	the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there 's no mystery	16
0	ok i'm a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened \? did they run out of money \? did the writer write himself into a corner \? there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you	16
0	seeing what 's become of the rock and roll legends i remember from when we were much younger i found very depressing i 'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago even jerry lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home	16
0	unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie	16
0	this is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen the writing and acting as far as i am concerned are no better than that of a middle school live performance the only reason i did n't turn it off was that i was hoping something in the movie might help me justify spending 10 to buy it used that something never came i would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment such as quot schindler 's list quot amp quot the pianist quot trust me pass it up just as fast as you can	16
0	might be a good video it just does n't interest our 10 month old yet like baby einstein does	16
0	i'm not a mainstream beavis butthead fan the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular i was there from the beginning where the hell is frog baseball and burger world i want to see burger wars ! ! ! ! there was a time when beavis did n't even talk he just laughed \( heh heh heh \) fire fire ! ! ! i want season 1 2 3 just release them as seasons let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks i want full episodes with videos included every tv show is like this on dvd why is this one different \? ! demand full episodes and full seasons ! ! !	16
0	love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one	16
0	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	16
0	i ordered this dvd series because i liked kristy alleys performance in other movies and series but this is totally different a lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted after viewing two episodes i put it in the trash watching this does not make me happy	16
0	i was a bit disappointed in this tape the workouts are too easy i had masteredabs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel 2 i could n't find it so i bought this one but its too easy i found a used abs of steel 2 and i like it much better	16
0	i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless drawn out banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke \( stepped on \? \) we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star seems like a generous rating	16
0	this movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage i have ever seen aniston 's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him that is total nonsense i expected them to get back together in the end real people do not behave like this or maybe they do it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country	16
0	i must be missing something i bought this movie when i watched it i fell asleep its boring as hell trust me im a true horror fan and a gore fiend this movie was nothing the only gore was when this guy cut some lady in the heart and it looked so fake the only scary part was the end with this witch is everyone high but me \? this movie sucked ! boring as hell 2 stars	16
0	i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was and finally got a chance to watch her video i find her way overrated she does have some funny stuff she 's got a particular knack for doing impressions and there 's some other genuinely funny material however the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience she does a lot of vulgar material homosexual oriented jokes etc that are clearly just there for the outlaw value and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she 's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base it 's just not funny	16
0	i watched this movie not because i am into ms milano or her breasts but because it was shot \( sadly \) at my high school shattuck st mary 's school in faribault mn does n't say much for the school or for the faculty who had bit parts in it	16
0	i watched this movie and it sucked very slow it might be a renter not a owner	16
0	sit down under a tree give it a big hug fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs !	16
0	i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it	16
0	i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what 's up with that	16
0	i just finished watching das boot to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war u 571 is just more hollywood tripe if you just want 'splosions and escapism i guess u 571 does the trick if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come go with das boot	16
0	this is a terrible movie when it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers time had only added to it 's mediocrity	16
0	this is not a good movie ! bad acting story and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it	16
0	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful	16
0	i did n't watch millenium when it was on ten years ago so i thought i 'd give it a try on dvd as i'm a big x files fan i watched two shows the beginning and the end and the dogs they were ridiculous and boring i'm done with millenium	16
0	brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them this is a blatant effort to wrench young children 's emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of global warming by engaging their sympathies the only plot is brainwashing using penguins as the straw man the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them as a responsible parent i would avoid this entirely	16
0	i bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that i never got past the first 20 minutes i am not a prude but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff i put the video in my recycle box maybe it had some substance but i could not get past the first 20 minute	16
0	this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portrayingthe gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping yahushua jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand the so called scholarly comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tearit down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rddvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on	16
0	for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don't buy this dvd ! the death part of the dvd part 1 is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part 2 is new stuff very good but ! if you buy 'the end of evangelion' you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so do n't buy 'death rebirth' buy 'the end of evangelion' instead	16
0	i was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted i do n't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie it seemed very empty to me ! the fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me maybe if it was longer it would have been better \? i do n't know and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that seemed out of place ! ! sigh azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie	16
0	the transfer is real real bad the story is also weird but its o	16
0	do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer on many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible on several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television do n't make the mistake i made in hindsight i would only purchase this collection if i found it in a dollar bin sale which is most likely where these mill creek collections will be in a year or so	16
0	the crappiest dvd release ever ! video and audio quality sucks ! this is not a jet li movie buyer 's beware ! i 'll give this a negative rating	16
0	while not one of his best novels tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble ! ! skip it ! ! ! !	16
0	the story line was fair but the t a not so hot 2 star	16
0	this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it was n't really funny and it was n't scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you	16

0	this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood i'm not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition 's music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	16
0	i watched the first half hour of this and could n't get through it i dislike michael moore as much as anybody but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school it 's an amateurish whining documentary made more for spite \( and those 15 minutes we all want \) than anything else getting called down by michael moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside \( people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night \) does n't prove that michael moore followers are all waffling malcontents dude overall i rate this film fail	16

0	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets however i have to say this video was not what i expected there were some great vintage clips but not enough muppets monsters for me this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing i would recommend you pass on this one and get 123 count with me instead	16
0	my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh ! ! ! ! ! ! so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever ! ! ! the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it 's not as though they could n't find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve	16
0	not a good copy of this great movie i 'd wait and buy the quot restored authorized edition quot even though i bought this version i 've ordered the other that 's how much i like metropolis is general	16
0	this joe d'amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze bordering on pornography the plot or lack thereof is typical woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption to make the film last 80 minutes joe d'amato fills the story with lesbianism vile tortures naked women in rat infested sewers and plenty of gratuitous sex i gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore	16

0	between the amended politically correct ending to this famous tale and the so very hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges i could n't wait for this to be over ! the animation was very poor quality the music was not the focus my grandchildren lost interest shat else could possibly have been wrong	16
0	eddie murphy is a comical guy but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this \? of course who is the right guy for it \? one of the questions i ca n't stand to think about in this movie is how dolittle hears the animals speak but their lips move and nobody notices ca n't they connect the dots \? obviously not and obviously the filmmakers could n't either	16
0	way too expensive for a low quality product the clarity of the picture is poor there is not enough content to justify the price i do n't recommend it at all i feel i 've been cheated	16
0	this 1971 offering stars giancarlo giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison dipped needle before eviscerating them the production is above average slick and the performances are fine especially from giannini but i just did n't find it involving suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward it 's not bad just average the climax and the killer 's unmasking is particularly weak and anti climactic fans of the genre seem to really like this one but i suggest a rental before a purchase	16
0	the presentation of computer enhanced b w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library legacy of my father however the aural commentary of brannagh was repetitive and boring each episode basically repeated the same 6 octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections	16
0	okay i gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it did n't play right but after viewing it without the technical problems i would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter a good addition to any collection ancient muscle conditioning \? not many dvd 's out there on the subject i 've edited my original review and it wo n't allow me to give it more stars but i 'd give it 4 sorry mr keen if i cost you sales on this i commend you for putting this out	16

0	a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 's and mid 80 's allen got his name on the directorial map w this piece of fluff you gotta start somewhere tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later real comedies than an original film in its own right allen 's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so bad they 're fun movies	16
0	i agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter however the couple of minutes where rory block sings quot if i had possession over judgement day quot are worth the entire price of this dvd do n't buy the tape 'cos you 'll have to sit through so much stuff you wo n't make it but on the dvd you can go straight to rory block and never watch the rest	16

0	this version wind and cloud the storm riders made in 2004 is not the same as the storm riders made in 1998 this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng it is full screen and was made for tv it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen	16
0	the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i 've seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it 's almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film 's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote \? just okay nothing to write home about	16
0	after i saw the first two scary movies i decided too see this movie i thought the wayans brothers were the two writers but i can see that i was wrong this movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes i could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache ! i myself a teen which this movie appealed too did not find this funny i do n't know why teens like this movie so much ben russell	16

0	this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it	16
0	avoid this cheapo release of these great film ! subpar prints certainly not from original 35mm elements wait for the good one to come out down the road	16
0	this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out ! the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks	16
0	great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost did n't finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira 's voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	16
0	pablo francisco is like michael jordan on the wizards he just isnt as good as he used to be i hope he proves me wrong in future material save yourself some money and get his old work	16
0	i am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well it was kind of cornie but with yvonne \( lily munster \) decarlo and a great actor in rod steiger it held my interest also throw in michael j pollard who always plays an off the wall character and i guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	16
0	where to begin \? cliched pretentious flat static maudlin melodramatic homophobic and finally just plain boring start with an over the top caricature of a deaf mute patsy cline young drag queen arriving the big city pile on cardboard colorful characters like typical aids patient porno star and loud mouthed latina hot mamna and whaddya get \? an amateur film populated with some of the most unlikable unattractive characters ever all spewing some of the unbelievably bad dialogue ever written and to think the \( formerly talented \) director made the whole wide world also with d'onofrio \? go figure nice cover art though	16

0	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave pilot dave and fireman dave i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks unfortunately there 's a new dave \( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues \) and it 's just not the same the new dave is not bad perse but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all	16

0	the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame ! the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one 's arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one 's leg that 's it how incredibly dull ! what 's worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i would n't waste your time w this video	16

0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	16
0	do n't buy this from the grave is overdubbed b w film without bruce lee in it the other two are n't great either	16
0	solar flow is a fine dvd but should not be marketed as something separate from yoga shakti there are no new sequences just remixes of the shakti sequences since you can rearrange all the shakti sequences on your own solar flow is superfluous i do n't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice a little disclosure please ! rebecc	16
0	there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story \( in both regards \) have to do with the story as a whole \? nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin	16

0	this movie is not a war movie it is not remotely related to history either guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history since when did american troops in ww ii carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers \? this depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell \? can we spell bushido \? mallick ca n't now if you like touchy feely not the real world aesthetique have at it the scenery and photography is quite good	16
0	midway was the decisive naval engagement of the second world war decided by a handful of bombs hitting the japanese carriers over a period of a few minutes it is a riveting story that has been well told in several movies and innumerable books not here relying upon outtakes from tora tora tora \( and the wonderful japanese cast of that film \) what we have here is a pedestrian outing that should be avoided at all costs quite honestly \? the best version of the battle of midway was steven spielberg 's original star wars \( before it had roman numberals	16
0	wow was that ever awful ! i 'd write more but im busy cleansing my dvd player after loading that steaming pile ! !	16
0	i gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him what 's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain 's character swain 's character is a hillbilly who like 's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with i never really got why swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie this movie puts a bad taste in my mouth it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie \( do not buy \)	16
0	belushi 's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite monty python 's michael palin as the manly captain ned in the miles cowperthwaite skits they are both absent from this dvd nor on any snl video i can find	16
0	i bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves when we received it we found out it was a blu ray edition and our dvd player does n't accept blu ray dvd 's so i basically bought a movie i ca n't watch it should have been put in the description that this a blu ray edition for those of us who do n't have blu ray compatible dvd players	16
0	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	16
0	i give it 3 stars for porn and 2 stars for a movie therefore collectively you have your single star by all means i suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn beat off and then watch a real movie caligula blows literally and royally it is a little under 3 hours which seemed like 3 days and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film the small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn the most triumphant scene in the movie is where the roman soldiers attack the phallus humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro this movie is ridiculous in order to enjoy this one must be completely perverted and dimwitted	16
0	i really enjoyed the first urban legends movie but this one i was not impress by at all i wish i would have taken these reviews more seriously that i read before buying this dvd this was an awful cheapo urban legends movie theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was i see now theres a third urban legends movie out im not sure if that ones good or bad like this one if you have a couple of bucks to blow go ahead and get this one if you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie look else where p s no wonder this dvd is only 9 00 bucks	16

0	if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them this movie was not scary it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters you know what the best part was \? when it was over few movies compel me to write reviews good or bad this one obviously did	16
0	i watched ten minutes of beanie seagal trying to act and turned my dvd player off to read a book i had to i felt like i was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie it looked so common i did n't even need to see the rest to tell you the end i'm willing to bet some people got shot somebody got away with the crime the police arrested beanie and somebody 's mother was yelling at somebody i do n't even care if i'm right or wrong because regardless i'm not gonna finish watching this movie	16
0	it 's been 30 years since i 've seen this film on cable i decided to re visit this obscure film and see if i missed anything in the initial viewing as it turned out i did n't miss anything it 's pretty much the same routine sam peckinpah film filled with lots of blood guts bullets and slow motion action it 's also a long tedious film that is not one of his best but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra violence in their movies	16
0	i watched parts of all the let 's dance salsa dvds and what a joke is this guy serious \? he needs to get a few dvds himself to find out about salsa rhythm lead and following and just general concepts of dancing i agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews what qualifies him as an instructor \? i think he 's doing an injustice to salsa if anyone is considering learning from these dvds do n't you 'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing but you 'll be a joke on the dance floor the only worth these dvds have to anyone interested in salsa is for a good laugh seriously amazon should consider removing this product	16
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	16
0	this video was not animated like the classic chuck jones features such as the cat in the hat and the grinch my daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation we give this video a thumbs down	16
0	i take this title form the video store thinking in wynton marsalis when i was watching the dvd i can appreciate that the image is very good \( not great and i have a 720p tube tv \) and the sound is very good also \( not great i have a reference equipment \) but the show is so boring look you just desire this man stop to blow the drum 's solo is just awesome but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	16

0	i did n't know that they made music videos this long if i had known that 's all that this was i would never have watched it this is a horrible film ! save your time and money and avoid this monstrosity !	16
0	this does n't really do anything for me maybe if you have n't ever worked out before it may be a good beginning for you to start	16
0	this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood i'm not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition 's music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	16
0	the only reason why i stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because i paid to see it awful movie not entertaining at all it was just so poor the animation was n't fantastic political messages should n't be in children movies not a good movie	16
0	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	16
0	this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you 'd expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a 'special edition'	16
0	mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks	16
0	i saw tarzan the ape man on hbo or cinemax when i was a teenager and it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was stupid and had no plot	16
0	the only reason i gave this dvd set 2 stars instead of the 5 that i would rate the show itself is because there are absolutely no extras on this dvd set no featurettes no cast interviews not even any episode commentaries while i appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner i 'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes	16
0	travolta was great in saturday night fever but this country version just did n't work although he 's a good actor he just was wrongly cast in this film	16
0	overproduction and heavy use of repetitive special effects \( such as rothbart 's enlarged and projected image flying over the heads of siegfried and odette \) make this version of swan lake funny anorexia survivor evelyn hart 's role as odette odile makes watching the video painful she is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing i was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second not worth the money in my opinion	16
0	i bought basically because i love denisee richards and daryl hanna plus i like also valerie tasso besides i am a fan of pierre woodman they all appear on the film among some well know adult stars like dora venter rita faltoyano but really the film is not good at all it is slow the elements do n't match it is sometimes hard to follow it is really not worth buying it	16
0	my objection was the implication that the stars played a part in the film i felt that the picture was completely deceptive ms richards and ms hanna had less than 15 minutes \( maybe a little more but not much and possible even less \) and were clearly there to fool the viewer it was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary	16
0	note that in my previous review in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer i was only referring to the quot that touch of mink quot dvd the father goose dvd is not that bad	16
0	this is one of the worst edited documentary i have ever seen you can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes slow motion and unnecessary digital fx i have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min mtv music clip or a tv add but on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick if fine edited all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours each episode has a more than 2 min introduction during the episodes you see some shots more than ten times by the way i am a very long time aviation enthousiast	16
0	the movie is a piece of art one of my all time favorites the extended edition dvd is very badly compiled the bonus features are sub par with bad video quality the alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film and do not have the bi look and feel other special features are small and without much substance the extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended it is not a director 's cut \( the dvd states this upfront in the opening credits \) so it not fun to watch do n't get this if you are looking for a lotr style extended edition	16
0	how can people like this piece of trash \? what a stinker ! i think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons and all that endless talk about quot the institute quot which looked like it was setup in someone 's garage i can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational it motivated me to turn off the t v and go for a ride i really believe this movie was produced by satan	16
0	i bought the faith hill dvd to hear her sing but instead the songs were interrupted with talking i would rather have had the talking put to one side and be able to place the music uninterrrupted wish i could get my money back ! ! ! so spend your money on another dvd	16
0	when we tried to play the item on our dvd player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it we ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer which worked properly i am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded i can see deducting shipping and handling but a restocking charge that is outrageous ! the merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it ! please remind me not to buy from amazon com	16
0	i wonder if they 'll continue this to focus on the kid the father and the other people \? who really cares to be honest such trash	16
0	this scooby doo vhs is absoulty horrible ! ! it lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the scooby doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like plus its higher cost i paid 9 95 trust me buy scooby doo 2 or scooby doo cyber chase those keep the kids glued to the t v very exciting just the way we want scooby doo to be ! !	16
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	16
0	just look how many are for sale thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is it has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting i fastforwarded about 70 of the movie ! and what got me was on the back it says family friendly im still laughing about that ! what has this world come to \? i would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone ! even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person does n't buy or rent this movie im embarassed that i rented it ! please turn away now	16

0	the ordering speed of delivery were great but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points the wrong movie was delivered i ordered honeymoon in vegas and received leaving las vegas and it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for christmas so that was bad	16
0	what a horrendous experiment in comedy if you like jerry lewis i guess you 'll love this travesty of a film if you are a film snob you will love it personally as neither i am grossly disappointed and just really did n't get quot the joke quot it was trite and dull there was no point the plot technology encroaching on humanity well good try but again not for me if i am looking for a laugh i will watch a good coen brothers film	16
0	this is the first and only dvds i will buy from this company this could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy i learned absolutely nothing and the women were disgusting trust me do not buy this dvd if your life depends on it	16
0	i bought the dvd for my collection after watching the film on tcm the musical perfomances are terrific upon receiving the dvd i was very disappointed in the quality of the dvd production the dvd states digital sound but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on tcm	16

0	the first two seasons of chef ! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch season three however is virtually unwatchable they changed director changed from film to video tape replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history i would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons	16
0	jet li as a contrac killer \? come on ! the reason why this movie is n't that famous is because it pretty much sucks it 's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie no realy kung fu here	16
0	this movie is so dumb that it 's as good with the sound off as with the sound on the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script but this script has no charm no wit no nothing	16
0	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out i was extremely disappointed the movie very well could be alright on its own merits but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	16
0	i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	16
0	there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	16
0	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed	16
0	ca n't add much to the discussion about the movie but wanted to say that this dvd listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of school daze it says it has both full screen and widescreen but it doesnt	16
0	i was also disappointed with this dvd as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers i think the title yoga for beginners is misleading as this dvd contains many advanced yoga routines also on the back of the dvd it said it contained a core workout 20 min but no such workout is actually on the dvd ! i purchase the pilates for inflexible people at the same time as this dvd and i much prefer it although i wish i 'd known that two of the workouts from the pilates dvd were on the yoga dvd before i bought them both	16
0	i did not like this dvd at all it requires too many props such as bricks belts towels blankets chairs etc each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations as a beginner i find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention i feel it was a waste of money and do n't recommend it	16
0	what a great cast ! i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie right \? after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it although you are shaking your head in disbelief ! stunning ! you 've never seen anything quite like it ! if you are a fan of the campy awful you may see it as a masterpiece if not you will still have a unique viewing experience proceed at your own risk ! borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it did i mention the great cast \? so many of my favorites even goodman ca n't save this clunker	16
0	terrible movie i really like denzel washington as an actor but in this movie it was very dissapointing he is much better when he plays to be a good person that fights for justice and what is right	16
0	i had not realized what great performers michael flatley colin dunne and jean butler were until i watched this version of riverdance the lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions what made riverdance great for me was the precision timing and dancers dancing togeather in the irish dance numbers it is all gone here try riverdance live from new york city or the video tape riverdance the show instead this version should not have been released	16
0	this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the 80s actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so	16
0	i found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that i had to quit watching this after about 20 of the video the movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise \( about a 4 \) the sound of the singing was very grating harsh to my ears since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible it also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content the photography art direction were exquisite	16
0	this has a run down of the colts season from game one to the super bowl thats it do not expect the super bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is very disappointing the afc championship game of the week is just a post game show i would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game it was better then the super bowl the only good things where the few extras with manning and harrison wired for sound i hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much	16
0	five stars for the movie one star for this dvd because it is missing the key scene when clara talks to her parents in their bedroom after marty drops her off the dvd cuts from clara putting her key in the door to marty walking to the bus stop why the scene is cut i have n't a clue	16
0	over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself	16

0	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to quot act quot in this film after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch do anything you can to get out of sitting through this	16
0	not worthy of the firm name this workout was repetitive boring and does n't belong in a firm lineup if you 're a true firm believer and love the originals don't waste your time with this one it will only disappoint	16
0	i placed a wrong order and so now i am not able to watch the dvd i purchased it was for area no 1 but we can't watch the no 1 area movies in turkey therefore i do not have a review	16
0	even though amanda is quite attractive the camera work is bad the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment there are few close ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost this is for you	16
0	i bought a couple of bob vidoes through amazon for my son age nearly 2 who loves the series we were crushingly disappointed by these videos though the wonderful voices of the uk version \( neil morissey et al \) have been replaced by american voices why do they do that \? for us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ai n't bob british shoppers and anyone familiar with the original bob should be warned \( can i get my money back \?	16
0	avril 's music is ok but i hate this dvd she 's trying to be gothic or whatever and it does n't work it looks like she shopped at hot topic or something avril quit being goth ! you have no reason too ! and you are n't gothic therefore get singing lessons and make a cd because girl sorry you ca n't sing but yeah avril plays the guitar so it 's ok but 1 star for this goth imitation dvd	16
0	i'm watching the film right now and it is perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film i 've ever seen there 's nothing amusing going on it 's all fluff and show it is such garbage i find it offensively stupid	16
0	more time could have been spent in ney york city for this movie like with friday the 13th part seven the new blood all of the good gore scenes were cut out but still this is a terrible movie and i am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five	16
0	many have seen this movie on tv many times for a b movie it is great fun and interesting to watch no extras on the dvd i wish they did add something from behind the scenes etc	16
0	after seeing match point which i loved i figured i had to see scoop all i can say is oh my gawd ! scoop is perhaps the worst movie i 've ever seen woody allen really should stay out of his own movies and the rest of it the story acting editing etc were just painful to watch i ca n't believe he went from match point to this dribble	16
0	stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes' and steven seagal 's they are brain dead movies with brain dead screenplays bad directors bad everythings this movie like other viewers' said drove me nuts i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys' movies otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration amazon com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie god help us	16
0	aside from the insanely beautiful lead actress this is pretty run of the mill stuff not scary only sort of gross but i think it 'd be best in print clive barker deserved better than this	16
0	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry ! !	16
0	this complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone star movie with cringingly awful acting laughable special effects \( the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment \) appalling dubbed dialogue cheesy music inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere the grim reaper is a total disaster do n't waste your money on this turkey	16
0	this is the dumbest most predictable horrible waste of time i 've ever ever seen this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply was n't it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that 's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe drink and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash my only hope is that our european friends did n't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident	16
0	just repeat the following several times 1 \) draggy plot2 \) uninspired acting especially allen who almost sinks it3 \) unimaginative \( story direction etc \) then get a hitchcock film	16
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	16
0	so i finally rented this tripe as i was curious gee making fun of former soviet block nations people and rednecks now there 's some seriously funny stuff not ! what 's next \? a cutting edge comedy on the rap culture \? oops he already did this with the ali g show gross out potty humour now that 's inventive and we 've never seen that before ! i also like the lame o attempt to show how americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something these are your imagined demons foes sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a yakov smirnoff comedy bit	16
0	i got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it i bought season two and was pretty dissappointed the show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one i loved the ideas for episodes but did n't care much for how they played out bill got soft cuddles and dan got mean buttons and rocko stayed about the same but it was n't enough great show but stick with season one	16
0	does anyone know if there is a real pg 13 version of this film \? i 've been told it came out as a pg 13 and then was changed to an r film pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see	16
0	this animated perversion of star wars is an insult to one of the best sci fi epics of all times the characters are utterly rediculus \( seriously if the jedi were that actually powerful why did they need the clones \? \) there is no plotline to speak of and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting if you want a good build up to episode iii i suggest playing star wars republic commando and reading labyrinth of evil and the other clone wars novels do n't wast your money on this it 's not worth it	16
0	i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham \( t v 's alien nation \) is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought ! the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it ca n't save this one from being just a let down skip it	16
0	i was just using this tape and ended it half way through to write a review the cueing stinks and is frustrating i am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using firm tapes on and off for about 15 years this one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is so frustrating you want a work out where you actually work not waste your time trying to read the instructor 's mind and falling all over the bench !	16
0	a dismal disappointment i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy when i see the high ratings i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done a complete multifaceted joy i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue well it did n't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings	16
0	this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they ca n't sell it so they 're giving them away hide fast	16
0	this is arnolds fakiest film i mean a demigod \? i ca n't believe this at all fakiest film yes arnold is in peak condition in this film but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow come on arnold no one talks back to zeus	16
0	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot or even his characters but his style for instances his endless digressions about history politics and philosophy for the movie we are left with nothing but plot and character ok what is one to do \? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie this is a slow film it takes an hour and a half story and takes three hours to tell it i ca n't recommend the film	16
0	i heard that the nfl was releasing the past superbowls on dvd i was excited to say the least then i found out these are only highlight films a real dissappointment to say the least the films are available in their entirety why not release them \? i was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls as were several of the people that i was at a super bowl party with this year too bad the nfl fell short again	16
0	i have several kathy smith videos this is the absolute worse ! i agree with some of the other reviewers that kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated also it seems like there a too many people in such a small space the whole set looks very chaotic i wonder if kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself it is very poor all those crazy shuffle moves ! any other kathy smith workout will be better for you than this one	16
0	this is not the restored print of dracula 1931 that universal previously released on dvd a few years earlier if you have that dvd keep it as the quality on this box set is awful i can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this did n't bother to look or did n't know that universal had a fully restored copy of this film	16
0	i was fortunate to be able to see a live preformance in my home town about 12 years ago i do n't beleive that this effort is up to par	16
0	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview ofdurango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids whilecute outsmart all the stupid adults the first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around durango including the steam train \( that 'swhy i purchased a used copy \) but then it goes into time travel to saveouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children do n't bother unless youlove durango as much as i do	16
0	absolute junk one of the worst films i have seen you will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration	16
0	i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you do n't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny droning music	16
0	the film seems to focus on 70 's punk exclusively anything post 1980 is glossed over clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this documentary i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time \( although the misfits were n't mentioned which i found odd \) the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well however in order to claim to be a documentary the evolution of punk rock is just as integral \( perhaps more so \) as its origins i think basically letts based the film on his own opinions likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk i was disapointed	16
0	what was john singleton thinking i know he produces good films but this is far worse the shaft from the 70s was sexier cooler more aggressive and classer than jackson this was a watered down verison where parks and roundtree made cameos it 's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character no love making and ect do n't even waist your time ! if you want to see it check it out on cable tv or something save your money	16
0	i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce	16
0	after watching this movie i wish an asteroid would hit earth or the movie studio that put it out and what a lame 4th of july scene i hope the movie extras in that scene did n't get paid especially the putz in the white t shirt geeeesh what a waste of video tape	16
0	this smarmy kevin costner vehicle is a trite half baked movie i found this movie nearly unwatchable if you 're looking for outstanding movies with a baseball theme try bull durham and eight men out	16
0	this film starts out so promising it could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief and the legitimacy of the concept of free will instead the characters dribble into infantile sexuality and the film becomes a travelog i ca n't believe this film found financing a real waste of obvious talent the effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste	16
0	i purchased dick cavett 's john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett 's interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best	16
0	no reviews available pre purchase set was totally useless laughably out of date poor color two disks had flasws at the ends i wanted to use them for a bible study group but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash the cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted i exopected better of amazon	16
0	i could n't watch this till the end bad production values gimmicky desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the nnui if you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken both intelectually and viscerally try something like miike 's ichi the killer makes this movie look so so needless the leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute 2 stars for the eye candy	16
0	i ca n't believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews the premise is absurd namely that anybody would even think about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place wo n't hang preposterous in itself for smoking some hash my advice to joaquin phoenix would have been sorry pal but get a better lawyer a ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent	16
0	i enjoy greek mythology and i love this story although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character jason who acted like he was stoned throughout the film i was expecting the hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized komoto dragon \( lost me there \) this film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip overall i was dissappointed and was expecting more sorry	16
0	this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ! complete waste of my time	16
0	the first half of this movie starts out promising the 2nd half is not so good it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical whereas it started out charming and promising of particular annoyance is the ending where we find the hackneyed politically correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple 's separation and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he indeed the wife 's character is strikingly uneven in this movie her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half quite inconsistent	16
0	cursed is the most pathetic werewolf movie i 've seen since an american werewolf in paris the acting is terrible directing is poor \( shame on you mr craven \) and the storyline is largely uncompelling the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is cool but if you 're looking for a scary movie do n't look for cursed well at least it 's not as bad as an american werewolf in paris but that sure as hell is n't saying much	16
0	i am a fan of dbz i am a fan of goten i think hercule is funny and i think 18 is hot yet this movie sucked ! it was missing what makes dbz so great lots of action and a great plot broly is overused and this completely ruins him like most dbz movies it does n't fit into the timeline if we worked it in then goten and trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the fusion technique had this movie taken place after then the fight would be a lot more interesting in short if you want to see every dbz movie then rent it if you insist on collecting the whole series wait until movie collection 4 comes out	16
0	children of the corn ii terence knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage the special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst the acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production the gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to holly upstairs acting school to write such junk and to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me	16
0	i have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of british comedy once you get past the numerous jokes about mrs slocum 's cat and a flaming mr humphreys you have very little left to justify it 's long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time in retrospect it is lacking many will disagree with me but that 's life	16
0	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i was n't shocked disturbed or upset just bored	16
0	i like almost all of lifetime 's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best the name bring obsessed was not what it should have been called the lady was dreaming and had an illness this movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through this movie was not what i had expected as i said i like almost all of lifetime original movies but i definitely wa n't be watching this one again	16
0	i viewed this dvd and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars this is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it 's kind of lame it shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers i still have not made the connection as to why ron jeremy has anything to do with this documentary ! ladies if you are expecting to see skin this dvd shows very little others may have a limmited interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the us	16
0	pick any house on any street pick any random two people \( man and woman \) give them a script and let them go wild i promise you could make this movie work better than the producers nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring the acting and settings in this movie are just horrible by the end you want everyone to die just to become interested now i do n't usually give bad ratings and i really like b horror films but the lack of effort here is unbelievable just nothing to interest me	16
0	i resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years i make it 200 the other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler i just loved the u s air force personnel with scottish and english accents they must have overrun the 500 budget at that point	16
0	with a very good scenario and a fantastic kris kristofferson the film is slow over male attitude and finally poorly made and boring	16
0	even though tsui hark is one of my favorite hong kong directors this movie did not at all show his skill the story was poor along with the actors performances i may be a little biased since i love john woo and tsui hark killed their friendship by making this movie worth checking out but i would'nt buy it if i were you	16
0	i agree with everyone that wants old nick i remember putting on the tv and watching legends of the hidden temple guts are you afraid of the dark \? and so on put them on dvd people would surely buy it	16
0	i totally agree with soda fizz because im 18 now and i grew up watching these old shows like doug angry beavers are u afraid of the dark rocco pete and pete all that etc they sould put those shows on in rotation and put them out on dvd im sure there are tons of people out there who would buy them \( me being one of them \) bring back the old shows	16
0	this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it what a waste	16
0	it is so strange for a famous actor like stallone to play as bad as stowe may be it is competition between them to make you exhausted of watching this film this boring story is about a bodyguard which has been repeated in different films many times the worst is the director who could not manage the film after 15 minutes it made me sleep i regret for the money that i paid for the dvd	16
0	i watched this with my parents and did n't like marlons mouth reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something he cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far what is cool about that \? that whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school and my neighborhood the rest of the movie was all right but marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity sorry that 's just my opinion	16
0	with the all star lineup this movie had i would 've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the gov of lousiana this could have been a really good gangster flick all the people were avaialable sean penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something i really could not follow could have put his skills onto something better this movie is a complete waste of talent money you name it	16
0	the movie has a great story unlike streetfighter alpha the movie alpha generations actually follows the correct storyline it had the potential to be a great movie but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately the character design sucks \( why dose n't ryu look like ryu \? \) the english voice acting sucks \( i recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles \) and the fights suck the only fight worth watching during the whole movie is ryu vs sakura this film dose n't even deserve a 1 star rating i just gave it that because there 's no way to go lower	16
0	if shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play othello he would remove heaven and earth crying out for justice be an actor in a play of shakespeare it 's difficult and only the best ones can do it not mediocre actors with face of children what 's martin sheen doing here \? he should be in better movies and in this trash if you want a good othello adaptation get the movie with kenneth brannag and laurence fishburne are good actors and a better movie	16
0	the frist time i saw this movie i hated it however i saw it again it still not that great but i own a copy its good to watch ewhen i feel sick or am stuck in the house for some other reason however the other two movies are much better	16
0	i was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd i would not recommend anyone buying this dvd until the quality is back to that of a professional recording	16
0	terrible follow up to the first movie this movie does not hold a candle to the first classic movie staring john travolta and olivia newton john the acting is bad and it is not worth the money it belongs where most grease belongs in a bucket under the sink	16

0	while i absolutely love the show on pbs this season was mispackaged the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1 2 unfortunately i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it if you buy this be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series	16
0	corny science fiction less favorite of mine not even in the top 10 ! afi took the idea on a better approache of this movie about a boy robot !	16
0	i would give this 5 stars after sitting through about 20 minutes i gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining	16
0	the technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where what 's the point \? 3000 is creepy as usual and big boi 's acting is horrible when he 's paired against terrence howard they only got 1000 screens nationwide for this movie but it does n't matter 3000 screens or 1000 screens the bottom line is that this movie sucks	16
0	this is nothing but a huge dissapointment there 's almost nothing on this video about baseball if there was a rating lower than zero stars i would give it that rating	16
0	warning ! the blood and black lace disc has a known problem with not being able to play in a philips magnavox 825 and various pioneer players including dv 414 dv 515 and dvl 909	16
0	everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quot good cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time	16
0	ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina 's breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time \( ie killer kondom \) but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week	16
0	i bought this dvd for my grandson because he loves airplanes and trains too much commentary and very little action shots of trains and airplanes it did not keep his interest a total waste of money	16
0	just show the real machines working forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and does n't even hold my son 's interest he much prefers the fred levine series or the i love cat machines series	16
0	just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the dvd it 's fullscreen and does n't have any special features now if you 've seen the scenes that were n't included in the extended vhs but were for some reason on the cable version you 'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie i 'd really like to see this one get maybe a double dvd release with when nature calls souped up and some of those great missing scenes including ace singing onstage with cannibal corpse \( funniest scene in the whole movie i thought \) ace conversing with a few drunks in ray finkle 's hometown and some others	16
0	unable to view because of incompatible format \( as you warned me ! \) however my ancestor james mclintock of barnsley yorkshire england sent john wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film \( which is why i wanted the dvd \) so	16
0	why \? because it has good sound dts hd 5 1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim	16
0	por qu se le ocurri a tim burton hacer un remake de este cl sico \? el resultado no puede ser peor s lo fui a verla porque sale tim que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo nico que vale la pena de toda la historia tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego qu no se apague nunca ! you are the best !	16
0	i got this for my fifth grade class it 's better than the social studies textbook but not fun i 'll probably have to make worksheets to go with it basically a kid reads a history report as a voice over while the peanuts kids occasionally do something	16
0	i love a lot of b movie horror but this not that great i thought it would be better having gunner hanson in it and gordon lewis the story line was ok the gore wasnt there little sceens of it again i thought there would be more \( shockorama \) anyways if your thinking about getting it i would first rent it see if you like it i wouldnt waste your money on the full price dvd the music score was cool for sure	16
0	i was so excited when i read the reviews for this intermediate level pilates tape thought i would purchase it for variety from my 'the method' pilates tape i was very disappointed the tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat i did n't feel like i got a good tone workout i actually wanted to fall asleep i felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student i give two stars because i do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but i shall be passing this on to an elderly relative	16
0	i saw dead ringers in the movies the theater was filled with mostly couples when it was over as we walked out laughter began to spread as we all recognized that we as couples were having the same conversation whose stupid idea was it to pay money to see this move !	16
0	i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense	16
0	i am a howard stern fanatic and a softball fanantic i could n't go wrong with this movie right \? wrong ! it is pretty bad i was disappointed with artie 's project gross jokes terrible acting there are a couple of funny scenes wait until it is on sale	16
0	i was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie i could n't get past the first 15 minutes incoherent beginning and overly stylized particularly where ashe becomes the avenger \( for lack of a better name \) nothing like the original at all which i love by comparison	16
0	as some of the other reviewers have mentioned this us release has replaced the original source music but the region 2 version has been released without these cuts so for everyone with a multiregion player i 'd suggest using amazon co uk to buy a copy there instead	16
0	seriously the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles there is a lot of video jittery things going on it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very very bad analog copy on top of all the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases	16
0	than have to watch this movie again it just kept going on and on and on and on and on like winter in siberia with no point at the end i did n't care whether or not gerda ever found kai i was frozen with boredom	16
0	the only reason i gave this movie a star was because there is no zero star option where does seagal continue to get backing for his movies the last 8 \( or 10 \? \) have all been awful his last good release was under seige i only wish my 401k grew as fast as his waistline submeged is bad no suprise there it will be the last movie of his i watch i just ca n't take it any more submerged \? must be a reference to his movie career which went under about a decade ago	16
0	the dvd came in a timely manner packaged well and i have had no problems with the item it seems to be in great condition	16
0	why \? why waste your time and money on producing crap \? sony execs must be out of their minds the ghostbuster fans have been waiting years and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on dvd and this is what they come up with \? no give us season dvds give us a 140 episode box set give us something not 4 non sequential episodes on a disc that can hold many times that what a waste this product gets 1 star because apparently you ca n't give it zero	16
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	16
0	there are way to many lesbians still killing themselves because of the stresses of being a lesbian it 's not even mildly acceptable that there are still more suicide as an option self victimization films that are being praised and sold to us	16
0	quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time clive owen is really cool but not in this movie angelina jolie 's polital agenda totally fueled this film what a waste of time	16
0	i turned the movie off was that supposed to be funny \? yes some kids' toy \( that happens to be a small motorized electric model of a truck \) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village i mean was this taken from the original stephen king book then shame on you mr king that 's overdoing the terror already so overdone not that the consept of trucks did n't appeal to me but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so called horrormaster so far believe it or not	16
0	abraham lincoln 's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to abe once he was done lincoln said the people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like beaches is fine it is obviously a chick flick bette midler has some real opportunities to sing the acting is good the problem is that the plot is so predictable	16
0	just ca n't believe that someone with that much money could put out a piece of crap like this ! ! so so disappointing paul ! ! we need a direct live show no film ! and direct to dvd without 90 of audience pauls pretty taken with his old self ! ! nice dye job	16
0	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
0	dolph lundgren stars as a mercenary sent to kill a tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation dull and just plain pointless \( and stupid \) action film suffers from inept action scenes and logic lapses lundgren is imposing but ca n't act	16
0	this is one of the worst films ever made ! and i mean it ! ! one of the worst scripts i have ever come across the acting is hammy and the direction is very weak ! there was no reason for this movie to exist ! quot turbulence quot was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels ! no way ! if you like the 1st mabye try quot turbulence 2 fear of flying quot but stay away of the 3rd this is one terrible movie ! believe me !	16
0	this is not a review of this item but the whole series not only are the films in this bundle not all musicals this bundle is sent intstead of the purchased bundle until amazon straightens out the mess in titles forget ordering alice faye and betty grable bundles particularly marquee musicals	16
0	the only good thing on this dvd are the interview segments with gidget gein this was the most boring dvd i have ever watched and i actually started to fall asleep the first time i attempted to watch it	16
0	i bought this because i was familar with the space ghost show and liked it and the fact that this was 50 off it is strange in an uncomfortable way and tends to be very long in parts	16
0	normally the prices on here are competative but i agree they 're off base heredeep disciunt dvd is over 100 00 less for this set and free shippingc'mon amazo	16
0	after doing this film steve martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it but roxanne la story and bowfinger are some of steve 's best works	16
0	this was not the entire version of the hbo special i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it	16
0	i purchased this dvd and i was shocked to see the terrible violence and gore especially on innocent animals i wouldn't recommend this dvd to the faint of heart especially to persons under 18 this was certainly a bad choice of purchase on my part	16
0	overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal 's performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it was n't making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing did n't like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it 's normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	16
0	this mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny considering the comedic caliber of its two stars billy crystal and robin williams i was expecting a laugh riot but that 's not what this is it 's not their fault it 's the scriptwriter 's i guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper but that humor just did n't translate to the screen despite the best efforts of mssrs crystal and williams they deserve better and so do we	16
0	this movie is soooooo boring ! ! ! ! the only thing good about this movie is the superfly soundtrack laced by none other than curtis mayfield ! ! ! avoid this movie it sucks	16
0	i an not a prude but i watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend i watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny with the exception of the fist scene and the language was ridiculous and gross ! yuk	16
0	this is a nice item to add to a collection of d d trinkets but in no way is good it is lacking in story and acting a lot of the scenes were pleasant but i was never compelled by the story i would only recommend this to a hard core collector or a funny break from your current game	16
0	it has been a couple years since i 've seen this and i can still honestly say that it 's like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking a kind of swirly colorful mess with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick and ca n't escape it 's yuck of a screenplay on a positive note jim carrey is n't in it other then that nothing can redeem henry selick kaja blackley and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity and i mean that from the bottm of my heart	16
0	ah um well my brother picked this up not too long ago and well it sucks ! it 's the worst of the whole series ! i thought it would have to do with the mask michael wears in the others but not a ficken thing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital but then i took one because of how bad the rest was	16
0	this is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet i request you to do the needful thanking youprince georg	16
0	agree that it was beautifully filmed but there must have been a great deal lost in the translation	16
0	this version bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story the book was a simple good story why did they abandon it and the characters so completely \? the sets and costumes are great but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period \? i have only watched the first disc but it be a while before i will be able to force myself to watch the others	16
0	she is a little poser ! ! ! kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies wearing that stupid little diaper always so happy she wo n't be so happy when i kick her between the legs also those stupid little cowboy boots she really sucks i 'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry that shown her ! ! ! the movie was good but she stinks	16
0	this pilot is so bad the acting the writing the directing the costumes it 's a miracle that b5 ever got even one season approved by the suits at least they could have gotten decent actors pretty much every character on this pilot is represented by a piss poor actor and the writing is grade school \( i think this is what real people do \) tripe horrible rotten useless junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
0	my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great i was wrong it was pure hollywood garbage	16
0	no reviews for this video as the disk i have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of no disk is displayed as the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a dvd is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the dvd as i have to ship in from india so i can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk	16
0	second straight to video sequel to 1995 's quot the substitute quot has part time mercenary part time substitute teacher treat williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced up jock students williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university 's football team to a local mafia goon pretty good in a dumb saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then well swiss cheese i guess	16
0	this is the worst transfer to dvd i 've ever seen ! ! ! i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better do not waste your money ! !	16
0	i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star	16
0	if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 9	16
0	by the title i would be led to believe that there is more than one george story there is one george and a few others one of which scares my 2 1 2 year old i thought the stories would be animated however some \( including george \) are pictures from a story book we love to read books but videos should be more than photos of a story book would not recommend this	16
0	i would love to provide a review of this dvd however since i 've not received it despite having placed my order in august \( it 's now november \) and having written to amazon customer service about the matter \( as yet unanswered \) i'm afraid any review will have to wait	16
0	this one was really boring only buy this if you are trying to collect all the scooby dvds or if you have a very young child very young children might find this mildly entertaining this is not a movie for older kids teenagers adults who are fans of scooby doo i loved scooby doo zombie island witch 's ghost alien invaders cyberchase and legend of the vampire if you want to get a good scooby doo dvd get those instead scooby doo and the monster of mexico was a huge disappointment too but this was actually even worse	16
0	cool band worst videos ever ever makes me like them less fearless freaks is good this is garbage	16
0	i love cinderella and try to see them live whenever they 're in town but the sound on this dvd is just horrible did n't anyone listen to it before releasing it \? the video quality is fair they sure did n't spend a lot of money on production here i was very disappointed and wish i could get my money back	16
0	neither my husband or i could get into the movie i dont think i would ever watch this film again it was not what it was made out to be	16
0	watched like reading a comic book so many murders for so little money corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature lousy acting directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario \? give me a break	16
0	no no no ! ! ! dvd technology is for quality image and movie collectors this time artisan did not pay respect i think it 's the worst dvd in my collection bad transfer full frame and etc	16
0	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
0	man i hate this ! i cannot take this any more watch the original and that is it the original needs no sequel at all every sequel to the original sucks	16
0	what 's wrong with this show \? 1 jim wears the same pants coat and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series 2 a slow sluggish middle aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums 3 wo n't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her \? 4 do you really believe that this middle aged heavy fellow would drive a firebird a tight fitting car \? 5 angel ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
0	one of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again maybe i'm hoping the movie will get better with time unfortunately judge dredd does not ! i'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre cgi an action hero star a comic relief and a beautiful love interest but please do n't mess with the storyline maybe thiis is the case for future shock and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person 's humanity and dredd forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary in fact i feel two stars is gviing this movie too much !	16
0	anything having to do with paris hilton is doomed to be garbage the premise of the story is trite and in the end leaves the audience wondering whaaaaa the only person not to die is scottish and that 's the only reason why he didnt because he 's scottish what \? \? \? \? \? sick plot dumb characters overall dulllll how many movies will they make with a group of friends in a secluded castle yes i borrowed the movie which is great compared to paying 20 00 for the dvd and wasting my money and time watching it yawwwwwwwwwwn ! !	16
0	this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining	16
0	this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time it 's unauthorized by muse so therefore there were no interviews no live footage and none of their music was included they interviewed people who had never even met the band i learned nothing new from watching it do n't waste your money	16
0	amazon should send all of these 25th anniversary dvd 's back to uni the faulty product locks up after about 1 1 2 hours on both my panasonic and sony dvd decks ! i see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product simply put don't buy this lousy universal product ! ! !	16
0	i love speilberg films i really do but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap i just do not like it its not my thing i ca n't belive that richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense if you want to watch it then go ahead we all have different tastes however if you want to see a real speilberg film watch ones like duel jaws et schindler 's list jurassic park the lost world jurassic park and the indiana jones trilogy	16
0	ehhhhh what is this \? this is one very stupid movie how do i get a refund	16
0	racer takes on a rookie wow we 've never seen that before have we \? the worst thing about this movie are the race scenes many of which resemble a video game i 'd rather watch abc sports' to live and drive the indy 500 that 's more realistic and much more fun	16
0	when i first got this disc the other day it would not play at all i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive and it played however it does not play well at all the video is constantly dragging or skipping the audio is fine though i ca n't really provide a review of the content since so far it is unwatchable this is the only disc that has given me issues	16
0	its probably alright if you like stuff like this but i dont	16
0	movie boring story drags barely any action if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing booo	16
0	it is really just one poker player interviewing a bunch of other poker players and it is not very well done there are a couple of good tips but nothing i have not read elsewhere save your money if you are a beginner and want to learn how to play hold'em check out howard lederer 's 'secrets of no limit hold'em' \( dvd \) and phil hellmuth 's 'play poker like the pros' \( book \) more advanced players should check out david sklansky 's books	16
0	this is a perfect example of what bill hicks used to rant about mediocre hacks live forever and pollute the earth with their existence while brilliant geniuses die way too early rip bill ! i'm afraid you were right you died at 33 and andrew is still here ! get me off this planet now	16
0	this is an excellent film which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor i was very disapointed in the quality of the release the picture quality is poor inter titles appear to be missing and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on screen it 's a shame because a film like this one deserves much better	16
0	this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen it takes colossal gall \( to say nothing of immense bad taste \) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella tack on every possible bodice ripper cliche in movies then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original the acting is strictly mid 20th century nyah ha ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn i got this just to see the great luise rainer now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	16
0	i'm not a big fan of bruce campell but i was appalled while viewing this film i know it 's a b horror film but there was no orginality in this movie i know it 's suppose to be funny but come on people was it really \? the only part that was slightly funny was when campell 's wife was going after the gypsy for the first time needless to say i think it 's interesting that this movie was a book going off subject however on a late night talk show bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a pg 13 horror film i 'll conform with that	16
0	is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects	16
0	i also found this best of collection to fall very short of the best ! there are clearly many other episodes they could have and should have used and included to make this truly a best of feature the few cases they did showcase were by far not the scariest ! a definite disappointment though still a fan ! !	16
0	this dvd is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show for a best of volume i expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the dvd case advertises namely the best of and the scariest moments in my opinion this volume fails to deliver what it promises i am definitely a fan of the series and i know there are much better moments it has to offer about the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this dvd are some fairly decent examples of evp \( electronic voice phenomenon \) even though the dvd is fairly inexpensive i do n't think it 's worth the cost	16
0	how can you rate something that has n't been released \? especially since lionsgate ruined season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box the complete 5th season debbie harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted this along with many others they completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened crappy syndicated episodes this is coming from a huge w g fan or should i say k j fan	16
0	this was our first bob dvd and maybe i just chose wrong my son waited for the theme song the whole time and it never played maybe that is the norm this whole thing is kinda strange my son likes it but does n't love it i simply should have researched more	16
0	again another interesting pop corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when hollywood gives to him a free hand \( or not so much \) things go wrong is not funny wilson and stiller are n't interesting enough and the 70 's is n't a good decade to crave for with this kind of films is useful to listen to american critics they know more about their own culture than us	16
0	i was very disappointed with this second edition my daughter and i loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting the movie dragged out for the first half and just got worse during the second half i continually kept looking at the clock wondering when it would be over we only watched it once and it will go in the rummage sale later this year	16
0	i had read with delight the book called mrs frisby and the rats of nimh to my grandsons so i thought the movie would be a nice followup wrong ! it barely resembles the book and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out it might be ok for a child who has n't read the book but we were disappointed	16
0	it is not good as a mainstream movie it does not have a good plot some scenes are not relevant even as a soft porn movie it does not do a good job try watching i like to play games its a much better soft porn movie	16
0	one of the most boring dull stupid peter sellers comedies if you can find more then 2 or 3 laughs good luck i love peter sellers in the pink panther movies and he was brilliant in a great number of films but he falls far short in this one and goldie hawn is wasted totally	16
0	this has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made you have been warned	16
0	this movie has been done over and over again with different actors and by different directors but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring do n't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind buy something original or save your money	16
0	i 'd hoped to show this video in the classroom to my high school students but the sexual references are way too graphic bummer	16
0	i thought i was getting a look into jay z 's and roc a fellas world maybe a documentary i thought \? maybe a movie i thought \? instead this was the worst attempt at a movie video whatever they called it ever this thing is horrible the only good part is jay z rapping the scenarios he is in thats cool for like 2 mins at times its like a porn video i wanted to get into jiggas world but all this dvd did was make the world a worse place to live in because of how horrible it is the crap sets in again over and over all across the plate even the biggest hova fans should stay away dont buy this	16
0	i bought this because raquel welch was in it she did a good job but it 's not worth it i loss interest as sonn as i heard the guy talking about the people in the movie this dvd was dated back to the 1920s and how a movie star struggles to get his life back	16
0	this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time	16
0	what a horrific movie to gear towards children it is extremely violent and just plain creepy ! the scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so wrong i wish i could put 0 stars for this one do not waste your money on this one	16
0	the alpha version of postal inspector is of very poor video quality otherwise it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was bela 's last film under his original universal contract the stock footage of the flood is spectacular	16
0	this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours characters were n't given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that do n't make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	16
0	when this movie starts it is so dark you ca n't even see anything the only way you can know what is going on it to read what amazon tells you after that it is just stupid	16
0	bad bad bad bad acting bad writing bad directing i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting consequently since seeing this i have n't voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance it was a huge mistake by the director \( or the screen writer \) to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up or if it was meant to be it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms	16
0	really not worth the effort to find it even if george macdonald fraser was involved with the screenplay the producers chose the least best of the flashman novels to adapt they cast the wrong actor to play the role and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy not very funny slapstick comedy do n't bother searching for it true flashman fans will be disappointed	16
0	do n't know about anyone else but the dvd i purchased had lousy video the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either i know the concert was indoors but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem	16
0	i first viewed this movie on cable that same night i purchased the movie from this seller to date i have had no responses to email no communication what so ever and still have not received this tape in the mail very disappointed and not recommended to purchase from this seller	16
0	i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	16
0	this was a piece of junk trust me dont buy it ! ! biggestt disapointment ever ! if a dumb company will make a dvd of this trash why cant they make one for howard the duck \?	16
0	i was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year a third of a way through it it starting to skip and freeze i played it all the way through but took forever at the ending it was workinhg again but i missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage i guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used wo n't be doing this again !	16
0	as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is this production was a waste of time space and money everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves the acting is bad the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink which it does badly it 's not the worse movie i 've seen but it 's surprisingly close please do n't waste your time with this film	16
0	once again koch for reasons that i cannot possibly fathom assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog were n't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes i know i'm feeling large amounts of gratitude it 's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone right \? at least the copy i bought was used so koch did n't make a dime off of me anyway this is another koch release that you should definitely avoid	16
0	when you look at the cover you think it 's about a fantastic trip into a black hole and what they find inside but it is n't it 's about a nemo wannabe wanting to enter the black hole i especially did not like the ending overall i would rate it story 3 starsactors 4 starsmusic 4 starsending 0 starsoverall 2 starsi am not insulting disney i think it came out just how they wanted it to and as with most disney movies the only pg part is violence i liked the actors and the robots but other than that it is a waste of money	16
0	i collect 1950s era sci fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds unfortunately i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape the vhs version by uav entertainment \( the wade williams collection \) is much better hopefully uav will come out with a dvd version soon	16
0	jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning stolen from the real drunken master this clip is entirely unrelated to the movie and is very short buy this if you want but not because you think it has jackie in it	16
0	i ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive	16
0	i enjoyed the first saw and kinda like the second but this has got to stop no more of the cruel heartless first it was people who didn't appreciate life now it any old hasbeen or no name d talented actor i am willing to watch another saw movie only if paris hilton nicole richie and lindsay lohan are attach large boulder and drop in some in super deep quick sand	16
0	i was eager to see this movie having loved the original american werewolf movie but was sadly disappointed i did n't care at all for the characters the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen mark me off if you do n't agree i know you rude lot will anyway but that 's my story and i'm sticking to it	16
0	an even though it 's fiction the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick	16
0	remember seagal 's movie patriot where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane that was bad this one was by far the worst movie he has ever made with the dubbed in voice \( why \? \) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released	16
0	better than submerged but that 's not saying much my wife and i have seen almost all of stevies movies and next to the foreigner and submerged this movie ranks up there in the horrid category what is up with the voice dubbed over when stevie was mumbling we kept trying to guess whose voice that was \( burgess meredith the guy who played the other terminator on t2 etc \) that was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film i ca n't see why blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe maybe there are more of us die hard ss fans than i realized even so save your money do not buy rent steal vie	16
0	the only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it the writing was terrible the plot so unrealistic and the special effects horrible this is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made why haley mills agreed to star in it is beyond me	16
0	i felt a little ripped off when i got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from amazon com movie wise volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1 with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and eng subtitle amazon could have at least indicated that in the quot description quot	16
0	sorry i could n't come up with a better punchline but this movie does n't deserve any original thought or ideas maybe its because there are n't any original ideas in this movie event national lampoon used to mean funny now its french for crapola avoid this one at all costs ! ! ! watch caddyshack ii airplane ii yes even xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one	16
0	18th century opera dressed in 20th century clothe not my cup of tea	16
0	i'm not a fan of stephen king film adaptations the only one i like is carrie bec it was directed by brian depalma and featured terrific performances by sissy spacek and piper laurie cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful i could n't wait for it to end not worth purchasing okay as a rental	16
0	bad bad bad worst villan worst plot worst actors worst song nothing was good about it ! ! !	16
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
0	very short game took about 2 hours to finish it \( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it because as always their system is unavailable please try again later took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy \) as to the game you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary gameplay was average for a shooter it seems episodes basically translates to really short game which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something	16
0	after two decades since watching upstairs downstairs i rashly decided to buy the whole set ! ! ! ! as i watched the first episodes i realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me ! the melodrama was a bit vulgar and very predictable ! later episodes of the set improved but not by much ! it was like watching a biplane that did n't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway i hope you wo n't make the same mistake i did	16
0	i should have left this review a long time ago i could kick myself for buying it thinking it was a film not a religous object if you critisize this film amongst religious radicals you risk being burned at the stake an act of love to purify your soul this film as a film disregarding the topic is a dog a cheap b grade blood spurting flesh flying horror flick in aramaic with sub titles i could go on for an hour but wo n't bother	16
0	this is not a good film i wanted to like it because i love south park and i think that trey parker and matt stone are comedic geniuses while it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance overall it 's just not very funny i think i laughed twice during the whole film watch it to see the south park guys before they were stars but do n't expect much	16
0	i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i 've seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it did n't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it	16
0	some scenes are repeated from the first it is not that bad thats all i can say i think i over rated it with 2 stars too many	16
0	i seen this movie do n't buy it ! ! ! it 's not worth anything i have it on vhs boring action purchase the other three home alones they 're the best than this movie ! !	16
1	i covered a similar theme in my international relations ma whilst any programme made for tv has to be reasonable breif on the subject i found this to be a very well argued and produced programme i recomend it not so much as some dark conspiracy but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country we should question to make sure that what happens in our name is always in our interest	16
1	i saw the scene where they have lissa chained to the pool table and gagged in the basement i did n't understand most of the movie i bet kim possible ron stoppabl and rufus can deal with them	16
1	we have all of the series that have been released so far and enjoy them all this was one great show !	16
1	this is a great dvd for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not the package is worth the coin	16

1	julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a giant corporation in a court of law julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it i give this film 5 stars because julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times	16
1	this film can be interpreted any number of ways as a farce a tragedy or just plain shakespearean comedy brenda blethyn has in the past acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill	16
1	this movie is a scream ! i laughed until i thought i was going to die comedy does n't get any better than this the characters are incredible it 's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie ! do yourself a favor and watch this movie ! it 's even better the second time around	16
1	perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of our generation although i believe i was in a different state of mind when i watched this stuff in college brilliant	16
1	i was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch live 8 and certainly regretted that however i was fortunate enough to find this copy at amazon and it 's been everything i had expected and more i'm a huge pink floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances i would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation truly a must have for anyone 's collection !	16
1	i thought the first ice age was great this one is good not great they really used scrat better this time than before but the rest of the characters were not undeveloped but it just did n't have as many hilarious situations sid is as hilarious as ever but manny and diego doe n't do as much its a good fun movie but its not as good as the first one rent it though it does have some hilarious scenes	16
1	we purchased this dvd because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it 's a great supplement to reading books he loves this dvd and we love the variety in it 's approach we did n't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years	16
1	wow ! what more can i say ! just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience this is a behind the scenes look at photography it gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the shot of a lifetime i own many national geographic books but you wo n't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this dvd even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it	16
1	i loved never cry wolf ! ! ! i saw it years ago on video but can only imagine the dvd is as good or better i was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'the bear' to buy together i love anthony hopkins and the bear was one of the worst movies i have ever seen do n't let the pairing with 'the bear' scare you off never cry wolf is excellent ! sorry tony \) okay i just realized that 'the edge' was the one with anthony hopkins my apologies to the bear ! anyway get never cry wolf ! you wo n't be disappointed ! !	16
1	feeding the cat those girls shold put on a sweater love this movie 50 's detective noir set in 70 's california the beach the hospital mexico the supermarket it 's all great and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over final scene pays homage to the third man beautiful a bit of violence but that 's how i treat someone i love and i do n't even like you never seen an elliot gould movie i like more than this it 's my favorite altman as well	16
1	our one year old loves this one and so do i the music is wonderful the creative incorporation of vivaldi 's four seasons and monet 's masterpieces are entertaining and educational the children little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child we watch this one most of all the baby einstein 's that we have	16
1	my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i did n't care for the commercial either	16
1	great movie and the movie a family can set and enjoy and not worry about the next word or scene may hold	16
1	the chronological donald vol 2 was the second box of my collection after i happen collected the first one the tin box contains 2 dvd9 look very precious but the shipment made its had some ding if you like disney you do n't miss this treasures collection the dvd content very classical and a lot of fun for your children	16
1	season 3 of the l word is by far the best yet the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season and are even better than season 2 they have scaled back the sex a little bit but when they do put it in the sparks really fly i love the l word	16
1	a terrific documentary even if you have seen it on pbs you need the dvd to view the great extra material	16
1	excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda bono se entrega a su publico buen sonido buenas imagenes magnificos extras lo recomiendo dos horas de u	16
1	i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think quot the lost world quot is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie	16
1	this is a great movie that everyone should see i'm a conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie we do n't see this movies as a republicans are bad movie thats dumb this movie is just what a movie should be funny and entertaining we all love the songs because they are not only great but true too	16
1	i ca n't wait to see the original film again i remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea thus was born the inspiration for the great pc game lemmings yes i know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide nevertheless i love this movie i hope that they do n't cut the lemming sequence disney has promised a full restoration other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an arctic blizzard the hardships of an arctic existence were beautifully photographed	16
1	this is a great show and very entertaining the story is n't the greek classic but it 's a fine riff on it the songs are good and they grow on you as you watch i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character it 's just a cartoon for pete 's sake like some other reviewers i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing go the distance over the end credits but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version no importa la distancia sung by ricky martin and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money	16
1	the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a well paced and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen	16
1	i recently had a baby boy and felt a quot little quot out of shape after having him \( ha ! \) i did a search on amazon and found this video i got it in 3 days and began right away my son works out with me every day and i could n't be happier ! we both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body and i use him for the weights ! i am also learning about my baby 's development from the video it 's educational and rewarding thanks mbbb	16
1	this movie is pure fun my whole family loved it it 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour but its fun to watch we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing watch it and enjoy	16
1	i really liked this product easy to follow and you feel it everywhere i try to do it everyday my clothes are looking better on me and i have had to buy some new ones one of the best choices i ever made	16
1	this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old	16
1	finally an ab video that makes sense and works this video is truly innovative and unique imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch you have to see it to believe it ! mike griffith makes this video fun easy to follow and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete with a short amount of time and minimal equipment this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way i am a physical therapist and i use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes i have been using it myself and it works	16
1	i really enjoyed this dvd and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns the instructor actually starts with the left foot so you can follow her mirror image i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves and you will work up a sweat if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march enjoy	16
1	i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 workouts this video is incredibly challenging but i like that i can do the level 1 workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd	16
1	this is my favorite movie i like it all screenplay director actors etc believe it brilliant	16
1	i love this movie it 's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment where is the soundtrack to this movie \? \? \? \? \?	16
1	in the third season carter is finally a doctor and all hell breaks loose for the characters the season especially deals with hiv aids violence in the workplace unwanted pregnancy etc it won a lot of awards and is much fun to watch	16
1	i thought the movie was great ! nothing like the gospel to me ! ! don't compare ! billoah is sexy baby ! he played zulu ! ! \( pretty eyes \) the movie was very funny also and taught a lesson in love ! ! ! 5 star movie ! !	16
1	i watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless ! i really dont know what to think about the whole presentation the presence of chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not if what they claim about corporations is true then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another i 'll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide i had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4 the material is more plausible than otherwise	16
1	i love this film beautifully simple and human the characters are real flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them just like your own family i 've rented at least fifteen times and i never get bored of it it 's great any time of year but fantastic for the holidays	16
1	if your a pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier filmsthis deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellenthighly recomende	16
1	i have always like stephen lynch his video live at the elray was absolutely awesome i even gave one to my cousin this christmas defintely worth the price	16
1	this has to be the best of the alien films ! this film although not as scary as the original \( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien \) it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on buy the collector 's edition of the first and this and enjoy	16
1	outstanding ! i new a remastered version of ran was a must have but i did not expect to enjoy madadayo as much as i did while i agree the packaging does not protect the disks well i got lucky and had no damage i wonder how they will handle this issue if they truly only made 5 000	16
1	loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries very funny and moving yes i'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !	16
1	it 's as good if not better than volume 1 of cartoons that time forgot the episodes are a bit more wierd in this volume hope there will be a volume 3 coming out soon	16
1	i have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv i had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and i have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out the gradual awakening of young ta to which girl is truly right for him and sammy fong 's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts the ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from james shigeta to a professional dancer afterall it 's the music and the story that make this great	16
1	this movie is my all time favorite my friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over	16
1	this movie is full of memorable scenes although it 's probably been more than a decade since i last saw it it 's suspenseful without being gory the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood and even though i 'd read the book and knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat right to the finish	16
1	this film is one of my all time favorites i think it 's because these kids remind me of my friends and i as kids riding our bikes going on little adventures etc the cast is absolutely perfect wil wheaton was the best crying kid of all time with the exception of ricky schroeder in the champ lol river phoenix was excellent in this film which is an adaptation of a stephen king short story part road film part coming of age tale all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings	16
1	i like this movie a meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle but we do n't think so almost always the story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here screenplay and performance of both bill nighy and kelly mcdonald have led this movie to the excellent one ps i do n't understand why this movie is not released in japan	16
1	moving intelligent realistic not overly acted \( as could quite easily have been the case \) about a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again you see why this has happened feel sympathy and just want him to do well when the film ends a story about hope in a world with little	16
1	it is an excellent movie very well directed and the acting is superb it awakens the natural instincts of empathy compassion and love for children all over the world are the same ir respective of color or ethnicity	16

1	very good film hard hitting emotional and i'm sure some aspects really do happen \( although i have yet to witness much of it since i 've been in la	16
1	i totally love this dvd ! they really show how to do grooves not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video these are grooves you can make your own and go and dance any where with that what i think makes this dvd series totally different from the rest the moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch it goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it love it ! ! ! love it ! ! ! love it ! ! ! i am hooked on the groovaloos	16
1	i thought that this was adam sandler 's best movie he has made that he played man who 's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5 year old boy \( played by dylan cole sprouse \) i think of how the movie should 've ended real good is for sonny to have legal custody of jullian i laugh out loud when i see this movie ! ! !	16
1	one of the movies i like to watch over and over jessica tandy played a great character in this movie my order came real quick	16
1	this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it 's release it 's action packed and full of tension in it 's 90 minutes of right on time kurt russell always good does a great job and this is no exception the late great j t walsh in one of his last performances plays one of the best bad guys i ca n't recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills action and suspense i ca n't really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it did n't belong in the perfect category although maybe it should because it does answer on every call a movie to watch again and again	16
1	great movie and it was a pleasure buying it through amazon	16
1	this dvd showcases a somewhat new \( as of the 2001 recording \) sound for sade with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music however sade 's voice adapts beautifully and she is one of those singers who just does n't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous her buttery chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this dvd after a few years of owning this dvd i still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing sound and lights on this dvd i highly recommend it to add to your chill out collection no longer the jazzy sade of yesteryear the versatility of songs on this long \( almost 2 hours \? \) dvd will keep you grooving for hours	16
1	i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that 's exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would 've moved along at a better pace but still a great movie	16
1	wow ! i had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful haunting score to match i'm glad our pleas have been heard ! with new high definition equipment coming down in price i ca n't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema update is this the region 2 4 version that was released overseas \? if so we are in for a real treat !	16
1	but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one and alpha video the distributors of this classic capra movie made no attempt to clean it up here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves	16
1	this comedy like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through the characters in this film can be hated at points especially michael douglas' and matt dillon 's but there is a lighter side ! owen wilson is very likeable as dupree an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job the cast is fine and one of the strength 's in this film ! however i think it gets too serious at points this is supposed to be a comedy after all i would n't buy it but it is certainly worth renting	16
1	this movie is really cute fluffy and not too deep but really funny meg ryan is in rare form i love the scene at the sidewalk cafe	16
1	a movie to enjoy watching many times very entertaining and light	16
1	i have been waiting for this dvd to come out for a very long time ! it is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the bradley war tank it shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used even if they were not acceptable for use and the struggle of one man to do the right thing you will not stop laughing while watching this movie !	16
1	the perpetrators of a high level corporate scandal \( masayuki mori takashi shimura ko nishimura \) are pursued by the illegitamate son \( toshiro mifune \) of a low level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes but do they really sleep well \?	16
1	what an interesting collection of meditations on the stupefying musicality of glen gould this pianist is from another planet classical music has never been so exciting to a rock n' roll fan	16
1	i was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released and i was not disappointed the dancing was magnificent and it was amazing to see patrick lisa together i have to saythought for many it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife patrick because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility ! i would recommend it to all who love dance ! it is a beautiful tribute to what a person can do !	16
1	this is an essential collection for every al pacino fan in carlito s way and scarface he does one of his best work ever then there is the performance that gave him his only oscar so far in a scent of a woman if you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the al pacino collection	16

1	i loved the first one and i think with the logic and plot of the first one this follows through we knew they changed the world and in this sequel we see that the actors do a good since the lead characters are suppose to be let 's say less intelligent but nice i think this movie and the 1st one are classics i like the grim reaper his atitude during the movie and the fact the he is the comic relief \( okay so most of the movie is comic relief \) even if they are fun to watch to laugh at it is worth it to watch	16
1	i absolutely loved this dvd i saw in on tv but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes' collection i highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of superman its origins and where he fits into our culture today it 's great	16
1	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever	16
1	if you liked raise the red lantern or the last emperor this is a perfect movie gong li who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband farewell my concubine uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera which is an acquired taste this movie uses the story of a king his beloved concubine 's self sacrifice to frame the love story between two men when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman the stage is set for a tragic love triangle the final scenes are chilling powerful this is a spectacle not to be missed	16
1	this movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when i read the book even though it was made several years ago it 's still a fantastic movie timeless	16

1	there are n't enough movies like this these days family oriented \( centered actually \) adventure with edutainmental attributes great cast great score great \( albeit goofy \) story people give this film too much credit for being implausible which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true if you 're looking for adventure and fun thrilling characters in a family film this is it	16
1	at first i was skeptical about buying an aging mccartney band tour dvd even though i have every one so i bought it i watched it from start to finish unbelievably superb the lighting the energy of the band and the crowd suprising interviews ! ! and ole paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark ! after watching it i felt like i had been there it is the best one i have seen yet ! if you like mccartney this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear ! excellent buy	16

1	really does not get the film noir credit it deserves \( probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring dinah shore or other 1940 's musical starlet \) some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale gene tierney is wonderfully mercurial sometimes hot hot hot and other times just plain icy cold this was her only oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here see gene in this and in laura and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances	16

1	i was so pleased to find this movie on amazon com i had watched it as a child and pinned over it when i could not find it in stores over the years this is such a pure love story with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real there are too few unpretentious untampered romantic movies around these days most reveal too much literally but this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	16
1	most people that like wes anderson 's films are rabid fanatics and i'm no exception so when the chance came to buy his first feature length film for 7 i snapped it up if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums you 'll enjoy this on some levels too many of anderson 's classy touches are already in evidence in this film the story is fun and the characters are well developed yeah pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson 's character masterfully done even in his first role	16

1	i am saying this as an italian american myself quit bashing the show because it portrays are small portion of italian americans its a tv show and a darn good one it does not portray us all like that just this mob family so quit being so sensitive and lighten up frances and ps i do not care if this was help or not either !	16
1	i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'living in oblivion' the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener one of our most overlooked and under appreciated hollywood actresses she once again did not disappoint but the entire cast was extremely good you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason i'm glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem	16
1	i am a huge muppet fan and was very excited to have the opportunity to get a newer remastered version of this classic while the quality is not too much better than the original dvd release it is definitely worth adding to your collection especially if you do n't have any version of the movie yet !	16
1	attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini series of its day it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome gerard butler is attila the hun and he is everything about attila in this role never was an actor better suited his character is sharp passionate determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes	16
1	i'm still waiting for poldark to make it across the pond until then i 'll satisfy myself with this fine work	16
1	this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they 're idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time	16

1	i saw this movie twice the second time knowing exactly why i wanted to see it again if you are trying to find out if you love someone or not make sure that you see this movie such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives explains why we are where we are and makes you part of the harmony is love as simple as teaching someone to bike \? think about it if there are no rules against it this film should be renominated for oscar	16

1	audrey without givenchy and only a portion of her face visible few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances the depth of the movie the richness amount to a great piece of art certainly the movie is not fun but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster	16

1	my kids \( age 5 7 and 10 \) love this movie i actually bought the vhs version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the dvd so we could watch it in the car when while traveling my husband and i originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it 's nice that we can share it with our own kids now if you love animals this movie is for you the dvd jacket says this movie took a few years to make and i believe it it 's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other this has got to be one of the best animal films out there	16
1	not a fan of graphic novels or cgi i was fully prepared to dislike this movie but found it to be so well written cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection it 's a dark movie subversive really but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people that one strong person with a will determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them can turn the tide it 's a powerful message and it 's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery symbolism and script bravo	16
1	nothing beats this show archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by bravo for a reason \( edith was number 12 \) highly recommend since the re runs that are seen on various tv stations are chopped by about 2 1 2 minutes a piece	16
1	using the g8 summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed \( at least to me \) like a recipe for disaster but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem do n't miss it	16
1	i really like this dvd you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises and she moves quickly from one exercise to another i like the variety of exercises there are not too many rep 's on any one exercise which keeps the workout from being monotonous this is the first programmable exercise dvd i 've used and i like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start \( and once i start i'm fine \)	16
1	the movies of course are dated but fascinating also the picture quality was excellent as was the sound the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed now even the simplest movie regardless of the subject has an edge these horror movies of the 40s 50s are gentler less scary with a clear statement of good and evil now we view things differently without any absolute judgments clarity has given way to a more unsettled world	16
1	the freshman is a very funny movie the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed matthew broderick is the freshman an innocent nyu film student who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his family the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild bad words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families	16
1	i saw this show on logo boy i loved it i wish i was there	16
1	watching this movie is a very bizarre experience having attended high school in the countryside close to large clusters of amish farms i had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing amish teenagers i dismissed most of them as rumor this movie confirmed that those wild stories i heard were probably true a very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most americans cannot even begin to comprehend worth a rental at the very least	16
1	my six year old \( who has never been very excited about exercise \) really loves this dvd the routine is active fun and most importantly easy to learn other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered she completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning she asked to do it again ! my 2 1 2 year old has a great time dancing with us as well	16
1	house 1 is darker than it 's sequels but stll maintains the horror comedy feel throughout do n't expect to be blown away by outlandish hollywood special effects the majority of the special effects are not special but if you can get over that you 'll enjoy the movie dvd is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features i doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film i'm just happy it was released on dvd ! if you are a fan of low budget horror comedy movies this movie may appeal to you it 's no evil dead but it is an entertaining movie	16
1	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes plus an extra un aired episode the show was not only far ahead of its time but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies this dvd is a must	16
1	the incredibles together with finding nemo shrek 1 2 madagascar and the spy kids series certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking particularly the incredibles is a movie no kid \( or adult as well \) will ever get tired of watching as for the plot it is just plainly great things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle but everything will change for mr incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job my kids just love this movie \( and so do i !	16
1	great movie ! delivery of the order came in good time this 2 disc collector 's edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions	16
1	from the first time our leading characters' eyes meet you can feel the temperature rise in the room not your average sappy love conquers all type of love story this film shows the courage it takes to help love conquer	16

1	this was a subject of much conversation when i was deployed to saudi arabia and it 's still a favorite with most military and civilians in iraq ground hog day is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same until finally the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it 's the day you leave the movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique bill murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well it 's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here	16
1	leather wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper because you know a dvd makes good toilet paper \( maybe it 's why he 's so grumpy \) i would suggest purchasing it and watching it michael moore may be more to the left than some but god has n't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye \? it 's less biased than the news is he reports you decide and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion but were n't michael moore is far more honest than the republican talking heads \( rush coulter hannity \) watch enjoy investigate further	16
1	it is very nice and they delever it very fast	16

1	my dvd had english subtitles the first act is the best watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding there is so much subtlety and silent communicating no surprise since it is revealed in the booklet that jim jarmusch \( director \) created this movie around the japanese actress \( youki kudoh \) 'life is beautiful' star \( and wife of roberto benigni \) nicoletta braschi stars in the second act more great quiet acting she is a true beauty funny role by the late screamin' jay hawkins also appearing in the late joe strummer of the clash	16

1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	16
1	thank heaven for larry david and curb your enthusiam or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that was n't political except south park reno 911 which are really in a different league altogether	16
1	all things aside the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end stated this way without ruining the ending played a great part as a supporting actor his name is justin goncalves i think this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had i was particularly impressed with the part he played	16
1	this one of those movies that i can watch over and over again the story is great acting is good and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best the force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity i would love to go on a tornado hunt the special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie i would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars the loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts rent it buy it watch it ! it is well worth your time and money	16

1	simply the most entertaining mockumentary film i 've seen in years and one of the best ever the dvd is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you 'd expect jenna fischer is brilliant and james gunn is hilarious you just have to buy it to understand	16
1	maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre revolution russia the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy sentimental or even tragic	16
1	well season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line \( or the theme as many will call it \) of southpark itself since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off my interest in southpark was revisited with season 6 \( also available on dvd \) however if you like south park or love it this is for you of course without saying however if you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together but this season was good	16
1	i saw this film a few years back on tv and really enjoyed it but i notice it is presented in full screen format is this the correct aspect ratio \? i hate to buy a botched pan scan version can anyone help me out \? \? \? \? \? \?	16

1	this was a great dvd i bought it for my husband and he loved it there were a few episodes that we never saw and the outakes were really funny i definately would recomend	16
1	i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's harakiri so i bought it at amazon and watched it wow this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my 1 favorite director akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu in addition to these assets the camera is wonderful i pick this movie as one of my movies of my life tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie i like him more after seeing harakiri	16
1	the thesis of guns germs and steel gives the most logical explanation for the inequality in development in the world today not based on one group of people being inherently smarter than other groups but based on a group of people favored by their environment and other factors very interesting theory that should be given more study	16

1	notice to parents there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones adult nature a woman grows to 50 ft placing an extra strain on a strained marriage daryl hanna and daniel baldwin this is a light monster film not gory it is good for that it carries some laughs punny stuff and summer flick character no deep story folks	16
1	i saw wirey spindell in theater in new york and i thought itwas awesome ! i had never heard of it before but it is a trueendorsement of indie films if you love laughing you 'll love this movie i loved devin matthews johnson and eric mabius too they 're both so cute	16
1	supposed being victimized by local communist regime and soviet oppressors since august 1968 a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals no wonder sex is a fix for such a lucky and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with southern european rather than slavic appearance a little extended up to 165 minutes of screening romantic tale with some near porno inclusions is a bit more over positive and over entertaining than its final collapsed in well movie spirit seems being similar to a beautiful life producers or more recent one of levi 's hitler as a comedy hero of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only	16
1	this is simply one of the best detective story ever made and jerry goldsmith 's sound track \( which i also own \) is probaby the best sound track it was his favorite jack faye john are at their best	16
1	okay after reading several reviews i decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs boy did i get my moneys worth ! it was so incredibly bad that i was first cringing in horror before i started laughing the characters especially hiei were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing now i'm a die hard yyh fan but i give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch put me in a good mood for the rest of the day if you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i 'd definitely suggest buying for th he11 of it	16
1	this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	16
1	this workout is nice because it does n't mess around there are no long introductions you ca n't fast forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series \( which is all legs and hips \) are really challenging and i plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery one complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they are n't available very widespread in retail stores i also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout all in all though great	16
1	my husband received this dvd for his birthday my husband grew up with the pittsburg steelers and still today is a true fan as a family we all sat and watched this wonderful dvd on the steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much it goes back to the begining of time for the steelers it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it 's name if you love the steelers then this 2 dvd set is a must have you will not be disappointed	16

1	i liked very much these series you will enjoy every momets in this moives it is deserve a place in my collection	16
1	while i thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies all have their funny moments i still enjoy the first the best mainly because the jokes were original and fresh though it is still funny to see the strange things jim would get himself into levy as his father was a great choice this is worth the 20 dollars easy lots of laughs and plenty of gross out humor	16
1	it 's not a great movie but it 's a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it 's quirky and has some decent \( for it 's day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want \? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle	16
1	an awesome film with some suspense and raunchiness all rolled in to one	16
1	this was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again	16
1	maggie gyllenhaal played her part to perfection scarily so she 's the perfect sociopath only thinking of herself while using her daughter as well as anyone else she encounters as a foil she 's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path all in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted directed and played	16
1	i saw the original about 4 5 times from 1970 1971 this one is not much different just modestly i had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years but was unable because the studio \( warner bros \) refused to release it under any format i was thrilled that it was finally released and have since been watching it with many friends most had no idea this movie was ever out i was particularly interested in anita palenburg she has really changed over the last 38 years the content may be a bit provacative for most \( sex and violence \) but the quality are extraodinary for that era this one is a must for anyone	16
1	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	16
1	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on	16
1	the series just keeps on getting better the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television the other funny show was newhart which i cannot understand why it has not been released on dvd the whole cast just clicks i wish shows like this were still on television if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !	16
1	if you 're looking for a video that does n't take a lot of time then this is one that you should add to your collection it does n't matter if you 're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years there are two levels to suit both challenges 10 minutes is spent on abs buns amp thighs you can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes the exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles if you do this video 3 5 times a week and eat a healthy diet you 'll easily lose inches and tighten up those quot loose quot areas	16
1	my best friend got this movie at her birthday and i watch it at her house it was so funny ! ! ! ! ! ! anybody who love spongebob will love this movie ! ! ! ! ! !	16

1	i enjoyed watching queen latifah in a more mature acting but the picture quality of the dvd that i bought was terrible \( thanx to amazon \) to my surprise all the trailers quality were superb but the movie was terrible terrible and terrible to be honest the quality of the picture spoilt the fun side of the movie but still i say big ups to queen \( uyisikhokho ntombazana \) i had to use this platform although its of irrelevancy to comment about the movie format enjoy everyday like its your last	16
1	filmed at new york 's improv in 1971 we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album quot craps after hours quot however witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother 's prostitution then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come	16
1	very entertaining movie i enjoyed everything about this movie the acting the humor the singing and storyline ! also being from san diego originally it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark the hotel del coronado being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed ! no the hotel was n't the seminole ritz in florida !	16
1	this is the only movie that i really like made by woody allen but is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen	16
1	i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun filled nostalgia to purchase the entire series of the adventures of superman \( played by george reeves \) the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd 's \( i got mine all at once in a 3 pack collection saving a little \) this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series from the first episode to the last \( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves \)	16

1	i loved the book and i feel that this movie did it justice the actresses are new favorites of mine and i feel they really captured the spirit of the characters the movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century england just as the book does i would definately recommend this movie and the book	16
1	after i watched this sequel i realized it was not as good as the first but i did enjoy it	16
1	i read over some of the other people 's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it my kids ages 6 2 loved this movie from start to finish the music the characters and the story were great for the entire family i definitely recommend this movie for your family 's movie collection	16
1	the musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when i saw it for the first time my husband is no square and he enjoyed it all seniors would love to see it again the film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd	16
1	this was a delightful view into the highs and lows of courtship love jealousy and hate and what havoc can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil with the lovely backdrop of italy all is well that ends well for the characters michael keaton as comic relief is brilliant	16

1	martin short is priceless in this movie i enjoyed every minute	16

1	i found i did enjoy this movie even though the director took liberties it does n't follow so much the novel by jane austen but if you have n't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons this movie is enjoyable i gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director but did like what i saw	16
1	this is fantastic ! great music great story awesome photography ! i promise you will love this film	16

1	i really enjoyed this movie ! its not one of the best and a little cheesy ! but easy to watch and one of the funniest films ive seen him in ! just a shame he never got to show us what a good actor he could have been	16
1	i enjoyed this movie a lot hugh jackman and ashley judd are both very appealing in these roles and greg kinnear does a nice job with his as well the jerk who 's just so charming that you ca n't resist even when you know better than to fall for it ellen barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first	16
1	got this on ebay for 18 last year a great deal i am only bothering to rate this as it seems ridiculous that is rated below two other rather shoddy grant collections because of the holiday backlash objectively rating the content instead of the marketing would work for me	16
1	i love dancehall queen ! i lost my first copy \( vhs \) so i replaced it with a new copy in dvd i never get tired of watching this movie and i consider it a jamaican movie classic right up there with harder they come rockers and smile orange it is a nice twist on the traditional rags to riches story although her character 's morals are somewhat questionable \( she practically sells her daughter to a high paying local don \) you ca n't help but root for the protagonist marcia	16
1	this exhilarating musical comedy featuring \( respectively \) the fancy footwork and infectious crooning of gis kelly and sinatra perfectly captures the optimistic spirit that held sway in the post world war ii boom co starring dancers vera ellen and ann miller on the town was one of the first color films shot on location in manhattan and remains one of the grandest liveliest hollywood musicals ever made	16
1	well at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet beware the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while the dvd has a different narrator than the original \( neal morrissey \) videos but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s	16
1	mathau and lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like grumpy old men the plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship	16
1	the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not a 5 is because not everyone will be happy with all 5 films in this collection point blank is that this a must get you cannot beat the price for a good selection of quality american films very satisfied	16
1	5 classic films by one of the best african american directors of all time for 20 00 ! if you think this isn't a great deal than obviously there is a problem ! mo betta blues is one of the most well put together pieces and if you enjoy the films i suggest listening to the actual soundtracks	16
1	i was delighted to see more than one shower scene all natural different body types you will not be disappointed	16
1	this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox \? \?	16
1	this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing	16
1	both movies are great each one of them has it 's own charm ashley judd shows she is a great comedian and hugh jackman is one of the best actors of his generation the movie is soo funny it shows what we women are like when a man breaks up with us and that love is where you least expect it as for brown sugar it 's very sweet entertaining and funny to watch i did n't know the actors of this movie and they are amazing perhaps love is next door	16
1	this collection brings together five of the older british war stories and is excellent value for anyone who enjoys such movies	16

1	i enjoyed high anxiety very much i happen to be a fan of mel brooks and all his movies it was entertaining and funny i would suggest it to anyone	16
1	english humor is famous for it 's eccentricities but with the exception of selected monty python you need the english pedigree to really like it the young ones pick up where monty left off outrageous yet real there is a plot line but it does n't get in the way it 's a shame there were n't more episodes made	16
1	the best cleopatra that the movies has ever produced be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part so many came before and so many after elizabeth taylor however to me cleopatra will always be elizabeth taylor a mega movie with fantastic costumes and acting is a classic in historic movies if you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection	16
1	pro great story teriffic acting beautiful settingcon some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the wholelindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character 's lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film	16
1	loved them all found victoria amp albert and lorna doone a bit lacking wondered about having more of the scarlet pimpernel offered he 's so smooth ! tom jones is very special loved sophie 's father he truly made the film as much as i liked him hated lizzie 's mother in p amp p what a ninny ! this is a great collection would have liked to see vanity fair and persuasion offered also	16
1	my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter ca n't get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it	16

1	this is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor it is also a story of cross cultural misunderstanding of the highest order kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part the scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema the cinematography and editing are a masterpiece unforgettable	16

1	this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	16

1	with king creole love me tender and stay away joe jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look especially how the choreography should be executed in this film we see elvis presley at his very best he was a stunning actor much more prefer him to james dean it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best it isn`t a classic it isn`t even great but we have elvis the king and that`s the best there is \) \)	16
1	one of the best new sitcoms in recent years up until i got the dvd i had no idea bob saget was the narrator neil patrick harris is very funny as barney \( who names thier kid that these days \? \) and basically makes the show what it is legendary !	16
1	new york city the two disc set special edition should be added to your collection this movie rule	16
1	the magnificent frame employment accent even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed country arrested for an unexplained crime he is never told about the unbearable tension joins with bureaucratic struggle to involve us in a nightmare of uncalculated magnitude anthony perkins' emotive memory after psycho fit with adjusted accuracy a magnificent cast headed by jeanne moreau akim tamirof elsa martinelli and welles too a fundamental icon of the cinematography footnote it should be known that a special request of welles around a documental that included at least some shots of the atomic bomb were totally denied to him something similar happened with kubrick when he asked for flight sequences of the b 52 in dr strangelove	16
1	this is a great movie especially if you like quot dancehall queen quot paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching	16
1	the documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots however it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different nato countries the actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered morethe presentation both the picture and sound are top notch we found out that not every dvd system can read the imax presentation	16
1	love this movie ! ca n't decide which version i like better this one or the one with grace kelly and bing crosby ! both are great	16
1	in this movie we once again see mad max \( sans hot car \) wandering around in a post apocalyptic world until he discovers bartertown in the wasteland mel gibson tries valiantly to channel such on screen loners as clint eastwood and john wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social skills however he becomes a threat to the matriarch of the town by the name of aunty emteevee \( or something like that \) then mel kicks a lot of butt in the process this is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the outback opal mining town of coober pedy which i visited a few years ago	16
1	this movie is good fun the sound track is excellent does anyone know how i can get a cd sound track of this movie \? send info to geraldkalisik hotmail co	16

1	swiss austrian actor von sydow verygood and look for john wayne as ro man soldier who uses title line	16
1	when i read the reviews i thought that maybe i should n't see the movie but i was desperate to rent it since dmx was in it when i finished watching the movie i thought that the people were full of crap this movie was a great example of real life and it had a very good touching end	16
1	this set is fine as far as it goes however where are the strawberry blonde and the oklahoma kid \? warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets why not cagney \? on the other hand maybe a cagney volume 2 is in the works let 's hope so	16
1	funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block \( region 1 \) is n't really present i took the shot to order this and unlock my dvd player if i had to \( i live in amsterdam region 2 \) but i did n't have to ! ! this dvd is region free ! thanks amazon but in future it would be nice to provide correct region information i bet that a lot european \( and perhaps australian russian and so on \) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region regard	16
1	great movie with great sound and visuals what it on a hd tv and get blown awa	16
1	as any visual footage on ike tina turner is pretty scarce i guess we may be thankful for this great dvd their 1971 show being integrally covered by dutch television it reveals ike tina supported by a pretty good band and last but not least by the marvellous ikettes all this at a time their performance must have been at its very peak	16
1	this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie it has laughter suspense compassion and innocense the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger hidden dragon an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection	16

1	this movie classic is a fabulous movie the story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants here is this sensitive kind hearted fellow marty a butcher who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life especially his mother and his aunt these two actors play their character parts perfectly just like real battle axes from the old country etc they gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met it is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life i love watching this movie over and over	16
1	i really really like this piece of film rated pg 13 for stylized action violence good for anyon	16
1	i loved this movie it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie	16
1	i'm not usually a ballet person i have n't seen anything since the nutcracker when i was six but this was absolutely brilliant the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop \? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet	16
1	this movie has more magic than a wand this movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs young jessica is so sure that this reindeer is prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend sam elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm this a wonderful classic for the young and old	16
1	exactly what i thought i was purchasing shipped quickly definately would recommend this seller	16
1	the movie is excellent i was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage but the regular dvd is excellent as well not many additional features but the movie is delightful and although slightly longer then some holds the viewers interest minor amounts of nudity some very graphic fist fighting but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot one of ron howard 's best films	16
1	these films used to be on tv all the time i was amazed at how clever the plots were i did n't remember some of them weird woman is my favorite b film and i'm always recommending it to people movies used to be so entertaining ! it 's great to have this collection available to film fans we can overlook chaney 's stiffness as the rest of the cast really compensates for it	16
1	i own both the ultimate editon and the extreme dvd i want to say that you can play the theatrical version on your t v with the two disc extreme special edition on your menu on disc it should say play special edition hit right four times and the future is not set should be highlighted push enter and you should see play theatrical version on your menu i am a little dissipointed that when i bought the extreme dvd at best buy it did not have a metal case either way i love t2 it 's a classic that never gets old	16
1	i really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line	16
1	i really enjoyed this movie not the typical john boy movie i have not seen the original although i have recently purchased it i will be able to make a better comparison once i have seen it by itself however it holds it 's own	16
1	those who hunt elves is worth the buy you wo n't regret it	16
1	pretty good ! my brother is a huge elmo fan and he loves the elmos world dvd`s ! this is his fourth favorete one ! he watches it almost every two days	16
1	craig is one of the funniest comics that i have ever seen he has one the funniest standup routines that i have ever seen i guess that is why he was voted comedian of the year	16
1	this movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made you will laugh all the way thru it and enjoy when things were so much simplier in hollywood	16
1	ed friedlin is a monthly writer for bass player magazine he covers in an excellent way how to slap pop mute develop a groove how to play with drum machines ghost notes and does some licks in larry graham louis johnson and marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner very good instructional video	16
1	this is one of my all time favorite vampire movies the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice 's interview with the vampire the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through and the cinematography is lush and sensual evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire and her famous line i want some more has been rendered immortal in movie history the chemistry between lestat cruise louis pitt is believable and in fact they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie all in all a cinematic treat	16
1	simply the most classic surf video ever ! certainly a must have for any respectful surfe	16
1	one of the best films of all time ! fans of katharine hepburn and cary grant are in for a treat with this one	16
1	i thought this was an amazing movie it hit close to home with me i love jennie garth as she is an amazing actress this movie was certainly one you could sit down with your family and watch without worrying about language or violence this movie inspired me to buy more like it	16
1	this was a very interesting movie a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key i think i liked the skeleton key better but this was still a really good movie there are a few scenes with nudity in it not a movie for the youngsters we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	16
1	this movie was one of the most honest accurate portrayals of how to play the dating game i have ever seen i liked it so much i bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers ignore the tacked on hollywood ending	16
1	for sheer excitement you cannot beat this dvd the music is exciting arranged well for brass ensemble and recorded with high quality but that 's only the beginning in blast the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform how they manage this energy level will flat out amaze you i can honestly say that after just seeing these performances you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be prepare to be thrilled	16
1	do n't discount this film because you are dismayed by tom cruise this film is excellent and a must see the symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look attempt to ignore good old tom and rekindle your love for him pre insanity kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie as he should	16
1	i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career i think he probably knows that he is a living joke i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i 'd say hes done that	16
1	this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it 's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you do n't that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended	16
1	the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period there 's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done doris and perry como 's duet together was ok \( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him \) doris day has always been under rated as a singer her voice is sheer perfection it 's too bad that doris did n't do more specials or have a variety comedy musical show like carol burnett	16
1	we caught this movie on pbs when it first came on and my daughter was hooked it 's a change from the regular arthur animation this one is computer animated she was very intrigued by that fact and then the story is about a puppy well there you go ! the story is well written a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after pal there are even a few catchy tunes as well highly recommend this to every arthur fan out there	16
1	i did not think that the women juliet lewis plays in this movie was mentally retatrted i think she just has a disablity i hate that lable if someone can walk and talk and learn i do n't think so	16
1	the wolf man legacy set a no brainer like all the classic universal legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone jack pierce 's make up and wolfman creation are still the best ! this set along with dracula and frankenstein legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with you still need abbott and costello meets frankenstein to truely complete the series	16
1	i do n't understand why there are so many low reviews here this movie was one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen also it was very unique i think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life this movie is fiction all the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what 's real about this movie and just sit back and laugh this movie was extremely funny ! !	16
1	the story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with mitchum in one of his nastiest roles it 's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in cape fear he meets his match in lillian gish 's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is sweet in fact the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film charles laughton in his only stint at directing does an excellent job but i think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension a very good example of film noir	16
1	this movie helps brings to life what you have read in the bible about john and future world events you must see this movie	16
1	this is not a chick flick movie this is not a movie for baseball fans this movie is for everyone it has romance it has sports it has a great soundtrack it makes you laugh it makes you cry it makes you think it is a feel good movie	16
1	this is a wonderful show and very true to the band 's recent live performances albeit with a condensed songlist i give it only 4 stars because i had the pleasure of seeing mr winwood and band live and the sound stage gig seems just a tad below that experience which is admittedly an unfair comparison nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso \( actually a band of virtuosos \) consider it 4 5	16
1	i highly recommened these dvd 's ! how exciting and refreshing it is to pop in a dvd and go back in time to the 1970 's again ! its wonderful to rewatch such a a classic piece of tv ! truly worth adding to your collection	16
1	this is a fantastic version of taming of the shrew for anyone who is interested in really studying the text \( and hearing it spoken correctly \) this is the version for you ! the actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying \( yipee ! \) they also have an uncanny way of speaking the speech which gets it across to the audience as clear as day you dont need to understand 'shakespearean verse' to see this performance the actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast which i belive they are !	16
1	treasure island has that magical touch to it walt disney was famous for treasure island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem lots of good guys and bad guys and pirate treasure leads to a wild ride ! this film should be required for all youngsters ! there is a special place in my heart for this film this was robert newton 's finest hour playing long john silver	16
1	it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film had he lived the crow sequels would have been much better the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 's	16
1	i ordered this movie for my husband he loves it ! it 's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over no big plot but it 's got it 's moments i'm quite sure there is something for every european to be offended by so keep a sense of humor and enjoy	16
1	excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most african american families really are big mama 's are always the most important component to a family definitely a collector 's item	16
1	my 11 year old saw this movie at school and would n't stop talking about it or asking for it since we could n't find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was ! ! part of his christmas present he loves it this movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others	16
1	this movie has a lot of meaning behind it the actors put on a really good show movie is lacking special effects but that does not hurt the quality in any way story keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways	16
1	great movie for all ages our family realy enjoyed this movie highly recomend	16
1	the concert in central park is not only the best of simon garfunkel 's concerts it is one of the best of anyone 's concerts in my estimation the crowd was really in to it and simon and garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music and the era it was written in i have owned the vcr tape for years and enjoyed it many times but the signal was beginning to fade so i was very pleased to see it released on dv	16
1	this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd this is identical with the vhs version except it adds two features the first is an excellent making of video from 1996 which was re done with a different host for 2006 but all the interview segments are the same the second was a making of video done for the dvd which does n't add a whole lot were i to do it again i 'd buy this version and skip the 2006 50th anniversary release this is the classic chuck jones television grinch in one of the best packages for it and the horton hears a who is also a chuck jones classic a person 's a person no matter how small	16
1	i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film 's power as a period piece but it totally did n't it was seamless i will buy this for my home collection i have always loved kirsten dundst 's work and this is no exception	16
1	my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she 's adopted max as an imaginary younger brother there 's no flash and no dash no special effects and no tired slapstick but there is charm gentleness intelligence humor and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward and she 's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it ages 18 months through five five stars and then some	16
1	timeless classic movie 2 of the songs are frequently re done by various artist	16
1	this is something that both my husband and i love to watch we ca n't wait until season comes to dvd	16
1	my sister and i loved this show growing up \( the huxtables reminded us of our extended family ! \) the episode where stevie wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes \( in my opinion \) i do question why in amazon 's list of actors at the top of the page \( for the season 2 set \) joseph c philips is the only one listed although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later regardless this is a great collection and a must for cosby fans	16
1	as promised this product was sent brand new and arrived quicker than expected my brother loves soccer and thoroughly enjoyed this as a present for christmas	16
1	wow how nice to watch sam cooke 's story from beginning to end interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information i never knew sam 's father was a chicago minister and of course sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang ! unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early after watching this dvd i bought sam cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs i had no idea sam wrote	16
1	i really enjoyed this dvd the instructor is very charismatic unlike most instructional videos he really knows his stuff the only reason i would n't give it 5 stars is because i do n't believe that any dvd or video can really train a person to play an instrument it comes from personal experience not formula	16
1	i echo most of the previous reviews this hayley mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent mary stewart novel that it shares some of its title with hayley was too young to be the novel 's heroine and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened' sanitized \( though the novel 's romance was also chaste \) and also very much dumbed down as a featherweight hayley mills film this is harmless and very much a lesser disney film of the 60s just do n't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it even with your kids of today as a retro laugh	16
1	in 2 weeks i will actually be at the vatican for my first visit this wonderful dvd showed me places and things that i will never be able to see as a tourist but just knowing about the workings of the vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit this is a beautifully done 90 min dvd as only national geographic could have done i was thrilled with every minute i spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when i get home to remember my trip	16
1	i have always liked this movie along with the horror there 's some comedy thrown in	16
1	my whole family \( ages 7 68 \) greatly enjoyed all the horatio hornblower movies together they are well made and great entertainment a very acessible way to learn about the napoleonic wars it gives the viewers a real sense of how highly held personal honor and integrity used to be we ca n't wait for a e to continue the series	16
1	together with 'odyssey into the minds eye' two of my favorite dvds in my collection they may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track there is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions	16
1	one of the warmest most pleasantly lip smacking film 's ever ! made by a guy with a super sized heart america is a joyouscelebration of the burger and the down home folks who createsome of the most wonderfully odd versions of it take it fromsomeone who has the hamburger america poster hanging up thislittle treasure is a home library essential	16
1	i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	16
1	i have watched this film on my local pbs station at least 1 2 dozen times because it is soooooo good i have a mental vacation each time i find that my stress just goes away while watching this awe inspiring movie i highly recommend this film for the whole family	16
1	this movie was very hard to find found it in dvd an it was new	16
1	its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word this is a great film to throw on relax and absorb	16
1	really delightful and has stood the test of time my recording had a few hic cups with the lighting in one of the acts music lovely as were the costumes and scenery can recommend	16
1	after many years of sleeping in his coffin the vampire lestat awakens only to find that the world has changed and he wants to be a part of it he gathers a following and becomes a rock star only to find that his music awakens the ancient queen akasha and she wants him to become her king worth at least a rental !	16
1	having only seen seinfeld 's series on tv that goes by the same name it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on dvd i 'd never seen the dvd before but some of the material sounded familiar perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the seinfeld show \? you may notice that in his speel about the chinese he lets the word shovel out too soon \( when talking about the chinese 's perseverance with chopsticks \) and thus spoils the joke a little bit but seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib so he managed to work around it a thoroughly recommendable dvd	16
1	noel and liam and jarvis are f king hilarious damon needs to off himself same with the weirdo journalist with the upper class accent this video is good at making britpop seem like an actual period in music hahahahaha whatever besides everyone knows radiohead and prodigy were quite accepted in the u s and were very original oasis is an awesome lethal rock n roll band anyone who loves rock n roll have to love oasis do n't cheat yourself	16

1	shel natowsky ph d this movie is costner 's best without any hesitation the performances by hackman and sean young are also flawless supporting roles are well honed as well the movie has everything you could want in a film i mean everything ! the screenplay is wonderfully written acted directed and presented why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore \? everytime i run it it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me if you want to see a cold war drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever 's pace then see this one satisfaction guaranteed ! well done people	16
1	you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut but it 's actually the opposite i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people this movie is the real thing i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too	16
1	whether you 're greek or whatever just about anyone can relate to toula 's life after having deemed herself hopeless for thirty odd years then finally meeting the man of her dreams toula 's real obstacle is surving her family ! while his parents are quiet and typical americans toula 's clan embraces their roots telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories roasting a lamb in the front yard gramma in the old country babushka you 'll laugh til you cry 'cause chances are you know someone exactly like each of toula 's relatives	16
1	a musician 's story all factual and carefully done showing a gathering of cuban jazz greats after many years of not performing good photography interesting scenes and good music they still play ! well done	16
1	hard to believe it took me until now \( february 2007 \) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award deserving back in the early 80 's i loved this movie it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting especially tony montana a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is \( over 2 hours \) everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime it wo n't disappoint the ending gave me goosebumps it was that good and intense watch it now	16

1	all the danger man dvds are excellent the shows are extremely thought provoking and are much more enjoyable if viewed giving time for some entertaining analysis that almost always occurs when i put these on any fan of mcgoohan british tv or tv with some intellectual bite to it will enjoy this series	16
1	this little girl lives by herself its wild how she lives and what out for that white powder ! mario is her only friend and trap door is a goner	16
1	i was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by cat stevens \( his name then \) i was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection i was and still am a fan of his music nice to see a dvd concert of his it is old music but if you 're a fan of the man you 'll enjoy it	16
1	this movie is an action mystery space love story with a lot of interesting charecters and you really get into it there is little swearing and half a second of nudity which does n't show anything but somebodies backside i would recomend this movie the ending is a surprise and there is cool plot twists	16
1	the devil 's backbone is a horror movie like you 've never seen before a good and intelligent one it really is not a horror movie however but a story which involves ghosts \( or the past \) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions it is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you worth seeing	16
1	the performance given by poitier will not dissappoint this movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother lena this work is timeless	16
1	the first wayne 's world provides all the necessary background but number 2 is actually better because it has a longer list of interesting cameo appearances including starkly realistic versions of jim morrison and sammy davis jr spoofing the oliver stone film jfk in the desert	16
1	one of the last good comidies that isnt outragously stupid	16
1	this is a well written thoughtful film charlie hunnam \( pete \) really stands out to me he 's perfectly cast compelling to watch and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his mates it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood 's character evolve the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must see	16
1	this movie showed what an amazing dancer gene kelly was this is one movie i recommened for anyone who loves the world of dance thinks gene kelly is hot \( lol \) or if you love musical theater	16
1	in this cynical day and age it 's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant \( not to mention amazing \) but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage \? this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls' early years and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea it 's all things to all people but it 's never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it 's a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings	16
1	that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked i am very glad that i did it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david 's nice tush in the movie if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life you will get a hoot out of this one	16
1	if you have n't seen this you should great movie never get tired of seeing it i think any age could watch this	16
1	i used to watch dinosaurs as a kid but now that i'm older i get the more adult jokes that are in the series and the underlying political and social statements being made in each episode it brings back old memories of my childhood i love it !	16
1	this is an amazing dvd i read reviews online all the time saying anyone will like this but seriously i even showed it to my mother who laughed that 's a big deal this dvd follows these four comedians on their two week tour their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city also throughout the episodes it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in america during her time of need interpersonal relationships and anything else they could think of this dvd makes me laugh to tears every time literally	16
1	this is a must own film ! i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end daniel berhardt is god	16
1	good actors great story some good action too this is great movie to help put together the bits and pieces of the stories you 've heard about wild bill hickok calamity jane and more it all may be true history it may be fictional it may just be myths mixed with fact but whatever the case there 's more truth than not in this version of the 1870'	16
1	i first saw this movie when i was a kid it left a good impression i am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me my first female cat i named it mewsette in honor of judy garland 's character in the movie i then searched for the movie on the internet found it bought it while it 's not as good as it was when i was a kid it is still amusing	16
1	this film i have to say is beautiful looking from the characters to the landscape although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects the only problem is the love between the two main characters the movie never lets you feel the love between them and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right \? the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals !	16
1	my 2 yr old son has watched this dvd again and again he 's not into cartoons so the real life airplanes trains and buses suit him perfectly	16
1	p d james' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment this cd featuring roy marsden as adam dagliesch is excellent it has well developed characters a complex plot involving actions that took place years before and scenes in both london and on england 's coast i highly recommend this product	16
1	really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of budd boetticher the collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special	16
1	a very well done and most interesting film on a very intelligent animal the dolphin it is perfect i'm buying copies to give to my friends	16
1	i bought the homecoming 3 4yrs ago and i watch it every year at christmas i found it on the floor in my house after hurricane katrina still in the package it came in i brought the dvd to my new place of residence and popped it in the player and it has been playing since i found it when ever i'm down it watch it so i can relieve some of my own childhood memories of the season it is a must see for the young and old	16
1	this movie is very simple and unique it 's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you 're watching because it does n't feel phony this can be credited to the acting the situation and the plot as well this is n't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her that 's all been done and that 's what makes this film a breath of fresh air river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many and really allows you to connect with his character i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art and be touched at the same time	16
1	this movie is great ! very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud love it	16
1	if your a fan of progressive rock you probably already know how good this cd is in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time \( followed closely by operation mindcrime any of the great pink floyd and rush records \) my only complaint on this dvd is the sound i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great somewhere it did n't transfer to the recording it is not the worst thing i have ever heard but it does n't show the bands power live every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price i would not want to be with out it	16
1	this movie has the best opening scene ever ! it 's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh highly recommended	16
1	i loved this film the writting story special effects acting and directing exceed the original i recomend this film to any fan of the genre	16
1	as socrates once said i drank what \? frank bigelow \( edmond o'brien you may remember him as winston smith in `1984' 1956 \) realizes after he had a one night fling that he does not feel so good he feels bad enough to see a doctor yep he is d o a \( dead on arrival \) as he has been poisoned and only has a little time left to live obsessed with finding out who did it and why frank has to reconstruct his wild night will he find out in time \? if so what then \?	16
1	this dvd version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable hayley mills is her usual irrepressible self and the supporting cast is top notch the feline actor in particular ! \) i do n't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format it did n't bother me at all disappointment i could understand but this kind of vitriol \? it 's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages and i found it a refreshing change from the dumbed down kid 's movies they tend to make these days adults will enjoy the suspenseful story retro style and feline antics just as much as kids will i 'd skip the remake and get the original	16
1	about time urban works brings back the cosby show but i wonder what happened to a different world after the release cancellation of season 2 \? if any worker of urban works reads this please reply ! ! ! !	16
1	this movie was always a fun one to watch however after katrina in new orleans it was the best comic relief on those days when it was all going wrong as we rebuilt the house love the movie	16
1	this is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is seriously flawed tom hanks and shelly long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this	16
1	first i thought i bought it for my great old days but it 's not i really love it and i ca n't stand watch it and watch it again ! ! hi studio would you please release the 2nd season ! ! almost 2 years waiting \? o come o	16
1	clarification after reviewing the set and then receiving the set i must applaud a amp e for the brilliant 20 minute behind the scenes special on the 5th disc ! finally the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet 's heads ! also on disc 5 they did include the lost footage from the 40th episode ! bravo	16
1	these shows do n't date they are as fresh as they were over 30 years ago these shows deserved all the emmys they received a must see series i'm glad they are finally releasing them i would prefer more extra features though more show commentary would be nice as well	16
1	i 'll make this short and sweet this is by far the best bond movie of them all imho excellent work by connery and the rest of the cast	16
1	there are two story lines here one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of title ix 's beneficial impact and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of title ix 's less beneficial side effects heartbreak fury exultation are the viewer 's rewards only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner	16
1	a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer strong singing cast with excellent voices a must see	16
1	this is a great collection i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy but my son is hooked on it now too	16
1	it 's just like the hit tv show ! in fact they probably got the idea for the tv show from this movie actually i thought it was more of a comedy than anything i saw it on the we network it 's worth the price if you feel like buying it	16
1	i gave my boyfriend the most romantic presents ever for valentine 's day but this is still the one he talks about the most he loved having all the seasons and this was the best price i found anywhere	16
1	it 's a funny concept to begin with and stiller is hilarious then you throw in rip torn \( probably the best film judas among his many credits over the years \) and these cameos that are out of control \( shatner armstrong norris \) and you 've got a comic classic	16
1	a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity as a big fan of greer garson i must comment on jane bedinger 's review in which she claimed that ms garson was having an affair with the actor who played her son ms garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made i do n't see how ms bedinger could consider this an affair	16
1	well almost the seats were good and i drank straight out of the bottle the dvd was n't what i thought i had purchased but i'm not at all unhappy about getting it very very very good quality audio video and i do n't mind watching it often	16
1	this is one of the best semi futuristic movie ever and for all you shadowrun lovers out there this movie has the same type of erie ness and finess to it by far keanu reeves' best performance to date	16
1	either you get on the train or you do n't and as long as you continue to get on the train you 'll grasp the meaning of christmas the true meaning of christmas but you have to be willing to get on this movie was a great adaptation of the classic story i must admit i was a tad bit wigged out by the animation it was just oogey in some ways realistic at times and at other times so unbelievably fake i could n't decide if i liked the animation or not still ca n't but the story itself is worth the struggle i had with the animation get on board ! you 'll be glad you did	16
1	the third movie has nothing to do with book 3 if you loved the books you will find this movie completely unbelievable kirk cameron should be ashamed of himself for being in this piece of garbage the first two movies are pretty well fdone and true to the books	16
1	i bought this for my 3yr old twins and from the first showing i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales so they really loved the three little pigs and the pied piper i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children	16
1	wonderful i forgot how many great songs they have	16
1	edmund o'brien is a cpa who decides to get away to san francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats \( and also to get away from his secretary who 's nagging him to marry her \) there he 's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live he tries to find out who poisoned him and why the trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing following this trail is a bit confusing for o'brien and the audience but the picture is tightly directed and well acted a highly regarded film noir entry and rightly so worth a watch	16
1	this dvd of the wiggles is my 21 2 year old grandsons favorite he watches it every day and never tires of it i enjoy watching it with him the wiggles are great entertainment for people of all ages i do n't think you can go wrong with the wiggles	16

1	this movie was probably the best one next to lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi wish maker pokemon ranger centers around the legendary pokemon manaphy and of course ash and his friends some new and amazing characters include buizel jackie the ranger mantyke and chatot the annoying but funny pokemon the villian is great the ending is amazing and the effects were the best yet	16
1	this video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners i started taking a vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so i looked for a video to supplement my practice at home what a great choice baron baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home i highly recommend this dvd	16
1	ok this definately looks very promising i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago it was good if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector 's edition box set of the older series should be better i am going to purchase this soon once i purchase it i will let you know how good it really is i 'll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series goddess anjanee	16

1	i found this movie delightful from the storyline directing and photography to the actors ! i especially loved the performances of timothy bottoms and chloris leachman ! it 's an enlightening movie that makes an important point sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all	16

1	beware ! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer \( not the reviewer 's fault \) this is instead the movie version of return to treasure island and the tv version is by a different distributor	16
1	great movie and musical numbers courtesy of quincy jones and the wonderful cast	16
1	they do't make musicals like this anymore well they do n't really make musicals anymore do they \? they used to make them made them well and they came out like down argentine way the plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright costumes lavish and not a few laughts the major players betty grable and don ameche are as engaging as usual carmen miranda makes her us film debut and sings dances and mispronounces her way to stardom the 20th century fox role players appear \( charlotte greenwood j carrol naish henry stephenson \) and add to the fun	16
1	this is a great dvd collection of a great show i hope that they follow up this set and the christmas set with another 3 disc set of shows as great as this set is it just left me wanting more i hope they deliver there are still many many classic episodes left to be seen it was worth every penny	16
1	i love this movie it is a comfort movie for me as this was one of my favs as a kid and i still love it today	16
1	great to own such a john candy dan akroid classic not recommended for children quite a lot of profanity	16
1	i will make this short aykroyd candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious the story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction his relatives decide to join him without letting him know the relatives are totally diffre n't from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot i say get this movie because everyone i know who has seen it all say the same thing i love that movie it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen	16
1	this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man at first the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters but the series remain true to the comics the story lines they took from the comics were done very well like episodes involving the silver surfer	16
1	i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who 've never seen his work i will use this collection in future presentations that i 'll make to my students as a professor every person in broadcasting should buy this collection and watch it to get a great look at the man who innovated our business	16
1	this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals so if you 're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view five on the black hand side and breathe in the culture	16
1	i wish the ones with lex barker would become available i think lex was the best looking tarzan although johnny was still good a good watch although i say again lex is better	16

1	based on a true story and a book called evidence of love this tv movie is made remarkable by the emmy winning performance of barbara hershey she is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex lover 's wife in a self defensive rage hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage brian dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament the movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for ms hershey 's dynamic presence	16
1	this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 's they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show they go through all their classics and then some whether it 's stray cat strut gene and eddie or rumble in brighton what you see and hear on this disc is flawless must buy for all music fans not just fans of the cats	16
1	this is an excellent film a lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at hbcu 's ! ! ! ! as a matter of fact the issue of lightskinned vs darkskinned is still going on today on a college campus or not spike lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time he is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the african american community i highly recommend this film if you have n't seen it get the dvd it 's a classic	16
1	i loved these movies and i cant wiat for the third one ! very funny not suitable for chilren	16
1	i would recommend this mel brooks movie if you 're in the mood to see slapstick comedy with many popular comedic faces you 'll come away repeating some of the catch phrases and dialog i first saw it when it came out and still laugh when i see it mel brooks is a genius	16

1	if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and does n't do bad at all at the acting thing	16
1	i'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble story line shmory line this is an action movie i watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion kind of a heartbreaking movie though because he 's dead no matter what the man ca n't sleep or he slips in a coma going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her that 's a film you wo n't regret owning this i promise you p s it is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies that is all	16

1	this is the third dvd from shawn trautman that i have gotten \( swing and cha cha are the others \) and they are all exceedingly well done they start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow by the time it 's over you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor it will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps you wo n't feel intimidated i highly recommend it	16
1	this is a fantastic movie ! the acting is superb and it keeps you guessing until the end nicole kidman deserved her oscar	16
1	burt lancaster stars in this tough grim noir drenched prison flick in which a sadistic prison guard \( a young hume cronyn \) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation the film 's liberal message butts up against its obligatory quot crime never pays quot ending the convicts are sympathetic but doomed from the word quot go quot a little stagey and lurid but overall tense and suspenseful the ending is a real nail biter recommended	16
1	this video is awsome if you dont like this video then you can't be t true pantera fan it doesnt get any better than this except for live watch it go ! ! !	16
1	they do n't make films like this today it 's a scathing smart funny and thought provoking look at tv news but more importantly it 's a great film about complicated people and their relationships	16
1	set two is really season three \( set five is season one \? \? \) and all the murders are excellent !	16
1	it 's always a pleasure to watch sabicas play this dvd is always a pleasure to watch you can never get tired of it it 's pure flamenco and proper setting well done as always sabicas is on top of things	16

1	i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book but it 's not as bad as i remembered some episodes are actually incredibly funny the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie and have her come between joey and ross also the whole story line with rachel 's infatuation for joey could 've been better executed or should n't have been there at all it got bad towards the end but i'm not disappointed the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends	16
1	style salsa exerciselevel very fitthis is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market it is a salsa style exercise dvd it contains pure ny shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps it is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market this dvd is made more for the serious salsa dancer who is already fit for people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start i must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd it is very fast paced buy lisa 's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd	16
1	this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it 's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one	16
1	stay tuned is about roy and helen knable roy gets a new tv from mr spike the new tv has 666 channels that 's filled with shows such as facts of life support 30 something to life sadistic hidden videoes murder she likes and commerical parodies roy and helen has 24 hours to live through hell 's channels will they make it out alive \? stay tuned	16

1	as i went through music school in the eary fifties i was confronted with lenny now at 72 i still have this pleasure there are people in the nyp that are legendary as are the performances this set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time i have left it is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future bob allshouse from the dana school of music 1952 57	16
1	these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is dated but the performances easily shine through not quite as well played recorded or filmed as bernstein 's many later unitel films but still well worth the investment i wo n't spend time on details but rest assured it 's all great stuff !	16
1	this was the first dvd i purchased after i bought my dvd player \( i know it took me a while to get one \) i had never seen the movie before but amazon com reccomended it so i took the chance it had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance it 's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old boy and girl are best friends girl likes boy but boy likes a different girl boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl boy realizes he 's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving	16
1	the book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game the information is well presented and the cd is a nice addition but really i think counting the the tempo timing to yourself would be more effective at least that worked better for me	16
1	there 's too much drama going on in this discussion ! i do n't really care about what year these episodes came out or that there are 9 missing episodes of the new scooby doo movies i'm just glad there 's more scooby ! !	16
1	it is not much live color is to dark and 2 songs are missing 16 17 \( kalimba de luna \) go bey boney m gold 20 super hits it is the best	16
1	the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie \? about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick	16
1	sure the pacing is slow compared to today 's hyper cyber entertainments but antonioni 's visuals are still incomparable scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a matisse canvas and the final shot is a stunner lovely achingly felt picture	16
1	like stuart gordon 's other venture into science fiction territory the underrated and ill fated robot jox this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience everyone joins in the fun in this one with dennis hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog debi mazar and stephen dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and charles dance having the time of his life with his horny half metal madman this excellent dvd offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the director	16
1	it is a well made movie based on a great book i was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors deborah findley and ciara'n hinds following their play you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters	16
1	this is the best la traviata i was so moved that i had to take a break it really touched me deeply !	16
1	this dvd has a lot of good info and practical tips for improving starts turns and finishes for competitive swimmers i swim for the masters \( adult \) program and am not tremendously competitive but have learned so much i actually swam in a meet and did passably well thanks to some of the ideas i learned from this video well worth it	16
1	i decided to buy a couple strawberry shortcake movies when my 3 year old daughter received a bunch of strawberry shortcakes for her birthday these are very cute movies ! they have a couple of cute songs fun storylines and great messages	16
1	in a movie such as this only james cameron could do it justice this documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel and for that reason everything had to be perfect and it was the special effects are unparalleled and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie this probably could have gotten the remaining 0 5 points \( going by the kab scale of course \) except i was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship which i believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section the kab score 9 5	16
1	i'm not a golfing buff but found the story and golf very good i enjoyed this movie very much	16
1	lagaan is a masterpiece the setting the music the full range of singing the craving for love all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man with failth in himself and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control you the reader must step up to the wicket sooner than you may realize and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind	16
1	once again i truly benefitted from another ellen barrett workout dvd her cueing instruction and professionalism show it she knows how to turn what some consider a tedious plain exercise into a spot on fun enjoyable and worth it workout !	16
1	this dvd is one of the best i have seen only britney spears live tops this in picture quality ricki sings his best songs in front of new york city backdrop he put alot of energy into this concert the sound quality is the best and picture quality is also great a little bit less fuzz on some objects would have been nice ! but still its great and colorfull with all the lights on stage	16
1	i'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	16
1	in response to the earlier reviewer this is sergio garrone 's django il bastardo not the other film the reviewer mentioned django il bastardo is a small gem among spaghetti westerns a low budget b movie in which a ghost \( django \) avenges his own death \( a topic later adapted by clint eastwood for his quot high plains drifter quot \) hence steffen 's quot wooden quot acting is totally appropriate for the role a little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors \( a standout is luciano rossi as the main baddie 's insane brother \)	16
1	i ca n't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd take advantage of the low price and buy this now ! i'm no expert on the hot rod scene but this was very enjoyable the footage of pinstripe artist skratch is worth the price alone i would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this you get to see the creative process of some great project cars as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members i will definitely be watching this one a few times	16
1	the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	16
1	i actually enjoy it more than the matrix check it out i liked it so will you	16
1	richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout \( along with partner emilio estevez \) of pretty madeleine stowe \( they have to watch her house through the night \) and he falls in love with her before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer \( aidan quinn \) it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie but the script is above average especially the dialogue and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target a very entertaining movie definitely worth a watch	16
1	this movie was much better than vanilla sky vanilla sky mostly copied open your eyes but was too obvious and less convincing \( and tom cruise though good in some roles did n't fit this role well \) open your eyes takes a little longer to draw you in but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where vanilla sky does also the jungian dream aspect in vanilla sky is poorly done whereas open your eyes represents the dream experience very well i recommend watching both movies before you buy one but if you 're going to buy get open your eyes	16
1	excellent presentation and goes into detail much of which may be unknown to the viewer one minor criticism the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily	16
1	this dvd is awesome the only problem i have with it is its too short only 4 episodes	16
1	my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie with a young michael j fox in it and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie	16
1	my wife really likes martin after listening to this concert i must say it is indeed a very good live presentation	16
1	he 's a smart guy and it comes through in the material ca n't wait till then next dvd release	16

1	excellent comedy good choice if you need a good laugh rodney dangerfield and bill murray at thier bes	16
1	this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series	16
1	this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie a pleasure to watch the acting characters and story are entirely plausible and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors nor is there any of hollywood 's usual political preachiness \( especially unusual considering robert redford 's backing \) the only downside to the dvd is that it is full screen and not letterboxed the bonus features are somewhat lack luster as well and the menu system is laughable only one actor 's credits have been updated since the movie was released and the credits section is a token gesture at best still this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice	16
1	i loved the artistic topics of art music in this particular little people dvd and i have to say this is one of our favorites but i do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each dvd if you have other lp movies then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there i also agree that the menu setup could be better with all 10 episodes playing back to back rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are otherwise this is still a great dvd much better than the lp storytime collection	16
1	without words been waiting my whole life to get this picture it can take you from laughing ur heart out to burst into tears no comments coz i 'll ruin it but it 's simply a wonderfull movie	16
1	this is a showcase of jet li 's brand of martial arts fast and furious while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going what i did'nt anticipate was the humor absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it 's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying	16
1	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade \( hitler 's killing machine \) sad but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas maybe only the jewish people would truly understand i found it all of these things but with love warmth to the end	16
1	good subject the workings of a devious female mind a complicated love triangle superb acting	16
1	very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery	16

1	i bought this dvd because i was getting sick of the other dvd 's that claim to be pilates workouts this pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial i am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks karen also keeps you motivated to continue not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one beware that you need a resist a ring for one of the workouts though and those can be difficult to find great great workout and i would recommend it to anyone	16
1	i showed this movie to my students they had red the book and this was reenforcement fore the lesson they really enjoyed it	16
1	i became a robson green fan when i saw the first season of wire in the blood since then i have read the books and watched green in his other crime series touching evil if you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes you will enjoy this the crimes are shocking the denouement is interesting and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between dr tony hill \( green \) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes	16

1	this dvd 'd ok it has the original program in it and some new features although i was a bit dissapointed as the new features only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters and the t mac ending goes for like 5 mins and the quality isnt that great	16
1	this dvd is great heck it has the nickel on the cover ! anyways this dvd has a bonus feature of mac 's amazing three point flurry vs san antonio earlier this season in its entirety they used the tnt broadcast a must have just for that alone ! it also has franchise 's game winner during opening night fisher 's 0 4 shot wade 's heroics and of course the classic endings like rik smit 's buzzer beater vs the magic in 1995 larry bird 's game winners and ca n't forget about the best one of them all mj 's final shot in 1998 another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from horry carter iverson and marbury	16

1	this is a terrific tour of hawaii the photography is incredible and it shows hawaii 's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on oahu and maui mt haleakala and waimea canyon the music 's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you 're completely immersed in a hawaiian vacation volcanoes exciting nightlife surfing scuba dives and hulas that were so alluring that the missionaries banned them the only person who would not like this dvd simply does n't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide after you see this you 'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this dvd will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon	16
1	truly his greatest film i have seen thus far not only is one taken in by this movie but it allows one to forget that it 's filmed in black and white the boy elvis of course is even more beautiful in king creole which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture the soundtrack is admirable he delivered it with such effervescence such pride one ca n't help but fall in love with him and this movie too bad elvis was so loyal to col parker he could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be this film certainly promised it	16
1	this movie is nothing special it 's not super awesome but it 's still good i'm the triple shot gun thing is awesome and it 's fairly gory if you 're into dead alive cannibal holocaust the return of the living dead movies and just cheap funny gory zombie movies i recomend this movie	16
1	very good movie great acting plot very touching i am very glad i own this movie i will watch it very often	16
1	quot above suspicion quot offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals the dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man 's \( bakula 's \) past comes back to haunt him consequently tearing his life and his family apart his wife \( sciorra \) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses quot above suspicion quot has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller as well as a heart warmer it 's a must see for almost any movie fan just do n't confuse this quot above suspicion quot with the film starring christopher reve	16
1	while the dubbing may be a little annoying i still love this movie the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book do n't expect the deepest movie in the world but do expect a quality martial arts film	16
1	a night out with the backstreet boys was a romantic dvd each of the five guys gets their own solo turns it also includes songs that are never heard by any bsb fans it 's definitely a great dvd a must buy for every bsb lover ! go grab one for yourself if you have n't yet !	16
1	i thought the video was well done it was good to feature the clinchinggames of the division and league championship series plus all four gamesof the world sries i think they should have included at least the high lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series againstboston and games 1 2 3 and 4 of the league championship series againstlos angeles still i highly recommend this collection for all gung howhite sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights	16
