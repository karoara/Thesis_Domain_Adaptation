0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	0
0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0
0	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
1	fit well great for all kinds of athletic workouts i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	0
1	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet	0

1	i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much	0
1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned excellent quality and fit	0
1	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company	0
1	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai	0
0	i am a 38 ff and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back	0
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems this time was different they sent the wrong shorts i paid the shipping to send them back i asked please send the right shorts they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid and that was that certainly not satisfied	0

0	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night	0
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	0

0	i wish there were 0 star although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them after searching a lot for buying a present for my sister 's birthday i found this sandal and i decided to buy i ordered it on march 9th and after 20 days ! ! still i have n't received them ! ! ! ! ! ! i am getting my money back not only i have wasted my time but also i should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late ! ! ! ! conclusion these sandals are very beautiful but never fall for them	0
0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0

1	as a new 36dd \( ca n't wear underwire \) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market for the past 5 years \( since my surgery \) i 've been searching for the perfect bra i have finally found it !	0
1	i liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic but otherwise they fit perfectly	0
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0
1	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional love them strong and tough not to heavy has good grip on snow	0
1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0

1	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim \( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we 've had trouble in the past \) several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included these tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen no more headaches in trying to find our luggage	0
1	better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures buttons are fairly intuitive instructions are understandable and there 's nothing like being the first kid on the block with a new toy getting all sorts of comments about my picture show	1
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
1	this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment i do n't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera coupled with an l series zoom lens	1

1	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf 10 when this case was on back order it was terrrible so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased the camera fits perfectly into the case and although it is described as a soft case it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk	1
1	bought these binoculars for my husband he loves them they are very powerful and he loves the way they feel not too heavy he can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees	1
1	excellent clarity even on cloudy days i have had others that cost 4 times the price and would not match the quality of these comes complete with with case caps and neck strap	1
1	i purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera this is my second point and shoot digital camera since i have abandoned film it is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures it has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me i have used it on an entire week long vacation without re charging it kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less	1
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great unlike the century wide angle lens this is fully zoom through lens is 8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm also very little barrel distortion in all a great lens only drawback is that it 's a big \( heavy \) lens but then hey it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder	1
0	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera the picture quality was not good at all i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera it stopped working and i did not use it that much i now own the sony cybershot dsc w50 that takes great pictures i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006	1
0	i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case	1
1	this monopod does a great job for my camera you have the quick easy off it attatches to your camera by a screw and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly i wanted a nice inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense i have a canon 35mm and i recently purchased a 75 300 zoom lense for it and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot if i knew then what i know now i would buy it again nice product	1
1	it 's easy to use and makes good pictures easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e mail	1
1	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
0	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	1
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used the delay between pictures is incredibly long the lens shutter does n't open properly \( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems	1

0	should have listened to the reviewer before me unit arrived dead neither ac power or car charger worked tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work	1
0	poor focus blurry awful optics do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features	1
0	very disappointed in this product and amazon 's response to the problem item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed they have told me they ca n't supply the missing part \( the metal neck strap showing in the photo \) as item comes from a freight forwarder i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country	1
0	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger i think it 's odd as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery i do n't know whether the dock works okay because i did n't get that far this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one now i have to buy another battery	1

1	i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex s500 that was sadly stolen from me it 's the same size which i love and as convenient which is awesome it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken it 's one of my favorite things ever	1
0	it worked fine the first week then the focus stopped working i sent it to repair it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working i sent it for repair for the second time it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working also it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony ! ! ! they make you wait over an hour ! ! ! si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for ! ! ! sony repair reference number e3317596	1

1	with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic and i have great faith that they will keep it there reliable and more professional than a brick	1
0	i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work this is terrible terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
0	the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera	1
0	great camera for the price but i guess you get what you pay for bad warranty	1
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier professional medical photographer	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	this digital camera is awesome i have no problem with the batteries i made sure i put the good batteries in \( no cheap ones \) i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march awesome digital camera you wo n't be sorry on this purchase	1
0	i ordered the original item used it for about a week then sent it to my son in new hampshire he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up never to function properly again i ordered a replacement checked it out and sent it on to him with the same result less than 15 minutes of use it quit working i thought the unit was nice compact and fairly easy to use but with two malfunctions in two cameras i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone	1
1	this is a great bag it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well i'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else	1
1	started to by a less expensive bag last january \( dec now \) and i'm shure glad i did n't for the money this bag is a good one it 's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly the tripod holder on top has been real convenient	1
0	i selected a sony vf 30cpkxs polarizing filter but it took me to this page where i got a sony vf r30nkx 30mm neutral density filter there is a big difference may 9 2006 i hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception	1
0	i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc they let me down as well when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit this will come back and bite them in the behind	1
0	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
1	this is the perfect camera for me i take alot of close up detail shots and the images come out great it is smaller than my old g3 \( which i loved but was pretty chunky \)	1
0	this product did n't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit the sound from the ecm hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself i wish i had not bought it	1
1	if you have the big lenses \( 400mm f 2 8l is usm or even the 70 200mm f 2 8l is usm \) this is totally worth the addition the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f 2 8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges check compatability on canon 's website you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	ok i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good	1
1	nice portable background support kit stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution easy and quick to put up i put it up by myself with very little effort all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting	1
0	this is a good charger quick and portable but the battery life of the battery sucks !	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	i have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250 00 by this date this lens cost is usd 95 00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20 00 that means you will pay usd 365 00 for a 8x zoom camera for that price or less you can get a 10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200	1
0	not worth the 10 i paid especially when i had to spend 7 to ship it ! !	1
1	this lens is amazing nothing escapes it it 's like a black hole clearly the best lens i have ever owned it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera it comes with a beautiful case a hood and a tripod mount on the lens believe me you will need it i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great i will now get to work reading the small manual it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings wow !	1
1	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
1	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it super easy to use good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket	1
0	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
1	the changer performs perfectly i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original about one foot shorter other than that it is fine i gave my original changer to my daughter whose charger died just before leaving the country	1
1	after using both lenses i think this is much better here are my reasons 1 f 2 8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate 2 bokeh is much better in this one 3 macro is slightly better on this one 4 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size 5 is is not very crucial in 24 50 range	1
1	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	1
1	the np bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature	1
1	sony has done it again ! fast charging and long lasting this battery is perfect for my sony cyber shot camera !	1
1	though the lenses for my nikon d50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass this size 52mm was what was specified for my d50 and it fits perfectly as it should i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller if you are new to digital slr 's like i was then get this filter to protect your lens and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens	1
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked the older model is far superior this camera is slow to focus slow to shoot and slow to save i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition \( indoor medium light \) on the automatic setting all 5 pictures turned out different only one turned out clear i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with	1
1	got this camera because a friend had a similar one the blue tooth feature is just great you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size all in all a great buy	1
0	there 's little more to say great item almost a must have but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal	1
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
0	this is not at all suitable for young children it 's awkward and difficult to use we 're sending it back totally inappropriate for children	1
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
0	well at least some stuff is cool free cam bag the pics come out excellent the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to freeze up bottom line i recommend at least researching other brands of mini tapeless cams but this one isnt worth 159 or whatever its trash go for something else	1
1	me encuentro muy conforme con el producto es de excelente calidad y muy buen precio amazon es para mi el mejor sitio para la compra de cualquier producto	1
1	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry based on my trial use of the vx2000 that was three years ago this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production plus i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves	1
0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect forthe dx759	1
0	loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it two years later my feelings are very different batteries need to be recharged constantly camera rarely turns on after being off it 's dock for more than an hour all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying zoom is worthless pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated flash is also way too bright half of my pictures are annoyingly white looking because of this definitely going with canon on my next purchase	1
1	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
1	i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon so far the lens has performed as expected it is solid and well built sticks slightly when zooming through 200mm images are crisp and focus is sharp working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick overall good lens for 200 if you have more money then a lens with image stabilization \( is \) would be the way to go	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
1	yep it extends the eyepiece out a little bit which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display but it also distorts the view in an annoying way i use mine on occasion but not all the time	1
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	1
0	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
0	the camera \( canon s 80 \) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card much less a second battery pack or the charger i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories total waste of	1
1	this is my first camcorder so i do n't have much to compare it to but i 've enjoyed it so far it 's easy to use the picture quality seems high the only minor problem i 've found is with the headphone input had to try three different sets of headphones before i could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is	1
1	i do weddings portrait and outdoor photography and i do n't see any reason why i 'd ever switch from the d70 \( other than the d80 \) this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point do n't be scared by the 6 1 mp i print at 20x30 all the time w out any problems i 'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
0	cons only no pros the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash	1
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	1
1	purchased as a gift and well received seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner runs everyday all day and no problems encountered displays vacation pictures clearly like that it is big enough to view across the room frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 model previously purchased	1
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel 71 of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 \( as of today \) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with 5 megapixels i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
0	hello all lens hoods are pretty much a necessity but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used unlike other hoods that screw on this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one and release the clips this leads to problems of alignment meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right although it 's a pain and i hate i do n't really have another alternative either go w o a hood or take this one either way guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one	1
1	i have received this camera for serveral weeks it 's a good long zoom digital camera i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized the picture is sharp image quality is good however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 when the iso is 400 or above i can see the noise and the picture lose detail but every camera has its own defect overall i am satified with this camera and i am enjoying using it to take pictures	1
1	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1
0	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son i was surprised at how well cheap it appeared we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first then it worked for about 10 minutes then it never worked again and we had to return it amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly we ended up buying the dgx 5 1 mp from a local store i it 's place it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth not a professional photography instrument but a pretty decent unit for him	1
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected and was just what i wanted very small but versitle large screen very satified with my purchase	1
1	i'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is much better than another but for my canon ef s 10 22mm on a 20d i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded canon it fits fine does n't interfere with the lens hood looks clear seems to attenuate that nasty ultra violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all protects the front element what more would one want	1
0	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver \( the smallest one you can find \) to achieve it unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to	1
0	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont then after a week it just stops working dont get it theres no flash whatsoeve	1
0	we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new and one day the lens just wo n't open it lights up then after a few seconds it turns off automatically called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair the price they 've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon ! i 'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point so i'm expecting a believable quote for repairs i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera	1
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly	1
0	the bag is suppose to hold two cameras i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl	1
0	fuji fails to honor warrantee do n't buy from themdo not buy the fuji digital camera they charged me for a fix within the warrantee period their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee	1
1	have had good luck with these batteries they last for a long time first time with amazon and it was a good experience will use them again	1
1	i have been using kodak cameras for years this is my third kodak digital camera it does everything including taking excellent close up wildlifephotos it is as easy to use as a point and shoot however it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera it is well worth the money look no further this is the camera for you	1
1	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1 40 my d50 flies on it	1
0	a great idea poorly executed the construction is cheap the screen is marginal at best but worst of all it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras i have on hand or a usb card reader a piece of junk that i am now returnin	1
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes we purchased it for a cruise because we wanted to carry on the camcorder and have it protected but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	1
0	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player when i first received the kit i charged all of the batteries upon first use i only got 7min out of each battery when i got 20 hrs from the batter sent with the player i learned online that the batteries still have their charge but due to the battery 's memory effect or voltage depression my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much juice is left in a battery do not buy this kit	1
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it not kidding ! when i first got it i called kodak and they told my son \( who is knowledgeable in this stuff \) how to reset the printer we reset it and it worked for awhile then it would n't work any more and i did away with it no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	1
1	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 it 's perfect and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast i received it within a few days	1
1	it is extremely easy to use hard to figure out the menu but once that is done there is no problem takes beautiful pictures great for action shots as well seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in	1
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1
0	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
1	love this battery long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
0	yes it does provide a bit more eye relief and can make it easier to see the whole frame \( by making it smaller \) but there is a major problem with this the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses	1
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	1
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	1
0	it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w b	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are 2 9 x4 2 x1 8 \( wxhxd \) it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit	1
1	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas	1
0	ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality its fuzzy im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back i hope this has helpe	1
1	do n't believe the marketing kodak does i was using only kodakfilms for nearly 5 years i recently switched to fuji based on some online reviews i was pleasantly surprised at the results i highly recommend this film	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1
1	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	1
1	yes this is a very good first camcorder i am a first time user of any cam corder i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting but the software is harder to use that movie maker but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic enjoy do	1
1	i like this small thing work great and cheap	1
1	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed it is easy to use in fact i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand made craftsmanship of the watches its f2 5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you	1
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself the pictures are clear and crisp if i had to buy another i would purchase the same	1
0	the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	1
0	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels i would not recommend this item at all	1
0	decent camera but not great shark mode is nice housing looks good but mine leaked at 20 ft camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present next time i will buy a housing for a better camera canon has some nice ones	1
0	be warned if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing sharing whatever ca n't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks but could n't find one i searched all over asked in several places on the apple web boards talked to the 'geniuses' at the apple store this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive talk about crazy !	1
0	bought the camera charger and the kit as part of the deal every thing looks good except the missing npf 50 battery requested for a replacement in the replacement kit also battery was missing returned both the items 59 99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	love my new jvc everio the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files \( mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio \) i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2 0 which supports this new file type natively it has made editing a breeze	1
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product great quality nevertheless	1
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why 's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one you ca n't go wrong with this camera highly recommended	1
1	it 's a pretty convinient bag i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28 75 lens a canon 70 300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet keys etc the only drawback of this bag is you can not put in big lenses the canon 70 300 is the limit but if you only have a limited gear collection you need to give it a try	1
0	like another reviewer 's my experience has been mixed i use this remote with the d50 sometimes the remote works then it goes on strike then suddenly it works again same distance and angle from the camera i changed the battery same result i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable	1
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless should have sent it back	1
1	i bought two one for me one for my daughter it is compact user friendly it has nice sized screen it comes with a charger \( i 've been told that some do n't \) 6 2 mgp video with audio all this for a very nice price	1
0	i have had several people take my pictures at first everything is fine the pictures are ok the next day my face looks like a pile of baby vomit it is soooo blury then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury i tried fixing it online \( like on the program for the camera \) and it would not work i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks it lasts maybe 3 1 2 hours this camera should be 99 00 trust me people if i could rate this thing at a zero i would it is not worth it however a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5 an awesome little camera	1
1	i was really happy with the telescope it was a good buy too i bought one for a friend als	1
1	excellent choice to make a great job	1
1	received camera exactly as described easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again thank	1
1	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful esp with macro shots highly recommend	1
1	i have n't used it much but the few photos i have taken are excellent i'm not a photography expert so i 'll leave the technicalities to others telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount the high quality of this lens as with the wide angle is obvious comes with caps and a storage bag	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find just the right spot i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise i live in a single story 2100 sq foot house i should have returned it right away but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time now 10 months later the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor i love having the video monitor though so i will look for a different brand	1
1	it was everything it was reported to be it works very well we take it on every trip we take	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
0	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box it takes the output of the camcorder \( composite rca or s video \) and compresses that to mpeg 2 \( dvd \) or mpeg 4 \( or divx \) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd \( mpeg 1 or mini dvd \) look for plextor 's m402u box unless you really want to deal with 3 125 mb of data per second \( 25 mbps \) or about 180 mb per minute or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link get the m402u your options will be greatly expanded and you wo n't tell the difference by looking	1
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	1

0	the roll of paper that i recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper i am trying to get it replaced but adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old i was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues	1
1	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it this was the exact replica and it works great	1
0	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does i thought it was a pretty good deal for 26 i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	1
1	i purchased this for my canons500 i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new good quality construction and a great look feel	1
0	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time at first it worked great then after 2 3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 we returned it to get another and it did the same thing we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal i do not recommend this to anyone	1
1	for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times this flash solves the problem i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience items were sent quickly	1
0	just returned the mobicam had poor reception even in adjacent room ! smallo screen not stable falls easy seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house !	1
0	horrible camera barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz drained the batteries within a few pictures so not worth more then the cost of a disposable ! ! sorry kodak but i 'll stick with the good ol' reliable sony	1
1	kodak v705 black small can carry in pocket wide angle lens great for group photos fast start up time video mode is easy built in mic picks up all the sounds camera can stitch 3 photos together great for vistas i am happy with this camera bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it kodak makes easy to take photos weak flash try not to be more than 6 8 feet away or use photoshop on photos	1
0	i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more then nothing for the rest of the roll we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it should have bought a disposable one	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	i bought this camera for my sister as an early christmas present thinking i would need some time to set it up for her well in less then 30 minutes i was ready it 's a awesome camera i was impressed of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone great photos from very close to far away i would recommend this camera to anyone	1
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards i bought it for future use as i do n't currently have the lens yet but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too	1
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs this hood how can you pay 75 for a great prime lens and 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging how to i recharge it \? nothing tells me how to recharge it so far money wasted unresponsive to my emails	1
0	i agree with m arse with the 2star rating i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers i 've read that it has much better shutter speed recommended \? \?	1
0	very dissappointed my son \( i bought this for them \) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used audio just static and noise i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work try telling this to me before i purchase thank you this is the last i purchase equipment on line i will stick to books thank you very much	1
1	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me 1 \) the battery is the canon genuine nb 1lh battery \? 2 \) the camera case is canon psc 50 case \? thank you in advance	1
0	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
0	this is a terrible product 1 the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use 2 the pictures are extremely poor 3 the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient w	1
1	i love this camera i have now traveled all over the usa some places in europe and will be using it in china lens is excellent i wish it were lighter weight but ca n't have everything and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else	1
1	this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus	1
0	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i'm going to europe \( two days after it died \) now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off grrrrr ! !	1
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
0	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1
0	i took it straight out of the package plugged it in for a charge charger never reached green ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later customer service was not the best i 've had do n't make the same mistake keep looking	1
1	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera i love this camera i think it takes awesome pictures	1
1	my bother in law and i went to africa on safari last year we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well	1
1	very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival	1
0	this is a 1 2 volt battery charger useless for anything that requires aaa 1 5 volt batteries	1
0	ok maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera both my 30d and rebel xt if i am lucky enough it will fall off get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory	1
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built they were not interested in even trying to help i hate it when companies only care about their profits	1
0	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
0	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else it does not include a docking station you have to shell out more money for that option i dont think so	1
1	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
0	i loved this camera when i got it but after three months the lens would not close it makes grinding noises the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again i am very disappointed in this camera	1
1	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased at this time i have not gone under water with it	1
1	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony it works great had no problems so far it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv	1
0	poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out	1
1	i am starting my career as a professional photographer and i have n't had any problems with these filters they come in a nice case and are easy to attach to my lenses	1
1	goo	1
1	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
1	this is a nice bag but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag i ca n't even get the thing in the bag it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories good quality	1
0	i just got this printer dock with a camera and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried when it does feed it ends up jamming i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	1
0	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
0	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
1	third camera from kodak easyshare great performance and pics slendor size	1
0	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
0	the case fits like a tight glove i do n't like that the camera was hard to get in and out and did n't have any pockets for straps or batteries	1
0	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future the lens adapter by itself does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else \? \? \? ben boykin las cruces nm 8801	1
1	i have the white one \( black was unavailable at the time of purchase \) 1 the camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet it is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle 2 durable no scrapes or scratches in 7 months 3 have n't missed the belt clip option its small enough to fit in my pocket4 well constructed durable people think its some sort of ipod case holder	1
1	having just gone back to using a film camera from digital \( my wife still uses digital \) i have found this to be an excellant camera so far i have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect i would recommend it	1
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them	1
1	my sony dscw100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby	1
1	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price	1
0	in an email adorama specified that the filter diameter was 28mm on the amazon com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 of the purchase price an amount i feel is beyond absurd i can buy this locally for a lot less \( even though i would have to pay sales tax \) buyer beware	1
1	fast delivery great price i would buy from them again thanks	1
0	rated one star for the lack of value you can buy the same canon brand case for under 14 and a higher capacity imho better albeit non name brand 1200mah battery for under 10 from amazon the neck strap is not worth the difference	1
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense it sucks i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality if you get closer than five inches the pictures messes up i 've had no other problem with the hardware though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed oh and night photos also suck big time even with the flash on	1
1	from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colorscons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrastyfor myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the 1 6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great except for the touch screen feature that takes a little getting used to especially when accessing the special features \( such as fader effects \) while filming the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer all in all it is a good product just takes some getting used to	1
1	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible \( has a divider you can place where ever you want \) so you can secure cameras however you wish	1
0	yes i have to agree with the previous review it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much and just chalk it up to extra protection but that seems to be all it 's good for	1
1	great camera only bad thing are the batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures and has some good features	1
1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	1
1	i got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures its also very sleek and small	1
1	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy it has both point and shoot and slr features you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography the software was easy to use easy to set up and it works well on my mac it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name	1
1	the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility the stabilization aspect is a great help although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt	1
1	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with	1
1	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
0	very good product very satisfied the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette	1
1	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
1	we use our batteries a lot no problems works as advertised	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
1	for its size and price this little light ca n't be beat very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors i think this is a must have for camcorder owners my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long term return	1
1	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1
0	i bought two one time but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them and the jvc even would not cover the charge	1
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price \( if you get a good deal \) photo quality is poor and screen is quite small \( 3x5 \) navigation is not overly complicated but buttons must be pushed hard to work it did work perfectly fine took sd card even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame but because of the poor quality of the photos i do n't suggest buying	1
0	if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos it does work well for video the sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself is a disappointment	1
0	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
0	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1
0	i 've never ordered anything and been this disappointed i ordered two of these and both did n't work i contacted the company 's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support i will never buy another product from this company again	1
1	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1
1	the flash works very well i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash it works great i am very happy with this product	1
1	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration	1
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder \( sony hdr hc1 \) it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod	1
1	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased the pictures are wonderful the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem free we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do the slideshow feature is wonderful as well everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed to be sure they are expensive but worth the cost we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right	1
0	i was down in antarctica when i turned on the camera and it said lens error after a day of missing some of the best pictures of emperor penguins with my 8800 i twisted the lens and got it to work the same thing happened to me in bolivia just after the warranty expired i called nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera do a google search of lens error and nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience this is my third and last nikon	1
1	i'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power it 's compact not heavy has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right in addition to the light output the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced an excellent feature getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally brochure reading averse twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment but had given up both i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt there is no clip on the case itself holds only the camera not even space for a spare battery or memory card \( i 've heard the case will darken your camera but i did n't end up using the case \) the neck strap is not useful it 's too long at '34 inches if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it \( the canon camera rocks however	1
1	this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a 4 star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it 's a good product	1
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	1
0	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great but then i realized it would only display 142 images i worked with technical support for several months \( they are not the speediest or most helpful \) i resized renamed restructured the photos tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course only to recieve another with the same problem i would n't recommend this purchase	1
1	your site was the only place where could find a replacement for my lost nikon uc e6usb cable for my nikon coolpix 3100 even nikon could not satisfy my request thank youcynthia valesi	1
1	i am not much of a photographer i found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great believe me it 's the camera the stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time i can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily i'm thrilled you do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb memory card when you buy the camera	1
0	it looks cool and it 's easy to carry but that is about it camera is slow and pictures are often blurry sorry i wasted my money on this one get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue	1
1	of course it had to be kodak no matter what people say i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera i 've found this camera to be a real warrior last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better photo cuality its very good and colors are great no excesive blue or red in your pics night photo taking its excelent in close shots 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater but its nothing a 25 batterie charger can`t solve sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje	1
1	after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month it has met my expectations and perhaps then some after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150 ish range i partially regret spending what i did it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth bottom line no complaints with it	1
0	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
0	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with so i decided to get this new one i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera but compared to a similar sony model the canon was noticeably louder while operating way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	1
1	i really enjoy this camera mine has the carl zeiss vario tessar lens it works grewat be sure to use the memory stick pro media a great reasonable priced camera	1
1	excellent product for the price pictures are not that good but you ca n't ask more for this price	1
1	very clear bright day strong magnification quality seems to be good very well priced at around 100 00 i will know more over the passage of time my firstimpression is good mj schra	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	it got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it \( a month or so later \) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly a huge disappointment and waste of my money	1
1	it is a great camera very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances grainy pic in dim light go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car	1
0	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets quite small for the price just paying for the name on the bag	1
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
0	if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool it 's ok but if you are the open water diver please do n't buy it i try it yesterday it will not work after 10m 33ft it will show the red screen and count down timer it scare me and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday 's dive it 's really disappointed to me	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
1	this camera works well except that the shutter speed is a bit slow the image quality is decent the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient the camera is pretty sturdy i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine	1
0	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
0	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
0	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months i 've called digital spectrum sent faxes and emailed them this has been going on for nearly a month a real waste of money my time	1
0	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips are they abandoning this product \? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself	1
1	i really enjoy this small high quality camara i purchased a 2 0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage of the 7 1 mega pixel and i get great pix everytime i have lots of fun with it since its so small it 's easy to take everywhere with me i also get lots of compliments on it 's fashionable sleek design i highly recomend his camera	1
0	the battery does not hold up after 10 months it would not work at all i thought it was the battery emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable i found one and changed it out myself the unit was just dead warranty is 60 days will not buy another one	1
1	the cover over the lense broke small lcd screen pictures are pritty good battery life is pritty good some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady takes nice portaits easy to use has a veiw finder	1
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size it was n't even close no size was given for the lense diameter i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it	1
0	i paid 99 00 for this little camcorder thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc the menu button would not bring anything up so overall we just could n't get this thing to work a bummer of a christmas present	1
0	i loved this camera but i have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous system error 2 design fault which plagues many of these the repair service is slow the camera has been in repair 50 of the year i have had it	1
1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery plus if an electrical outlet is convienent like when shooting inside you never have to worry about running out of power also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc ac converter but not as overall convienent as an extra battery i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery but it does n't nikon should add this feature in	1
1	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it the quality of the pictures is very poor showing large grain even at shq and low iso settings no combination of settings seems to improve quality	1
1	this tripod arrived on time and in good condition however i have to put the heavy duty in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well the weight you can put on it is limited however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer	1
1	i am pleased with the purchase very good value picture quality is good and it is easy to operate only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic however it looks good this is my second purchase of this product one for myself and one as a gift	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	the leather is very soft and the case is simply quality i should have bought this one the first time	1
0	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
0	we have had this camera for about a year we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone	1
1	very happy with the lens and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
1	i 've seen this item for no less than 7 00 elsewhere so i got a good deal	1
1	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
0	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera the battery is dead i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day i should expect very much i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes but i should n't have to do so	1
1	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field it does not appear on the lcd you can only see it through the viewfinder this is different from previous models minor annoyance the quality of the videos was surprisingly good but it saves them in the quicktime mov format mov is not my favorite format but perhaps others will not be bothered by this although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural i have found it to be excellent the overall quality of the pictures is good for the price i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers	1
0	i am not satisfied by this product the calrity is not good also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen	1
1	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these and the charger is okay just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most	1
1	is an product of great quality is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1
1	this is one fantastic flash i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
0	thought i 'd died and gone to heaven this lens was everything i wanted and more three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus now it does a focus dance clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus it 's not my d70 which still works wth other lenses this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it i 'll revise this review	1
0	the s9000 fits perfectly in the case too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop apparently the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also too bad the camera strap is extremely short made for very small people so instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well i will adapt the case to work for me i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on it will work but only after extensive modification great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	1
1	i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field this tripod works well for that use it is sturdy has lots of features and is reasonably priced however if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars a right angle adapter will be needed i found one on ebay for a few dollars	1
0	i have an r717 camera i bought the dock too each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera i bought a clone battery \( not hp \) and its edges are rounded too maybe hp could explain the difference just thought you would like to know	1
0	date on still photo will not print it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	1
1	i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz 7 the lz 7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode pros takes great pictures optical image stabilization 6x zoom and great price it is also made in japan not china as the nikon l5 is cons fixed zoom while in movie mode no on board camera speakers	1
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos we promptly sent it back for a refund i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !	1
0	here 's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired the camera is only about 2 years old guess i 'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits ! the camera really performed nicely when it was working thus the 2 stars hope you have better luck than me if you get one	1
1	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily	1
1	300 plus minutes of recording time \( without lcd \) i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery on the hdr fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time	1
1	this is a great lens for any user professional or amateur this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive clean results a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm \( 16mm cropped \) but this is easily correctable with software in addition the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door architecture shots \( especially realtors \)	1
1	wow ! ! ! this is my 4th sony i keep trading up and i am so impressed there is no delay on the shutter speed great pictures and enough special effects to be fun but not enough that you need a phd to operate	1
0	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
1	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	1
0	crap does n't work wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period plastic junk never did get a good signal the worst sony item i 've ever purchased and i'm a sony fan will still attempt to return somehow do n't even bother	1
1	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
0	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures	1
1	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little \( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards \) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation make sure to get a memory stick with it though because w o it it only holds about 15 pics this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again	1
1	after 2 years the camera 's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge this replacement battery arrived promptly fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours i wish i had replaced the battery sooner instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power	1
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
1	i love this flash i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual i would definitely recommend this flash	1
0	unless you want to have trouble focusing have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event or have the neck strap bracket break off etc i wear glasses and these never did focus well for me i was not happy when the bracket broke off the day i received them just as i was to leave for an africa safari vacation the biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip and it was frustrating even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired suposedly there is a warranty on these hah ! when i sent them to bushnell for repair they wanted	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	this product is exactly as it is described wonderful tasting and delicious too bad it does n't come in a bigger container	2

1	sure it 's not 100 pure vanilla extract that 's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin personally i love its strong distinctive flavor regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is for those who feel it 's too strong use half the amount listed in the recipe i know a couple of people who do this when using molina vanilla again i like the flavor so i use the full amount called for in the recipe this stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch	2

1	i have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago i was horrified this past thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it i tried to improvise with garlic powder and italian seasoning but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past i ca n't say enough great things about this stuff i use it to season burgers steak to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes it 's not just great it 's amazing ! !	2
1	i did n't realize when i bought them they were so big i just thought they were little bottles they still have the same great taste	2
1	yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free there are technical issues with the pods 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work \( i have black decker home cafe machine \) great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it i also feel that to charage 15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi	2

1	great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike more of an end of the night activity unless you 're just having a dessert party of course ! my one complaint is the impractical \( although oh so whimsical \) tissue packaging it is hazardously absorbent even the assertive flavors of these high quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items note do not store next to your curry sampler best of luck chocoholics a z	2
1	if you appreciate caliente you must try this	2
1	this tea is awesome i had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet after finding it on amazon i looked up all the benefits of green tea and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting so i ordered the jasmine green tea and with a little sugar and lemon i drink it every day excellent product ca n't live without it	2

1	i use almonds in cereal cake and bread both for nutrition and taste for years i 've been grinding my own this is a high quality product that saves time since it 's already ground the price is highly competitive	2
1	much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets ! i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs not worth the cost ! this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies ideally i 'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past ! it also comes in a very nice basket which is great to re use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage	2

0	i was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements i had nothing but high hopes i was totally open minded i thought it seemed too good to be true \( low cal no carb noodles ! \) but hey i'm an optimist guess what \? it is too good to be true ! i read about washing them and drying them i did no problem i added sauce i put them in my mouth the taste was not the problem it was the texture it was seriously like chewing rubber bands no noodle resemblence whatsoever i honestly ca n't understand those who rave about these but hey to each his own	2
0	the photo shows four containers each 9oz the product is actually only one 9oz container very misleading possibly intentionally so also shipping costs 10 for a 9 product \? give me a break ! on top of it all the chocolate is nothing special you can get 16oz containers of ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for 10 which tastes better	2

1	first of all wow instant noodles for sale on amazon \? second excellent decision on selling nongshim 's shin ramen nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen 's trademark spicyness and deliciosity not as filling as the non cup version \( which you have to cook over a stove \) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied for three hours until you get hungry for more shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion	2

1	i received my package via ups in a reasonable amount of time the coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful but not fake tasting however i did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use for some reason a couple of cups came out really weak so i referred to the senseo handbook for a hint now when i put a pod in i make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly that seems to have solved the problem	2
1	i was really impressed that i was able to buy this product on line it was easy to make the purchase and received the goods on time i will definitely order from them again	2

1	i am new to the world of gourmet salts and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago ! the granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel but that is where the similiarities end the salt dissolves instantly on the tongue it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste the jar suggests it be used on grilled fish and salads but i would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also	2
1	my husband and i were introduced to market spice tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in seattle we loved it and upon our return to jamesville ny begain to regularly order it many of our friends now order it too it is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea	2

1	this is a delicious basic thai yellow curry with some vegetables it comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal but i still found that with this meal i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes nuts or eggplant i do n't have any thai places in my area so i add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that thai craving the sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	2

1	i use these onions for just about everything they are pretty mild and really add a nice light flavor to your cooking this is about what i pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order but then again it is online shopping for groceries so i guess it has to be pricey i use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath ! great great stuff and i highly recommend them	2
1	a friend shared her marketspice tea with me years ago and i was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me i ordered some and that wonderful taste was still the same the teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in it 's a flavor you wo n't find anywhere else you can taste the orange and the cinnamon and they 're just a little sweet you may not need to even sweeten yours !	2

1	oh how i love the most delicious incredible edible fruit of the plant cucumis sativus who would 've thought that this was a member of the gourd family cucurbitaceae a cousin of the melon \? cucumbers have many great uses they 're delicious in salads and is there any snack tastier than a pickle \? i also hear they have non culinary uses as well some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes maybe that 's because they 're 90 water i 've also heard that there are more adult uses for the cucumber but i 've only seen that in movies	2

1	these crackers are absolutely delicious whether you need to be eating gluten free or not i ca n't getenough of them my favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored these crackers are thin andcrunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a servingonto the cracker i love them alone i love them with tuna fish i 've used them for dipping salsa andguacamole but when i see them all disappearing quickly i hope i have n't used up my last box beingi am gluten intolerant this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when i'm craving something crunchyand flavorful	2
1	i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts	2
1	i first tried these in south africa now my best friend will ship some to me with packages that she sends on my birthday or other special occasions i love them ! i want to have them here in the states ! ! !	2

1	this was not exactly what i was expecting i thought it would be more like what i call vietnamese sesame balls yet they were pretty good despite my mistake	2
1	i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	2
1	i really enjoy this tea has the best flavor of any of the oolongs i have tried the leaves are whole and you do not get a lot of tea particles in your cup or pot	2
1	we originally purchased this candy in walt disney world at the japan pavilion when we returned home the kids wanted more of it but i could n't find any around town i came to amazon and here it was they were thrilled it has a good flavor and texture and they really enjoyed it	2
1	i recently started a diet where i could only eat the egg white not the yolk because of the fat content i make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source the powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen \( anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what i'm talking about \) not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore i also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs this is a fantastic product and well worth the cost	2
0	i would like to buy one of these products from wine country gift baskets but i cannot find a description of what is actually in each one	2
0	come on this is 2005 twinkies are n't food anymore than cheez whiz is twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while i'm just as guilty of that but eating twinkies is practically self mutilation look at the ingredients list and do some reading yikes ! everyone 's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too sorry hostess that definitely does not include twinkies	2
1	this is very good peanut brittle i found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free in fact i found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle i have eaten most peanut brittle is hard as a rock this brand had a perfect crisp crunch	2
1	the sugar free was very good i 've had the regular but these are really good too especially if you are a diabetic or just want to avoid sugar quite a few flavors	2

1	have n't tried cooking with them yet but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way they are beautiful specimens i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them	2
1	these egg whites work great and are economical i recently started a diet where i can only eat egg whites it seems such a waste to throw out the yolks not to mention the mess of separating the eggs i use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods the powdered egg whites do have an eggy odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets	2
1	better than expected quality very nice quality and very attractive quick shipping and response	2
1	i bought this candy and when i tasted it it tasted so good so its the best candy but it hurts your teeth when you eat but this is good and addicting cand	2

1	i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted if you 'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat	2
1	do n't go for generic gooey dollar store imitations this is what gummy bears are supposed to be the next best are black forest	2
1	now i'm all in favor of hershey 's kisses but you look at this guy here and you kind of have to wonder i mean who buys 25 lbs of individually packaged chocolate count chocula on a bender \? perennial halloween door answerers preparing for the apocalypse \? let 's face it this is the ultimate milk chocolate and tinfoil experience i just hope you 're ready for it	2
1	this was a delight to receive ! it was delivered fast and was packaged beautifully ! there is a little something for everyone and everything is fresh and delicious i plan on ordering for friends and office for the holidays	2
0	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2
1	these are really good just like in the uk you 'd think they were caviar from the pricing though	2

1	tuscan milk kosher ! vitamin d and grade a ! good source calcium ! thank you	2
1	when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better it is more slender with richer chocolate it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much very balanced if you love chocolate this is definitly better worth trying	2
1	ume en is one of the best brands of green tea powder i have ever tasted this tea has a light delicate flavor with just a touch of sweetness which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful relaxing and rejuvenating experience with this drink tea time is going to take on a whole new meaning i would definitely recommend this product	2

1	never had biscotti before what a treat since then i 've tried other biscotti and this was the best	2
1	nothing says 'taste of italy' like a gallon of tuscan 's finest the aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course even veal ! it 's even great paired with dessert ! do n't be fooled by cheap imitations folks this is the real thing ! remember if it 's tuscan it 's kosher ! now with extra whiteness	2
1	i found this candy in the 7 eleven in my area two years ago and just loved it i would eat so much my mouth would blister inside but since last year have searched high and low but cant find it anywhere can i order it myself and not go to a store my kids love it as well and have tried other sour candys but none come clos	2
1	obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot ! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope ! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass	2
1	i'm definitely a satisfied customer my dhl package got to me damaged and the box was wet the bubble tea customer service representatives where wonderful about replacing it i will buy from them again ! they have excellent customer service in my book ! thanks ange	2
1	my japanese pen pal y yamamoto just adores strawberry pocky and tells me they 're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations mind you i'm not sure i should believe yohko chan as she describes these situations many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way but i must admit they 're entertaining reading and the souvenier she sent me from that space hot springs was rather interesting although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me still i want to date her friend ruuan she looks hot in an amazingly ditzy sort of way	2
0	this tea is very bitter it is very aromatic it does smell nice and exotic but it was just too much for my simple tastebuds	2
1	this candy is awesome read my review i posted on the 5lb bag page and while you are at it buy the 5 bag they are way cheaper this 12 pack ends up being only 3 75 lbs and costs 12 50 and the 5lb bag is only 13 00 as of this review	2
1	this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only 12 for 12 ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it	2
1	the kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool they appear to be quite fresh have cooked with them it was wonderful thank	2
1	pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills	2
1	of all teas i 've tried this is my favorite sweet powerful and fragrant marketspice is the answer for many moods and cravings i prefer this tea hot steeped for 5 minutes but its good cold as well although i 've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming be warned if you only like very subtle white teas this may not be for you but it has converted many a non tea drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	2
1	marmite is great its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you 'd been walking around in an old factory for a day i think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world thank god they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth	2
1	if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend	2
1	the best of the best for harley enthusiasts well written fair and honest great motorcycle accessory and clothing reviews terrific custom bike features and excellent presentation easy to follow tech and classics without all the girlie nonsense	3
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
1	i have read vanity fair for the past twenty years the articles are timely and in depth there are articles on politicians bankers ceos as well as the hollywood types this is the magazine for those who want to be in the know also the photographs are fantastic if you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress actor of the hour this is not the magazine for you	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	i'm very disappointed with this magazine it seems to be a total waste of money i found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2 3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas but it 's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something i can use	3
0	it is impossible to review this item as item was never received i have found it very difficult to contact anyone to find out where this item is	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market very realistic with budgets too it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable \( on any budget \) i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful	3
0	i ordered in november and i am still waiting to receive this item	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine they had no problem charging my credit card but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year what a bunch of nonesense	3
1	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name however i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light but there is so much more always an article on a travel destination an article on beauty and an article on a sport as well as other constants the theme of the magazine is total healthy living incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive	3
0	i have read bird times many times the articles are much less complicated than the bird talk magazine articles which are fairly simplistic as well i recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read this magazine usually takes me 15 20 minutes to read and that is if there is an interesting article fewer ads than bird talk	3
1	for those of us who miss being in the center of the universe reading the observer is almost like being there in its pink pages i can read stories about new york 's political arts society finance sex and gossip scene i can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in vermont	3
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing boy am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health	3
1	i like the different projects and items you can buy plus they give prices and online addresses overall i'm quite pleased with this magazine	3
1	budget travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland i also like some not all of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written however at the same time it does need better organization as compared with \( horrors \) conde nast i am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible i cant access it ! !	3
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges \( 6 and 9 \) and is a valuable investment for any parent i do n't know what i would do without this magazine it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car not to mention it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months	3
1	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom while she shopped i hung out in the magazine section reading mad cracked and fangoria now 25 years later i finally got my own subscription and unlike retro video games nostalgic 80 's cd 's and members only jackets this is just as good as i remember it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases the low down on independent if not underground extreme horror dvd 's and as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine it is a great read and a lot of fun	3
1	this magazine transports you to a different world every issue is a wish book with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month or crafts to do over your next long weekend or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room well in my life years go by and i dream on but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped negative angry thoughts i will never laugh at crafty people again i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside but the dreams are sweet the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating but then you have gardening cooking baking furniture decorating beading anything do it yourself martha is truly a wonder woman worth every cent	3
1	i never subscribe to anything ! this magazine is great there are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes i'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines are n't that useful to me i might enjoy reading them but i do n't actually use their recipes i 've made 4 of the recipes out of this last everyday food issue and they were very healthy \( lots of veggies chicken brown rice salmon etc \) tasted really good and were also fast which is a bonus for me i 'd give this magazine 10 stars if i could	3
1	ordered this for my son sometimes it takes a while for the order to reach him in prison so i'm not sure he has received it yet since you wrote and reminded me i'm thinking it did get to him as others have been returned	3
1	spike fett is mistaken the 100 greatest moments he mentions is not for all time they were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime which is only 8 years this is one of the best film dvd magazines out there i highly reccomend it it has awesome articles reliable reviews and great color photos another thing i like about it is that its an british publication so you get a different opinion and point of view its a great magazine	3
0	i had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until i bought one from our local super market i was surprised at the difference that i had already paid to order from amazon and what it was there i canceled my order and ordered from them some items are much less on amazon and some are much more you just have to be careful a magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from	3
0	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine beware beware beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way r tully is great about responding to emails it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly if at all i recommend cooking light it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy	3
1	this magazine is by far the best food travel magazine out a bit on the expensive side due to it coming from bbc in england but worth every pound dollar	3
1	as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose	3
0	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas it 's june and she has yet to get a copy i called them in march and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer i 'll going to ask for a refund	3

1	i look forward to recieving my magazine every month i really love this magazine it has articles marriage sex women 's lives etc i do n't know why the others did n't enjoy it	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
1	the smartest best informed and most well entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture i read it cover to cove	3
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
1	this is a fun read the articles are entertaining and short good to pass some time excellent for the plane !	3

1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines	3
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall i had recently watched quot secretary quot and i liked her so i bought it i'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue after buying my first flaunt magazine i wanted to buy more but needless to say the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time \( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there	3
1	i absolutely adore elle decoration as several other reviewers have noted unfortunately the american version ca n't compare the spaces are gorgeous and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious all of my american magazines \( with the exception of interior design \) get ripped apart with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed elle decoration always gets saved in its entirety i highly recommend these magazines are eye candy and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import	3
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	3
0	amazon must think we are fools it 's 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website on the other hand there appear to be a lot of fools here	3
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
1	a good start to create your own business	3
1	great magazine this is not my typical type of read because i 've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi media but the great thing about this magazine is that you do n't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos it tells you about them in simple terms too no high tech vocabulary needed i feel informed whenever i read my monthly subscription of the better products to purchase as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies	3
0	this magazine fell apart so quick they are no longer a unbias magazine instead they are a interscope propaganda machine just look at the covers \? every year shady g unit gets a automatic 8 covers every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag	3

1	i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business	3
1	great magazine covers the full range of net technologies every issue is packed with windows web and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more high recomended	3
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue	3
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature stupid and boring the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste do n't bother	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3

1	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3

0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living i was actually appalled by this magazine it is ostensibly health conscious but upon closer examination it ignores important health information for example in one issue it had a whole article about diabetes and how thanks to the miracles of science diabetics can now eat sugary foods it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet i was disappointed with the magazine	3
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3

1	i 've been a subscriber of e magazine \( which stands for the environmental magazine \) for over a year now and i love it it is by far the best environmentally oriented magazine i 've come across all of the ads are for environmentally friendly companies and products i now purchase products at at least 50 of the places advertised in this magazine e magazine covers topics all over the world including global warming horse meat \( popular in europe \) whaling deforestation etc if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine the issues are bi monthly but are absolutely action packed and fact filled subscribe today	3
0	i cook almost everything from scratch so i figured home cooking would be for people like me who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines instead recipes consist of packaged dough in a can bottled sauces etc i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !	3
0	as is typical of many magazines sunset jams it to existing subscribers they offered me a deal to re subscribe for 12 months for 29 95 ! here on amazon i can get two years \( 24 months \) for 29 95 magazines need to understand basic marketing it takes a lot of advertising dollars \( mailings \) to get a new subscriber once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business	3
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3

1	as a reader i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month i usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word of mouth advice but that 's never been enough for me reading a book is an investment to me and i want to make sure my time is well spent bookmarks gives me the confidence that i'm choosing the books i truly want to read i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes \( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer yukio mishima which also shows that bookmarks looks globally not only regionally for classic authors \)	3
0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships i found that customer service was very dissapointing i missed an issue back in october and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed it is now march and i still have n't received my replacement just a heads up !	3

0	this magazine makes girls who feel geeky and nerdy bad and girls who are normal teens who have crushes and like to stay in style terrible ! plus this magazine is sexist ! it does n't have models anywhere because it says that it makes girls feel bad ! if you want a magazine that is good and inspires read american girls or girls life !	3

1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	3
0	where macworld is bad addict is dreadful it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat and the reviews do n't deserve the name the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing leaving no pretence of independence like its competitor it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry so we get articles about the secrets of such and such product a secret in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer this should be blasted not applauded but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product	3
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day and he really likes it recommend it	3

0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews unlike the description included on the amazon website the subsription does not include the cd rom which costs an additional 1 issue and if you want to purchase the cd roms for past issues they cost 4 disk sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain buyer beware	3

0	this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo do n't waste your money	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
1	this is the magazine for windows it pros i have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at windows nt magazine over time it has gotten thinner but the articles are as informative as ever	3
1	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club \( where he works out \) if you overlook that aspect the mag is great the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate well worth it it also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store	3

0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke it is not that special it is chucked full of ads the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information i find this magazine a waste of our money it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription my mom has already stated that	3

0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago today it is a totally unneeded magazine its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article is actually quite goofy the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm	3
0	love to review history today but have n't seen a copy yet any ideas	3
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription i only received about 3 issues total months went by without anything being delivered while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful nothing happens immediately when planning a wedding each and every month is precious especially during the initial stages of wedding planning to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting plus by this time most of the wedding details were finalized the magazines i received became useless if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride	3
0	i admit they have some good recipes but most of them are not simple and very time consuming there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe if you are a stay at home housewife and absolutely love to cook buy this but if you are just normal you wo n't find many recipes in here for you i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home' before you buy this one	3
1	had great expectations for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there \( and available on the web \) the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine elektor electronics and hardware hack websites would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription am still hoping	3
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
1	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug these are just the best children 's publications we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends	3
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3

0	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	there is never a dull moment with this magazine ! you never know what the next story is going to be just that it will be a great read ! really good photography and illustrations too ! so if you are interested in what makes this world tick check out smithsonian magazine	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that do n't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it very important when it comes to encouraging creativity	3
1	if you live in the country and have a hobby type farm this magazine is bulging with valuable information i was surprised to find no color pages at first but the magazine is recycleable paper printed with soy ink very cool out of all the country type magazines i 've read this one is the best	3
1	i only got the first issue but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers \( hence the name \) i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction they might do well to keep the two separate especially the contests and events it 's an attractive format and very upscale high quality literature reviews and advice the stories are well written and enjoyable although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers	3

0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3

1	bell'italia is an italian language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described the photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving moreover in the more famous cities like venice and florence the places presented are often those that do not get much notice in addition the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting i have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue	3

0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3

1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit it is only as good as the tools you use this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material	3
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full page ads for galleries in europe there are very few articles or artist bios the photos are beautiful but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries	3
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue however as other reviews have indicated the articles are quite lacking they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting so you get vogue for the pictures if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine if you want something to read get something else	3

0	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3

1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3

0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	3
1	i have subscribed for years to this in my opinion the hand 's down best most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available practical solidly researched non preachy and impeccably edited it provides even handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog 's happiness well being and ability to be a good companion the annual dog food ratings alone are worth the subscription price every constituency should be as well served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one	3
1	rue morgue is a true horror magazine you get countless articles on upcoming recent and past horror with interviews from writers directors stars and more there 's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors crave more horror on the 'net then rue morgue is always giving you your fill on websites and what i 've always found to be an awesome thing about rue morgue there 's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini posters and they 're glossy paged rue morgue you just slashed into my heart and did it right	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles profanity porn and blurry black and white photos it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost	3
1	someone posted below that they do n't receive all their issues i have never failed to receive an issue i suspect someone is making off with this person 's copies this is an elegant magazine worthy of martha if they cover a topic you will know all there is to know about that topic the recipes are little gems and i like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved it 's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world i do miss martha 's column of reminiscences and wish that was back in the magazine	3
1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive the articles are interesting and well written the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders if you 're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must have magazine	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
1	i love this magazine and am on my third year the recipes are interesting healthy and easy to make after a day at work they do n't use fake ingredients which was my complaint with cooking light i 'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance and the recipes do n't take all day and 24 7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in gourmet the nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps real food for real life	3
1	came right away and in a timely fashion every two weeks ! great product for a wonderful price ! loved it	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3

1	i go to a gym where people share their magazines and came across this gem while it focuses on value vacation packages the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world the magazine also offers an up to date web page describing even more places and bargains it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots that alone is worth the reasonable cost	3
1	i am not the only to think jose da silveira is not straight now that his carrer is back on track the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging i believe this is the reason this yvette linton smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay just your little detective susi	3

1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nasttraveler and i'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire this magazine has articles about places not about \( as one other reviewer wrote \) articles about martinis fashion etc it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one	3

1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified thanks so much	3
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords she stopped receiving it in june well before her 12 month subscription expired	3
1	this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that pictureimportant they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed \( if it is a person \) this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy	3
1	time is a fascinating magazine to read it provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time the magazine provides more balanced reporting than say newsweek i find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics the arts business and lifestyle and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening so for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide then time magazine should do to those already subscribing for the magazine congratulations for making a good choice	3
1	maxim is a good magazines for adult males i enjoy all articles and their website too it is more affordable subscrition	3
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
1	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4
1	although i did not purchase this product from amazon com \( \) i absolutely love it the gps locator provided is amazing and better than i thought it was it is not one of those gps that updates your position every 20 seconds or something but when i zoomed in i could see my current location constantly moving on the map \( so it is updating every second \) i have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the gps provided to them is n't even this good i recommend this software and gps to anyone	4
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
0	i guess i'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children this game has an enormous amount of story it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television interaction is confusing and frustrating i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation which is top notch i just would n't classify this as a learning game	4
1	i think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning however it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program in order to get the most out of the program i feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level lesson	4
1	do n't expect to receive this by christmas even though it says in stock i ordered this on dec 14th and just received word today the 20th that it is not expected to ship until the end of january early february so if you need it for a specific occasion do n't count on it getting there in time	4
0	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too the colors were spot on after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse my monitor appears dim the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time my hope was that it would make my monitor look better not worse i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	4
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour this includes capital gains losses dividends and amt calculations it does n't get much easier than this yes you have to download updates the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it but would n't that take at least as long	4
0	i agree with reviewer mr dietz i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for 24 99 put it in and loaded it in this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all no help menu either we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her there is nothing here to learn chess from	4

1	this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike it no longer supports windows 98 which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years the street maps it produces are accurate except for a few minor glitches	4
1	you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very messy system but it does have a great antivirus and firewall and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes it 's an okay product but be very careful with the cleanup tool it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	4
1	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	4
1	works work what cam i say i have been using microsoft products for years quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant	4
0	i found this software very difficult to use it does not have any stop or go back button the only way to exit an activity is to hit esc button to exit the program and then start all over when starting over there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and i could not find a way to skip it	4
0	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return and it calculated that i owed the state 550 for underpayment as well as a 230 penalty for late payment i tried working through the program several times to find the error i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem which i was not able to resolve in frustration i went to and filed my return easily within an hour with a 140 return from the state rather than a 780 penalty	4
0	i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it boy are they right this thing is terrible after installing on windows xp sp2 as soon as i started the program it crashed now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner it crashes every time product is useless wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !	4
0	the product is so so there are others that do the same thing for a bit less but colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support you are screwed between putting you on hold for ever not calling back etc	4
0	do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy but this software is not easy to use you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand	4
0	this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip forcing the ribbon on the user assumes that the user likes icons \( i do n't what 's wrong with words \? \? \) and fills too much of the screen real estate nothing is where it should be and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views no classic view just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons another oppressive giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft	4
1	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
0	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4

1	i recently purchased this from a book club and it is a wonderful bible type is easy to read and the imitation leather binding cover is of high quality the various colors help guide you to passages of the same intent very innovative great	4
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4
1	product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition	4
0	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	4
0	do n't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates it corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you you will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software instead just follow these steps to keep your pc fast 1 run disk cleanup \( provided by xp \) 2 defrag your hard disk regularly3 clean the registry \( there are lot of free software available to clean your registry \) that 's all that you need to keep your computer fit no need to use softwares such as fix i	4

1	the product of windows xp professional is just what i was looking for with many updated features and i am looking forward in using it daily it was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it but most of all service was top knotch i could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems i may have had customer service is a plus i would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	4
1	good product however i do n't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time i open the program perhaps they should try to get it right the first time and it 's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me using it with quicken is a pita it is unclear to me how you get more than one state	4
1	i 've only been using this program for about a month its not a simple program for me for i'm not business savvy with help of a cpa and the wonderful tutorials and help program i'm getting the program and its working so well ! i love it	4

0	obviously bogus reviews version 6 was slow as a dog so any improvement will make this more interesting of course rasing the price to 300 and 450 is less interesting what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 \? how bout tossing us all a bone	4
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

1	the last reviewer did n't see any point to this software partially that 's true you do n't need it to create your photostamp you can do the same thing online however there is one big plus to the software product buying a single sheet of photostamps direct from their website costs 24 99 2 99 shipping at this writing in contrast amazon is selling this boxed version which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps for seven bucks less than that do the math	4
1	drills are excellent vocabulary has good variety picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language	4
1	i bought this program for my daughter for her birthday she wanted it because she 's used it at school \( 1st grade \) i was impressed by how easy it was to install i installed it as admin and she had no issues running it under her limited account \( xp pro \) i 've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program she even made valentine 's day cards for her whole class with it just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink	4
0	systemworks continues to grow taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer and i'm likely to buy an alternative next time i update note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer a new hard drive motherboard or processor and symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy i like the basic functions but there 's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	4

1	i'm planning a motorcylce trip in italy this summer and the program gives me all the info i need on routes and sites of intertest along the way overall a great product	4
0	this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix it turns them a light shade of grey maybe it is horrible this to me renders it useless it is for the most basic of users there are no real manual functions to speak of and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly i would say do not buy seller was great product is poor	4

0	i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti virus programs i purchased the 3 pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer when i contacted norton they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers i will never purchase another norton product	4
1	i purchased elements because frankly i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada i have found it to be pretty intuitive lots and lots of options as to organization photo tweaking and such i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos i do have two other imaging programs and with the addition of elements i feel like i'm basically well set with zillions of options plus there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples such as textures and so on very helpful get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program you will not be disappointed	4
1	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
1	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements	4

1	impressed with the way it clears out viruses spyware and trojans i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it that all goes well what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign me in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	4

0	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4

0	we were big fans of taxcut especially after turbo added spyware this year's tax cut has irreguarities that are costing \( \) me for example you file your college student 's return and check the box that she he will be an exemption on the head of household return then comes the surprise head of household ca n't file their return with that college student as an exemption despite checking the proper boxes ! for example it ca n't caluculate railroad retirement benefits for example it tells you that your return is a okay you pay 15 then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another 15 to refile ! good bye tax cut !	4

0	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4

0	i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage 2002 for years it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do n't think my latest sites would be up yet sorry i do n't mean to be mean it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically i'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade i do n't know	4

1	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4

0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
0	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4 0 is a downgrade from 3 0 performance is very poor especially the organizer it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera compared to elements recently i 've been getting lots of crashes though everything else on my system is completely stable the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality when it works correctly	4
1	i have used tax cut for several years have had no complaints it is easy to use and is very complete plan to use it again next year	4
1	i purchased this program simply for the encarta 2007 i was amazed at all of the wonderful features that microsoft put into the package i feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life enjoy it	4
1	ca n't say enough for it there is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all i 've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up they have been consistrantly excelant	4

0	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about 6 months of 'trying' to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	4
0	this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless	4
1	i have viewed pdf files for years never made one before the installation was simple and converting word excel or other files to pdf is one click away only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied	4
1	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	4
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles they are multi column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors in fact because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working way to go nuance	4
0	their approach might work for other languages but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language which rosetta stone never explains it simply displays four pictures at you with some incomprehensible \( to a beginner \) chinese near them and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures i 've taken chinese for two years and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it i either knew the words already or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online	4

0	talk about junk ! no search capability mislabeled cds some cds wo n't run in short yuk !	4
0	the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users it seems to have bugs too starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet but i'm close	4

1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
1	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4

0	i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version 14 and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version 14 and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base	4

1	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4
0	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4
1	i have used the hallmark card studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version i like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two	4
1	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4

1	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program my ear is now tuned to the language i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses my vocabulary still needs to get stronger but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french that is only a matter of practice with the language as advertised this program is painless and progress is rapid try the demo you 'll see	4

0	i have been a faithful mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids this game is a big disappointment the language game is virtually unplayable in french i am fluent in french and went to a french language university for nine years i could barely understand what the characters were saying if this program is intended to teach kids a second language it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead this game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of french	4

1	not a complicated application but it successfully repartitioned a 100g drive into 3rds on a new lenovo laptop with xp sp2 i would recommend using the dos version which you can get just by booting on the cd requires no install you can simply boot make the changes and it is done seems to be very straightforward and i would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with windows running	4

0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4

1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	4

1	look notation software is notoriously expensive all musicians know that so when you see songwriter and its price it 's a relief everything you need is in this program i only have one complaint when adding an expressive dynamic \( p mp mf f ff etc \) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes it leaves an ugly looking score other than that this is the best deal on the market for what it is	4
1	i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one the video tutorials are the greatest help of all the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want but that is not the easiest task i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true	4

0	this program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts it is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic the word bubble sdo not rotate so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to it looks really great on the cover of the cd and that 's what sold me it was a disapointing christmas	4
0	i tried unsuccessfully several times to install it i contact their alleged support they sent me what they deemed a fix the fix was awful it caused my computer to crash and print shop would never work broderbund used to be a good company but i 've had nothing but problems with their software of late they need to rethink their products their support and their company focus they are lousy at this point they obviously do n't give a dang about quality support or their customers	4

0	1 you ca n't print on anything over 8 5x14 paper useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale 2 i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3 0 of broderbund 3d home architect it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	4
1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
0	cakewalk s advertisement saying something like no experience needed to operate this software is in my mind mis leading at least and a down right lie at most i 've had it now for about three weeks work on it most days usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it and still cant get anything out of it all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work blues pop country so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen beware unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed	4

0	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual	4
1	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4
1	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
0	if you read the license you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print certainly ca n't sell them and ca n't let others copy them unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission you probably do n't want this software	4

1	if you 're looking for a professional office suite ms office 2007 has no real competitors i 've worked extensively with corel office and some with open office they 're fine for the basics and they cost less but if you 're looking for effectiveness integration speedy productivity and an incredible array of tools you 'll want to buy ms office 2007 and as an added bonus the interface makes it a pleasure to work in	4
0	although crayola is a wonderful brand i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them and they get frustrated it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture also it is not mess free the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch \( other than paper \) anyways i did not like how mushy the paint was i am still finding globs of it everywhere	5
1	vakama is very cool you must get him ! he wears the great mask of concelment and comes with a kanoka disk	5
1	my son loves this game when moving around the tracks in the one game it can be difficult the key is if you moving up or down depending on which direction you need to go push the joystick the direction once and let go after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go i hope this helps my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks mom dad and sis had to play before that the other games are a little easier but i found the games educational and my son loves it	5

0	this game was not at all what i expected the steering wheel and pedals are just for looks you actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel and many of the games had nothing to do with driving so glad i opened it to try it before christmas morning this is one toy that is headed back to the store	5
0	bought these beads for my 18 month old he enjoys taking them in and out of the container they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved	5

0	dont waste your money on this one the picture is cute but the quailty of the toy isnt any good the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child the concept is supposed to be like the game memory your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting your better off just buying the real memory game the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price	5

1	this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it it plays pre programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols \( like my daughter ! \) and it really is pretty we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played it also does a pretty light show i cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3 6 year old girls	5
0	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to	5

0	the truck gets clogged up often it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load the tower is decent albeit it does n't quite work as advertised as well our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way i grew up in the domino rally days and compared to the original toys these do n't stack up the truck and tower just are n't worth it you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails	5
1	i love it ! it 's really light weight and portble the batteries do go dead without the charger and the pvds should have more then 30 minutes 60minutes i like this video now alot calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it 's wonderful i hope you buy it !	5

0	bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily the level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it my only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages \( for the spiral binding \) the pages tend to be separated there so i think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength	5

1	this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc that is why i think it is educational to that respect my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along	5

1	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys my 2 and 3 year old sons enjoy playing with them no complaints here	5
1	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen it has a contrast adjustment but it not very helpful it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast	5

1	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product here i am fulfilling my promise they were able to pedal the bike within 2 3 days of getting them they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car \( 89 chevy camaro \) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns	5
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge the only downside are some of the very small pieces definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3	5
1	this is a single player game set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated by the end the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before both kids love it ages 4 and 9 we helped the four year old learn the tricks by just asking whoes in that cars way \? then whoes in the trucks way \? until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards	5

1	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7 he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships he would say where his ships were this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game	5

0	oh my gosh this is terrible ! my husband and i bought this game because i loved watching this as a child this game uses the same prizes and games over and over if you played once you have played too many times the games are boring the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time i do n't know why the box says 13 and up because my 10 year old daughter could play this this one is going back to the store i got zonked out of my 24 99 if you want my opinion take the cash and run	5
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games it is basically boring and ill conceived i have played it a few times with my kids and found it to be of no particular interest on any level it is neither fun exciting or challenging for them or me i strongly recommend you try a cranium game or how about chess \? \? \? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game is that it 's better than tv which is n't saying much	5
1	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5
1	this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer i enjoy watching him do the math \( one with the coins \) as well as watching him make words	5
0	my daughter got this for her 5th birthday and it really looks cute and fun in the box within 5 minutes of playing with it the small clip that holds the starfish open broke in addition the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic if your kids are like mine they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it this toy is really cute but not worth it save yourself the hassle buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in	5
0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	5
1	these weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets	5
0	all thomas the train products are overpriced there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price choose one of those ! save yourself some money	5
1	my 3 year old son loves this puzzle and has played with it for over a year he likes to put it together over and over again making a train across the floor it has really helped him to learn his alphabet and i highly recommend it !	5
1	we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it ! he does n't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them overall this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder we ca n't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun ! ! lego always makes great and challenging toys !	5
0	this toy is not what i had expected it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it	5
1	my 3 year old is very interested in space and loves this toy having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it the payload doors do n't really close the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on meets the need for a realistic shuttle though	5
1	i have a videonow player and i luv it ! ! ! there are over 100 discs !	5
0	my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise \( which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not \) and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either	5
0	i have bought quite a few barbies from amazon recently including the caligirl series fashion fever series and barbie loves micky mouse this barbie is quite different to all above she does not have a rubber skin like others so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts her foot is quite flat only the slippers in this package fit her all other barbies' shoes do not i guess this pooh might be made with the former generation technology	5
1	my son cannot wait to get a bigger set compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is by far better quality although it is also more expensive	5
1	my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well they love to pretend to be rock stars ! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control so you only get one level loud i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing	5
0	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
1	an unexciting piece of value only to the completist collector \( like myself \) there 's nothing wrong with it it 's just that there 's nothing great about it either the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a holographic figure hasbro could has done better by choosing another host sculpt to base this exclusive off of the phantom menace version was much better	5
1	apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered \( on time incidentially ! \)	5
0	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base \( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet \) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time	5
0	i recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years i was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup i was disappointed in the dice tray it is very flimsy and not properly designed it should have a rotator and be made of more durable material also the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals i felt ripped off when i discovered this obvious mistake	5
1	if ya trade toon worldu can use toons as regular monsters and the it wont make yacange the other guy plays toon world it jes works for if u play itand it plays on on the opone	5

1	i was very happy with the product i purchased and i received it in a timely fashion the product was not worn nor used it was as if i bought it at the store at a lower cost it was a win win for me thank you	5
0	this is probably one of the best booster packs out there every monster that comes in the pack has an effect effect monsters can be very useful not to mention that my very first pharaonic guardian pack came with a secret rare ! that is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack ! even the common cards are great such as giant axe mummy or the gravekeeper cards ! your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack ! i highly suggest this pack	5

1	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon it looks really cool and can change also the little ball launcher \( i forget what it 's called \) is a lot of fun \( i shot my brother with it x3 \) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it does n't really get in the way	5
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	5
0	bought this little cooler for the back of our atw wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well but this a totally soft sided cooler with no frame or supports so if there is anything in it the cooler does not hold it 's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon looks terrible and i would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin	5
1	i received this promptly and in time for vacation was great for the kids in the car they loved the stencils that came with the board many hours of fun they like that they can make skid marks with the lightning mcqueen car	5

1	my daughter \( age 13 \) really enjoyed this game it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that	5
0	my daughter loves this toy she has the treehouse and the school house she plays with them often my only complaint is that they fall apart she does not mind i just snap it back together and she keeps playing	5
0	this tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children my son who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn it would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard forget it this is an on pavement toy only	5
1	this toy is so cool ! i use it all the time with my friend erica you could text message each other and it even takes pictures my parents bought it for me at christmas they were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes ! this toy is so cool ! now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone ! ! ! i highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy !	5
0	this item is really small i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item in hindsight i would n't have order it had i paid more attention i think the other products from haba \( eggs and teabags \) are worth the money for the size	5
0	our daughters are four and five years old the skates will not fit over our five year old 's shoe the ad clearly says three to seven years old	5
0	my cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces however she can not even use the gift you need to buy the totally beadifully jewelry maker to use this kit no where in the online description of this toy on amazon does it tell you this toy is being returned b c we do n't have the bead maker	5

0	this pirate chest is a total rip off the chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal when i ordered it as a gift for someone they sent me someone else 's order then refused to let me return my item for a refund when i finally received it the company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all	5

0	my son was excited to get this for christmas after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed the arrows launcher never held the arrows as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet	5
1	my 5 year old daughter got this monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night since my 1 year old daughter loved her big sister 's monkey so we had to get her one of her own she loves it and sleeps with her monkey every night now	5
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas his eyes lit up when he saw it he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away we did n't of course we waited a whole day thank goodness it literally took an hour to put together there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different it was very frustrating then it would n't stay together once it was finished it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since he gets so upset when he tries to play with it we saved the box it 's going back if they will take it	5
1	this is a great simple fast game that is fun for all ages	5
1	my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain he was n't able to assemble it alone eventhough he 's typically very good at assembling most other toys it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together	5
1	the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child she had a great time using her magic wands to see what would happen with the bathroom playset having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool \( i assume so dora could step up to the sink brush her teeth \) pops out was a very fun surprise my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle the whole set was a great buy	5
1	it is a little smaller than i expected but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand other than that it 's perfect my son 's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box so far it 's worked out great ! i do n't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small do n't bother me the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank	5
1	we had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one my girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make the music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them \( ages 20 months and 3 1 2 \)	5
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	5
0	i purchased two of these hand held deal or no deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys the boys found that they had trouble indicating that they 'd like to take the deal when the pressed the button to say yes to the deal the game continued as if they said no deal they got annoyed but kept on playing i tried the game thinking that they did something wrong but i also had the same problem i'm annoyed because the game was 20 each and i think it does n't work properly !	5
0	ok as far as novelty goes these ducks are soooo funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky ! ! ! i bought them for my 1 year old just because i am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky anyone who feels this lil duck toy is devil worship to has some serious issues and i would suggest they need to seek some professional help so for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because i think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight	5
0	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago but without the adult 's handle my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself and we generally like the style but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model	5
0	what a super cheap rip off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid '70 's seems like every doctor 's office break room friend 's basement etc had one of these cubes to kill time with main reason that i personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two the colored stickers start to peel off the rubik 's cube had it 's day in this high tech age i cannot see many kids having any interest in this item they might actually have to 'use' their brain please do n't bring back the pet rock	5
0	this love ball was very un lovely the messages would not appear clearly in the window no matter how i tried turning it over different ways maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before i received it i put it back in the box and plan to ship it back	5

0	these were a gift to my 5 year old from his grandmother i ca n't return it to her since it would make her feel worse than the worthless product i'm amazed amazon carries them ! a string and two cans would work better	5
1	my two year old has several of these cars and the race track he loves all things cars so these were a big hit all of the shake and go cars talk before they run which he especially likes they are very easy for a toddler to operate but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them too they do n't run for very long per shake but that does n't seem to bother him at all	5

0	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	5
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected about 4 inches long i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package it 's a pull back and go car and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels they were wobbly from then on this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell very dissappointed	5
0	i never imagined i was going to be such a bad experience when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side then the game is complicated and it is not balanced so everybody will choose the dark side because they have advantages dont waste you money buying this game better buy the normal risk acquire or axes and allie	5
0	i bought this toy last year for me son he really did not care for the toy at all but he loves elmo the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast	5
0	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5

1	this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby i 've used this toy in two different setting \( first as a nanny and then as a mom \) and both times the babies were terrified of it it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going unless of course you 've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls \( which seems to be half the fun for them \) good toy but not until maybe 14 months	5
1	bought this one recently for my eight year old \( and myself \) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy	5
1	i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it the price is great right now especially with free shipping she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories more than worth the low price i'm going to stock up on a few more for misc gifts the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories	5
0	what a disaster it takes too long then you get a tiny gross little blob of cotton candy it is quite a mess to clean then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed my 5 year old wants to know how santa 's elves made such a stinky bad toy expect to be disappointed with this one	5

0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	5
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle when my nephews come over they always find these and they 're 5 and 7	5
0	my 4 yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just does n't do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one	5
1	i love light sabers i got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play i bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool this saber is the best you can fight and the saber will not get damage i like it very much i got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight the light saber full extended is like 3 4 of a meter but it do his job the electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment the force be with you	5
0	i am not too happy with this item it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well	5
1	i was happy to order this early so they would n't run out but i later saw the same set at a local store there was only one left on the shelf so i'm glad i ordered them anyway they are my youngest son 's favorite cars to start off with every morning	5

1	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game but once learned it is a lot of fun a good game for four players and a great game for six players it generates lots of lively action with the bidding for the cards we played this game on a cruise with four strangers they were no longer strangers after the game everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it that 's how we got it bought the game after playing with family	5

0	i support the comments that others make this game is so poorly designed it is laughable i cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once forget trying to follow the directions they left out many important rules the board does n't work especially the way the pieces fit into it and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner what is up with that \? forget this game	5
0	compared with the sound sensation blocks i bought together to my 3 month babies this product is almost ignored by them	5
1	we purchased this set for my son christmas 2003 he loves it the age range on the listing is off though it should be the same for any of the little people toys 12 or 18 months and up there are no small parts highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time	5
1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1 and 2 year old children it 's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my 2 year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my 1 year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up	5

0	the pieces of this toy \( the outfits etc \) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet also the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing in general this toy is hokey and cheap i recommend melissa and doug 's magnetic dress up and ormagnetic princess dress up all the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together also the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized	5

1	my daughter really wanted this for christmas she really has played and played with it ever since i wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product	5
0	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within 60 seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise	5
0	big disappointment cheaply made t rex model does not snap together can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded microscope less functional than a magnifying lens volcano is ok the plaster does work but you must provide ingredients for the eruption weather center very very flimsy and breaks i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product supplies for crystals subpar for what is required was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons	5
0	i got this puzzle for my three children \( age 5 4 and 2 \) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds so removing one means it does n't work the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking but why buy a toy which makes you worry \? we were really disappointed	5
0	this game was not engaging my son did not find it interesting he has not asked to play with it again you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance try what 's gnu it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults	5
1	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
0	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over there is only one good thing about it the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going this helped my daughter learn to pedal the constant nose dive however was not worth it do n't buy !	5
0	no wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks it does not work and the quality is sub par i have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst i have seen do not take if it was free garbarge and disappointment await i gave one star because you have to but i would give negitive stars if i could	5
1	i love this playpen ! ! durable plastic can be extended to larger size \( or shortened if going someplace that is not as large \) only problem is that my baby loves to wander she is not thrilled when mommy cages her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary crib toys can be safely attached on the sides \( did that with her aquarium toy which she loves and it soothes her \) occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her i just put her other toys in for her to play with	5
1	i received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift i started to get into sudoku a few months ago while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go there are n't many buttons so it 's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work hope this helps	5
1	this thing is great anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off it will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them funny funny funny ! ! ! ! you can use fairly light objects you can use trip cords and you can use trip cord like devices too and probably much more that i have never thought of good luck good fun and good hunting ! sam kochel p s hope this was a helpful review	5

0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5

0	i brought this because my kids love spongebob ice cream perfect toy right \? wrong ! the ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob 's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone we have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then i have a huge mess left in the kitchen	5
0	my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday she loves tub toys but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water my daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it quot swim quot on the floor i'm a big fan of sassy toys but i 'd pass on this one	5
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play this was how i learned how to play the game i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above \( 90 's style \) unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me	5
1	imaginext dinosaurs' t rex is quite simply fun to play with the dinosaur not only is a great toy with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar it comes with a catapult with its respective stones \( 2 \) that the caveman \( also included with accessories \) can operate to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino my 3 year old picked it up since he got it and he has n't let go	5
1	i found that for the price this set was great ! it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go 3 and a half feet there were also some improvements in the pieces for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set	5
0	i bought this for my boyfriend as a present we both love the tv show and thought the game would be as exciting \( without the live crowd of course \) but the game moves slow no models only picking case numbers you can compete against one another but its not really exciting maybe you should try the board game version it ca n't be any worse	5
1	we all love this toy what i like about it is that it 's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it 's sturdy \( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard \) it looks good not cheap and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes this has been the big hit this christmas even more so than tekno puppy	5
0	when i received the punching nun and removed her from the package her halibut fell off the glue holding her black cape on did n't hold either i would n't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up	5

0	this game fell apart after we got out of the box i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart be careful i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys	5
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection we did n't use it as a game you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them yes the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue would buy this again great for kids with imaginations	5
0	we went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water adding the package of sea monkeys and finally feeding the sea monkeys and nothing happened \( \) hope these are not dead	5
0	this elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night i had to ship the first one back to fp on my own dime to get a new one that one was broken as well ! the cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the abc part does not work this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on ! what a pain ! shoddy electrical work i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat make sure you get this garbage on sale !	5
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for the snow was much grainer than i had expected i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that instant snow was very fine and really looked like snow this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture	5
1	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	5
1	this is a great game ! using clues to get others to say the secret word another great classic game brought back by endless ! a	5

0	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day upon receipt it was not operable the user is supposed to ask the love ball a question and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid	5
0	not only did this phone not work but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up the flashing light was distracting and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all and where the heck was the texting \? \? \? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone but you can only get 0 calls froim it and really limited reception in the mountains switch to a razr as soon as possible	5
1	the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable and the sounds it makes are truly neat my daughter got this over a year ago \( she is 7 now \) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs	5
0	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store it was not worth the money it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better i wish i had known that before i spend 10 on this piece of junk	5
1	whenever we take this bike to the park boys and men of every description crown around it in awe my son who is seven and so far not athletic at all loves the recognition not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching we just wish it came in an adult size	5
1	this train table is a nice size bigger than i expected it went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson 's thomas stuff it seems to be made as well as what i saw at toys r us for double the price	5
1	my 9 month old received this for christmas and loves it ! he is not quite crawling yet he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy so far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze the voice and phrases it says are so very cute too we love the little giggle and when it says hello baby ! ! this is an adorable toy	5
0	this product is terrible the very essence of su doku is logic reasoning this product leaves everything to guesswork i returned it ate the postage was happy to be rid of it ! i then downloaded shareware from the palm store to my palm pilot for 10 could n't be happier	5
1	another nice product from playdough worth the ten bucks or so we just bought this fromamazon this would make a cute birthday present for a young child say 2 to 8 \? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage i would buy this again as a gift	5
0	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead im 11 yrs ol	5

0	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed now the darn thing does not respond to her answers even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock much more fun	5
1	a lot of fun ! the kids really enjoy this updated version of their favorite game product was shipped promptly !	5
0	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1 2 years \( unless small for their age \) my 4 yr old son \( 36lbs \) got it for his birthday and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car but its been parked since broken i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted the plastic seems cheaply made the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well stickers have already started to flake peel off after 1 month consider a bigwheel	5
0	this is a very cute and realistic set the measurements are all accurate the whisk is very dangerous though it is metal one of the things came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away if you buy this item make sure get rid of the whisk !	5
1	my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy when you think it 's pushed down all the way you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise also like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean but overall the toy is fun and very durable	5
0	again the graphics are horrible the mat is boring and not colorful my 3 1 2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b c they are so faded she used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since complete waste of money	5
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play	5
0	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas i would have sent it back if it had not been from santa	5
1	this chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process only draw back there really is n't enough room to track chores for more than one child	5
0	i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway it was the worst gift i 've ever bought please do n't even waste your money trust me check the reviews first now that 's worth it	5
0	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times our version did not include the 5 ways to play as stated on the box \( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch \) my 4 year old who received the gift lost interest after the first time he played both of my boys love the i spy and can you see what i see books this game just was n't challenging enough for them	5
1	yesterday we where buying the christmass presents when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes when i got home i began building it after 6 hours i finished it and when i tried everything was going all right so it was n't that difficult	5
0	i bought this for my 7 year old son it did not take long before the a and b buttons became stuck in the down position the games were not that challenging for a 7 year old but he thought it was great when the a and b buttons fouled up he said it made it more of a challenge dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap	5
0	i received my order today and discovered \( as with all of the hasa products in my order \) that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small 2 1 2 x 1 that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	5
0	gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday it was supposed to be easy to fly it rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight spewing propeller parts everywhere with all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly if you buy this heli do n't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together	5
0	i purchased the havoc heli for my dad he saw an ad for it on tv and wanted one so i was excited that amazon com had it for a lower cost and free shipping however that was as far as the good went my dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the havoc heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it but it had a difficult time flying without any extra weight this helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc but it does make a cute little paperweight	5

0	i cannot believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model \( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! \) after some resistance they agreed to refund me and they did the back wheels are too close together making it very easy to tip over plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable i tried it too in the store on smooth ground but on the sidewalk forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !	5
1	this toy is great for many reasons ! ! tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters you get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers ! each character has point value and rarity if you 're lucky you might get one of the very rare tengamos and sell it for on ebay ! you can also play hundreds of games with the tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack hurry to collect all of series 1 before it is retired for series 2 highly recommended	5
1	my infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets i'm sure she will grow into this toy i do wonder how i'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth	5
1	if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong	5
1	my son calls this a flute and rather than argue we let it go but his little hands have a hard time holding it \( he 's 4 \) even i have trouble i'm right handed and the right hand keys are on the bottom i do n't know if that 's how real clarinets are but it 's awkward also your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play so that 's also a little frustrating but the sound is great and it 's fun to play once you get the hang of it	5
1	the checkbook package was opened no pieces were missing but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift	5
0	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater but a house cave secret hideout restaurant and schoolhouse very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws etc it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it the front panel that the child rest 's his her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater other than the durability factor great product	5
1	i bought this item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great i highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son	5

0	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition however the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see after we opened the cards \( two sets were purchased \) we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside down the cards are also not particularly sturdy these cards appear to be irregulars	5

1	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	5
0	i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer 's description one picture seems to have been deleted now the manufacturer 's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash i trusted that the manufacturer 's description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all it is very simple with vinyl wings be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect	5
0	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection i was wrong it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no mountain of bubbles this product does n't work save your money ! !	5

1	this is the toy with the background music and she 'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance	5
0	all the cut shapes are the same so it 's very easy for my 3 1 2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place the pieces also seem thin and flimsy the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox carrycase all in all the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger the ravensburger thomas giant floor puzzle \( 24 pc \) is a far superior product but no longer complex enough for my kid	5
0	this trike in useless ! our 2yr old tips over every time she tries to ride it buy something that 's worth the money and safer ! now our daughter wo n't go near the thing or any other trike ! i expected much better from radio flyer	5

1	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
0	this is a very cute set however it 's not very well made and the holders are free standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem with kids the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over disappointing	5
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book so the kids like to compare it this product is very durable and will last	5

0	this thing just does n't work do n't bother it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it looks like it would be fun if it worked the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason	5
0	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew and how to thread both top and bobbin threads my daughter received this machine for christmas we threaded it according to directions it sews about 10 stitches then jams i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing and leads to a jam every time do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this	5
0	this item had a description for ages three and up this is n't even close now i'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five year old who is so attached to the fact it 's a batmobile he can get in even if his knees practically knock at his chin that i 'll never pry it from him he 's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months it was a complete waste of money it 's suited for two to three year olds and small four year olds	5
0	do n't waste your time with this thing by the time we invested in the toy the batteries etc we had quite a few dollars into it for about 15 minutes of fun the toy ca n't just be set down on a table so when my son actually gone bored with it \( to my shock because he loves bubbles \) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over yuck mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash this toy is just a gimmick stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money	5
1	my 6 year old loves this yes it is small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right on a shelf when not being played with i would get it again if i did not already have it	5
0	this vehicle is nothing but junk it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a 100 00 toy very disappointed i would like to send it back for a full refund	5
0	my daughter \( 3 at the time \) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs \( 24 total pieces \) i would avoid this game entirely	5
1	i have been in love with this game ever since i first played it was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in chicago since i have moved i keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home it is great for all ages we are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun it does n't matter who wins as long as we play play play we laugh laugh laugh !	5
0	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i cannot tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could	5
1	this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family ! it is very fun and great for little ones too ! i own this game and my family enjoys it very much this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson 's idenity i love this game and i think you would too	5
1	my son absolutely loves his animals he can sit and play with the book for awhile he 's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs it was a great gift and i recommend it ! i do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs	5
1	i like the set up it looks like a daycare really appears it is great to spur on your childs creativity and role playing skills	5
1	this is a great item theres alot going on in such a tiny little space the detail is great from the kraken that can make a boat disappear to the bone cage there 's a collapsing bridge a collapsing building a trap door runaway mill and a cool magnetic boat race and more it comes with jack will norrington and the cannibal chief but no davy that was a little disappointing but anyway its a fun item for all ages	5
0	the board for this game is a pain half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick it takes forever and a day to look in the book locate the letters' locations and uncover them too i love wheel of fortune but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle	5
1	not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother in law ! quite realistic looking ! it works great on smooth surfaces but does n't do well on carpet our dogs got a big kick out of it	5
0	i popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever i even put in a different set up batteries still no dice this is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever i am sorry that i will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill after the reading the other reviews perhaps i am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound i gather that i'm not missing much	5
1	first i have to say thank you to amazon for having this game this was on my daughter 's christmas list and amazon was the only place i could find it second my daughter loves this game and so do her friends they have played the game more than any other she received	5
1	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 we bought a lot of m d toys and this by far was the better of their toys even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out like other said the sound is very appropriate i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful	5
1	you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy \( or wanted a trailer for the truck \) but this is an updated version of the original character as opposed to a remake and is superior in many ways it is durable detailed well articulated and fun especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot i 'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike	5
0	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again \( if you know how to turn the sound off let me know i'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire \) do not buy this toy you 'll be very disappointed in it	5
1	we purchased this game for our son for christmas he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess he has enjoyed the game all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition it is an attractive box we are very pleased with every aspect of it	5
1	transaction went well grandkids are having a blast at using the product innovatively with lots of fun and excitement	5
1	the v4 the newest american tamagotchi is much like its previous japanese counterparts the entama and uratama this tamagotchi goes to school interviews for jobs and then has a career each career has its own game so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail	5
0	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops great height for a small kid but difficult to adjust latch always got stuck also after a few months the latch broke right off now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son now it is just a 30 peice of trash	5
1	i appreciate the previous reviews but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them my family ages 4 6 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game we played until we had a winner \( not too long \) and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner just our opinion but we had a good time	5
0	i bought it for my son to use with the original pixter also and i found what it was compatible with after i realized that it did n't work with the original pixter the box i have says down in the bottom right corner \( if the back of the box is facing you \) of the back of the box in tiny print compatible with pixter plus and pixter 2 0 you would think they would put that on the front	5
1	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way there is a lot more room for more logs 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front i ended up buying additional logs \( not lincoln logs \) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	5
0	we were really excited about this item but have been very disappointed we followed the directions exactly even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks \( which was frustrating and a pain in the neck \) and still we have nothing growing after weeks and weeks of waiting ! rotten thing to do to a kid ! the plastic dome is of decent quality and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller worked out much better this is a total waste of time and money unfortunately	5
0	my 5 1 2 year old son received this for christmas he loves pirates and legos so it seemed a perfect fit we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made and it 's very difficult \( even for an adult \) to get the pieces to stay together imagine how frustrating this is for a child we will never purchase mega bloks products again we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration thanks megabloks	5
1	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it he helps with the house cleaning i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch sprays water and pretend buttons he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet we play iron with the water when i have time this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time sigrid manon blake ramire	5

1	it 's amazing how much a child learns by having access we are an american family living in germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives	5
0	this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close there 's a much better model of an x wing out there do a web search for a company called fine molds it 's a japanese company that makes a finely detailed 1 72 scale x wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle including standing seated pilot figures different droid types it 's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for	5
0	our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity in fact i would like to know this myself	5
0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try i have two complaints with this product one the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone	5
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together	5
0	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third party retailers	5
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy not worth the price would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense	5
0	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review i am extremely disappointed the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola	5
1	love this game with family and or friends it 's one of the best card games around it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention \( you can watch movies talk hang out etc \) yet keeps your interest it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame	5
1	it says some silly things which might not make us laugh but overall a cute toy and kids will like i	5
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey there are no other ones like it they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth they love it	5
0	this is a horrible edition of this game it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all save some money and buy the old boxed editions from or get the newest version you 'll like it a lot more	5
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday he loved it ! but after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it he still plays with it a little bit but not like when it made noise i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month	5
0	this was given to my 2 year old as a present it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with the concept is good all the animals and farmer are built very well but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together	5
0	i love legos however i too was not real impressed with the 50th anniversary tub the lego com websites description of the contents each bucket includes lego system bricks in your favorite lego colors plus a handful of gold colored bricks ! let 's be real we 're talking a child 's handful not adult my daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket another child i know got 4 his brother 5 the duplo set i bought had 6 if you 're buying for the gold bricks it 's not worth the money	5
1	this is a great lego set my 1 1 2 year old son loves them he crashes the truck and caravan all the time and they never break he really likes the bob and cat that come with it these are also the right size to use with the bob click brick sets this truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks	5
1	this was ordered for our 4 year old she just loves it ! very realistic features size of set quality is why fisher price is still the very best for imaginations of all ages ! !	5

1	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory	5
1	lots of fun for young children my kids ages 2 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets	5
0	i recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it did n't work ! i contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and i returned it to them i am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them	5

1	got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she played with well more like laid and stared at now she 's 4 1 2 months old and she still loves it she loves to grab at the fish shake the rattle and twirl the lobster for awhile it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom music is n't too annoying either	5
1	this is a quality product good detail holds air well ready to blow up and hang from attached loop an excellent buy	5
0	a torture device disguised as a toy how would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell \? might as well go lick some dirty socks i think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash hey ma why does slinky go down but not up \? who 's the genius who found this at the scrapyard \? most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind 's perverse craving for repetition and or irritation	5
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it how could i not buy it for him doing that \? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house as he gets older he is liking it more and more	5
1	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the classic collection children of all ages \( and adults \) can build ships planes houses whatever the mind imagines in a variety of colors the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character this is a great product	5
1	i bought this mostly for the container i had individual play doh products like the barber set that came in it 's own box i'm able to put all play doh things into this container and everything is in one spot no more boxes and sorting i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience i'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !	5
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short lived it was nearly impossible to assemble the time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils	5
0	our son received this toy for his first birthday it has a lot of good features teaches colors numbers farm animals and their sounds several songs but the music is awful the singer is off key on every single song \( either that or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice \) as someone who appreciates music i cannot tolerate listening to this especially since there are far better toys out there since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy \( the learning table which has much better quality music and the fridge farm \) we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy	5
0	my 4 year old really wanted this for christmas after looking at similar products we chose this one should have spent the money on the one w the dvd tutu is way too small fits her 18 doll mat is a little too sensitive she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads only 2 instructions feet up feet down on the other arms up arms down bar is n't very stable company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat my daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it	5
1	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it he plays with it just about everyday everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too they all love trying to make baskets the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !	5
0	game did n't work but amazon was very accomodating with a refund including shipping	5
1	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run this was an upgrade add on and well worth it the motorized elevator keeps the action going a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily safe pieces easy construction and good directions fun even for the adults	5
1	the doll looks nothing like the aidan in the movie actually his face is kind of funny looking the movie aidan is cuter the doll could definitely have been made better	5
1	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend the quality is what i expected works fine	5
0	followed all directions added fish within hours the fish were sleeping on the bottom of the tank luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water added fish 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better something is seriously wrong with this tank bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what they are doing great ! do not put fish in the shark tank they will die	5
0	this marble maze looks so fun and cute however it 's actually useless and incredibly frustrating the pieces do n't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them much less when you try to roll a marble through them also the configurations pictured on the box do n't work at all either our giraffe is missing a critical piece or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate ugh i'm returning this immediately	5
1	awesome music and interaction fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs gets the kiddo very involved transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside	5
0	i agree with the other reviews my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift none of the pieces stay together at all how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together why the horse wo n't stand up why the barn doors keep falling off and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it	5
0	although my 3 1 2 yr old loves this belt it barely fits him it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go in fact my 1 1 2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face my son loves it for the brief time it sort of fits him but i am disappointed with the quality and the size	5
1	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list	5
0	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months after the one on christmas morning did not function at all the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days the graphics are straight from 1981 and the dancing princesses even make roboty bendy noises as they move very strange and disappointing	5
1	satisfied with the overall quality of the product also with the purchase process	5
1	makuta is sooooooo cool ! i love his giant staff pitchfork i think he is one of the best bionicles there is ! probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo body special bionicle	5
1	classic durable fun educational for kids of all ages including me	5
0	my 3 year old daughter and i have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand the design is nice it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice however after using it twice the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted this makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place it makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving my daughter was frustrated i eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child i do n't recommend this wand	5
1	my son likes this item the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium the only thing i did n't like about putting this together was the elevator very tight fit and does n't like to go up or down easily but everyone likes playing with it from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds	5
1	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
0	the horse does n't stay hooked on to the carriage too well it always comes apart it 's a pain it 's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing it 's cute to look at but my daughter lost interest in it quickly	5
0	our boys had a good time with this toy but after a 5 6 launches it broke ! not just the wings but the plastic body i feel like it was a waste of money and over priced	5
0	fisher price is selling the same item for only 33 139 99 has to be a mistake	5
0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses even though we purchased it as a play bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams	5
1	this is fun not easy for 5 and under but great for the rest of us \( 7 65 \) gave us alot of laughs	5
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap	5
1	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it his little sister who is two also loves this game this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept there are no complex rules to learn so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off	5
1	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son in law monopolize them with their little competitions these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy	5
0	i am so glad we tested this product ahead of time as a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them these walkie talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet' yes i said feet we gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of midlands do n't waste your money on these	5
1	this is a great pack for a day trip to grandmas it only holds about 4 cassettes so if you have a lot of books you should go with the zipper case other than that my daughter loves it	5
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's the children are learning as they play i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story this educational toy is very engaging the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote	5

0	i have to agree with the other on here i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead i tried and did n't think it was all that fun either i threw the box away and i'm sure i need that to return it if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use	5
1	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3 year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling the ac adapter is a life saver for long car trips just as an aside note the adapter does not look like the one in the picture it is gray and orange like the adapters you seen in the store	5
1	i bought this wireless weather station as a gift the recipient loves it for the price he is really enjoying it the only things he would change are interface to computer so that data could be tracked display of actual barometric pressure valuethese two features are available on more expensive models so i imagine in the future we will be upgrading	5

0	i was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use however the new type of valve does not hold in the air it says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one i bought would not stay in and when i tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated it would have been perfect had the valve worked properly	5
0	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store or they ran out of color at the factory my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one not like the box or commercial !	5

1	i had read about evacuators on a few forums it works as described no complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts that said perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve the fill drain capability looked appealing but if you do n't need to use this device to fill fluids i would opt for the drain only device less moving parts fewer things can fail	6
0	well i bought two of these i put it in my car in less then a week both of them ripped in the middle area i expected it to last a little longer \? \? i guess ill try sewing it back together or somethin	6

1	plugged the unit in a few weeks after i purchased it i was heading down to va for a reunuion \( 8 hr trip \) set it up facing backwards so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan the unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas cheese and veggies cool throughout the unit is quiet did n't really know it was running unless i had the engine off could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats overall got what i paid for and the unit worked as advertised	6
1	its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off i dont really buy any of those as seen on tv items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping remember this works best when over about 40mph and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea	6

0	very dissapointing the inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims	6
1	even if i could have only used this once for the 8 or so dollars it cost it would be worth it for how quickly and easily i was able to rid my apartment of dust sort of like a cheesy carnival game except i ended up with a dust free home just shake it off and it looks a tad grey from remaining dust but continues to pick it up amazingly well i bow before it 's greatness and just hope it lasts although if i need to buy a new one in a few months i 'll do it in an instant	6

1	owning 2 mercedes it is a pain to drain normally using the mityvac you insert the hose pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil my only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid the resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum still it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it i also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use it was a real time saver on the differential since i did not have to break the gasket for the cover	6
1	well made tool can seem to be a bit heavy cleans well it was shipped lazer fast	6
1	an excellent tool works perfectly easy to use and was able to diagnose and facilitate correction of several nuisance trouble codes in a tundra	6
0	gimmick there are a number of rerouting oil change kits available why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail \? the oil filter seals itself very well on most engines while it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles i would n't risk hose failure for a little convenience on my toyota truck i discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter i'm not sure that many people even change their own oil it 's cheaper to take it to the toyota dealer 29 95 and they even rotate the tires	6
1	it is really very nice and my colleague would like to buy that too they made my car looks very comfortable	6
0	we were expecting more of a cushion feel to this seat but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving it would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe but for a cushion its flat and cheap feeling as for king size it barely covers our car 's seat we ended up returning them not worth it	6
1	i bought this to use on a bmw motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims it works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you ca n't see the readout the readings are consistent with other gauges which i believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described	6

0	installed my bulldog 2030 ! it 's is a total piece of junk it only works when you tap on the hood you can pound on the back of the car and nothing put the sensor at max still nothing ! this is more of a novelty not an alarm its a freaking joke ! do n't waste your money	6
1	great product ! this tool is very intuitive and easy to use i find the greatest value is in having the mil codes internal to the device which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips i bought the obdii fault code book but quickly learned that i did n't need to have it	6

1	you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	6
1	i got two of these for the front seats of my toyota suv they are very cute just like the picture but the backgrounds are a jungly green not black which i expected from the picture however the green goes great with my interior so i'm very pleased with these seat covers	6

1	i have a stainless steel table top and was very disappointed when trying to clean it with standard household cleaners most cleaners would only leave a dull finish and streaks i saw this product specifically for stainless steel and tried it the results are stunning a light spray and quick wipe with a cotton cloth leaves a dramatic bright and shiny surface no rubbing no scrubbing no fuss it 's worth it to have this one trick pony in your cleaning arsenal	6

0	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	6

1	i wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models this gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use my favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve with other gauges you have to put in air then check the gauge put in air check it again with this gauge you can overinflate your tires a little bit then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired psi assuming this lasts a long time i would recommend it to everyone	6

0	if this gauge cost 20 i would give it a high rating but even at the discounted 35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value let alone the nearly 50 it cost me ! as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool not just cold temps general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway i would not buy again	6

1	all of my 2 hitch units work fine with this adapter i downsized from a suv with a 2 and went to a compact car with a 1 1 4 this allows me to use my bike carriers luggage racks etc	6
1	ordered mine directly from motive products for about the same price mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective after emailing motive they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing the unit worked as advertised a bit slow but be patient remember to warm up the engine a bit \( as directed in the instructions \) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out beats crawling under the vehicles and struggling with the oil pan nut ! will try bleeding brakes with it next time	6
1	the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of it took too long well that would be because you did n't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing idiot if you follow the directions this thing works great 5 stars i would buy it again in a heartbeat	6
1	hi alli am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me it has the features i wanted it to have and is very easy to use	6
1	this carrier is very good only one draw back the zipper only went around on two sides would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap	6
1	i kept getting tickets in the mail for going through ez pass tool booth out here in new york city my sticker was valid and i had money in my account they had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail each time i wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets they told the system had problems and they would fix it well i put a stop to it when i ordered 2 reflectors for my cars i have not had any tickets in the mail since i love this product it is so simple and yet effective everyone should get it the best 50 i have spent lately	6

1	wow ! i couldnt believe that they actually made a hitch for my sports car the car manual said that it is not possible to put a hitch on the rx8 but i really wanted one to accomodate my hitch bike rack i ordered this one and it fit perfectly in fact the holes in the hitch mounting bar lined up with holes already in the car frame like the car was designed to accept this hitch ! it only took me about one hour to install didnt even have to remove the tires or jack the car up ! very easy installation	6

1	although i have not tried other models of the california duster i really like this design since this model has dusting tassles all the way around you simple rotate the duster after each wipe this will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot this design also works well for dusting the underside of my car 's spoiler the duster really does capture dust and not just push it around my only complaint is that the re usable storage bag should be larger than it is to make it easier to get the duster back into it	6
1	this is the best ! ! ! best store best service fast service and great packageing i will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	6
1	i purchased it about a year and half ago it still does the job however i recently noticed that the duster does not work as well as in the beginning	6
0	this thing does not install in seconds as suggested it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you 're supposed to put in the window with it who want 's to fool with that everytime \? it also says to not use with tinted windows something that could have been mentioned here	6
0	advertised as easy to install just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it wrong if your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle they also do n't tell you it is not compatible with motorcycle relays if you get past all of this it does have a great sound	6
0	i'm very pleased with this laser garage park this laser garage park was easy to install and works really well i would recommend this to any one looking for a practicalway to avoid damage to their car while trying to park in thegarage	6
1	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6
1	had scanner for just over a year and have used it on chrysler dodge and ford both obdi and obdii vehicles works great ! simple menu driven instructions and pick lists make using this scanner very easy to use	6
1	i have a 06 corvette and 05 explorer and i use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes they work well and seem safe and strong \( you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure \) with the vette the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage \( if you are worried about it rubbing you could use two 1x4 's in front of the ramps for additional clearance \) the ramps are about 6 25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me \( 250lbs \) under the vette nice product	6
1	i have n't had to use it too much thank goodness but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind i did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great love it	6
0	i own both the original unbreakable autolock \( with the flat key \) and the autolock pro \( with the round key \) the original autolock never failed to open after 10 years of use on two cars the autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use this is not a key problem because i could not open it with two original keys i eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it i recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device	6
1	i have a honda which i love but since i do not drive her on a daily basis now the battery is tempermental i bought this product and have had to use it several times i 've found it easy to use and even when the car battery has been completely dead this jumpstarter has had more than enough power to get her started i comparison shopped and the price of this black decker was the best bargain too recommend it highly	6
1	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a treo 650 so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the treo 650 skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a treo 650 i also see they have these for the blackberries	7
1	easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others protects well and does not hinder any functions	7
0	save your money the eargels split in two days i used regular ear buds on the large size they did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality if you want the small and med i 'll send them to you for shipping i have no use for them	7

0	i received 2 2 5mm to 3 5mm stereo headphone adapter one did n't work the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality if you push the headphone jack \( male \) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers and even then the quality is not good	7
1	it is great ! you have to buy it believe me do n't waste your time looking for another case this is the best	7
1	i simply wanted a data cable to connect my verizon cell phone to my macintosh so i could transfer and synchronize data verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on windows machines this thrifty cable \( lt 10 \) worked perfectly with the mac friendly datapilot software	7
0	chargers work great and are a great bargain however the generic lg driver software that comes with the usb cable to transfer music from computer to phone does n't have an authenticity signature i do n't know about other computers but mine with windows xp \( sp2 \) wo n't accept it	7
1	i love this phone cover it looks amazing i am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached	7
1	i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from \? wich colors are there \? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee please answere asap	7
0	this stuff is n't even worth 14 99 my husband and my aunt could n't even hear me it 's a piece of crap i sent it back the same day don't buy it ! !	7
0	motorola one is far better in quality as well to use	7
1	i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life i had to charge my old battery everyday i only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days	7
1	the treo600 has all the functions i needed phone calendar camera etc two shortcomings 1 \) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that 's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo6502 \) the phone failed to dial two times in two months i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem	7
1	i ordered this headset in silver webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really is silver ! we argued about the color and i finally convinced them that samsung makes white silver red and black it took almost a month to get resolved but i finally have the silver headset that i ordered it is very small light and easy to use there are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit the headset gets 4 stars webtreo only gets 1 star i would n't order any products from them again	7
0	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
1	i love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one it is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing i highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff	7
1	product was what was offered and came quickly no hassle great seller and amazing price	7
0	do n't waste your money after 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2 year service agreement i opted to purchase a new battery waste of money ! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re charge nightly that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery nightly re charge	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
0	i returned this phone after one week currntly the motoral software has a glitch and you ca n't assign specifice ring tones to phone number ear piecs sound quality is marginal text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small the back panel display is too small and hard to read	7
1	this case was a perfect fit for my mot v180 phone the top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it ca n't easily fall out \( a problem that i 'd had with a different product \) the part that slips over the top of the phone has a built in see through window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case the quality of construction looks to be pretty good too	7
1	products exceeded my expectations the charger was n't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable i was n't interested in the case but after i got it i found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal	7
0	it took a week and half to receive it 3 days to get confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail then there 's a single protective screen pre cut in a plastic it does n't cover well the whole screen surface \( it 's about 1 2 mm narrower \) and it 's very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath i had to take it off immediately then once removed from place it 's a waste	7
0	snaps on easy but snaps off easy too it also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do this case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line	7
1	these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they 're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying	7
0	yes the cable fits but the cd driver is just for the 8300 i was not able to get it working	7
0	the headset really has bad sound quality i missed the reviews before i ordered i should n't have bought it considering the quality of the headset i did n't even try the car charger in the fear that it would n't follow the necessary battery charge cycle	7
1	idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places with this cover it is definatly protected i do n't like the smoke color but who really cares for the price	7
0	i encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle as soon as i got this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction the main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok \( not the 100 meters that it claims \) as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes	7
1	the holster that samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster how stupid is that \? why would samsung supply this type of holster to their customers \? however this holster has solved that problem you can now flip open your phone when using this holster thank yo	7
1	younger brother just got the verizon chocolate he 's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but i digress the screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator the film has some kind of electrostatic polymer there 's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed i would recommend	7
1	i was expecting just to save the touch screen from scratches but these screens make the touch screen also feel better there was no loss of brightness with the screen placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough its a pack of 15 screens have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all i 'll need to replace it	7
1	this product is great it fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases	7
1	i have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product it works and looks great i only wish they could make a pda phone that was n't as big as a boat	7
1	the headset works fine people who i talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but i doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset	7
0	the only support i received was to send me to a competitor 's homepage and try to download their software	7
1	when i lost my stylus i had a difficult time finding a replacement the others i tried were n't the same these are	7
0	these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped the software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time	7
1	not much to say about a battery i installed it it works fine	7
0	does not work with verizon v3c when i plug the phone in it says unauthorized charger and refuses to charge at all it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars if i could i would give it zero stars i suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing maybe it works in china but not in north america	7
1	these replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus	7
1	i recommend this phone to anybody i absolutely love it i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far the music player is great and i swear the camera looks alot better than 1 3 mega pixel the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it if you buy this phone it will last you a long time but yeah so far no problems whatsoever i love it	7
1	i recently bought a nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones however the nokia ca 53 cable was around 50 dollars this was a great alternative so far everything that i have used it for is working flawlessly i would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the ca 53	7
1	works fine difficult to connect but connects securely comes with an unlabeled cd \( could n't tell one side from the other \) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones are n't labeled in any helpful way i was impressed it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy	7
0	i bought this item to protect my new motorola l6 first of all it 's a cheap piece of plastic would break if dropped second and more important my phone doesn't work with it on ! the plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone beware don't buy	7
1	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
1	when i first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as i opened the package and put my phone in it i could tell it was a perfect fit i really like the clear window which i did not have on my previous case now i can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time	7
0	this worked for only a couple days although the belt pocket clip held my treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way after a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time after a couple more days it was useless save your money on this one	7
1	i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed	7
1	ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it it is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone	7
0	poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy buy something else that actually works	7
1	i think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800 00 dollars well i called nokiausa direct and regular retail from them is 499 00all day as many as you want so it should be considerably less on amazon you would think \? i guess not !	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
1	be careful amazon identifies this phone as being gsm 850mhz it is not read the 'vital statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850mhz check the sony web page \( and other people who sell this phone \) and you will see that it does not work on 850mhz i do n't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when i discovered this discrepancy i gave it 4 stars because of the cool magic mirror case i have no idea if this phone is really good or not	7
0	the adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500 the sound only came out of one ear when plugged in	7
1	saves time and up downloading pics tunes to from my phone	7
0	i got the phone because it was small but i did n't know i 'd be sacrificing so much the speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day i get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and i can see thru to the casing all in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but it 's not really the best for what you 'll want to do with your cell phone	7
0	i have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price i thought my fulfilled contract \( i am on month to month now \) meant i could qualify for a new account and keep my number no such luck after wasting a few hours dealing with cingular and then someone in india on behalf of wirefly i had to return it it is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer ! i will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though i would prefer the 750	7
1	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
1	i just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it it is my favorite phone i have had to date some people ask me what can that thing do \? and i respond to that what cant it do this phone can do anything you really want the features are nicely made to be used especially since it has a beautiful 2 2 in touchscreen the display is incredible i can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do the last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance	7
1	great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user strong and looks good it even comes with a clear plastic screen saver i am very happy with this product	7
0	i 've had two of these both sounded and worked well for a few months then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second when this happens you 're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery while it 's perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste \( battery contains lithium i bet \) skip by this one if you 're smart i 've been had twice	7
0	save your money the eargels split in two days i used regular ear buds on the large size they did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality if you want the small and med i 'll send them to you for shipping i have no use for them	7
1	my only complaint and consequently the 4 star rating is that sometimes i do n't hear the blackberry or feel the vibration apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the oem plastic holster	7
1	the battery works great and lasts a long time i 'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes	7
0	net10 cell phones are great but do n't buy this card net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards i put the pin in my phone and did not receive the minutes i called technical support and received 1000 minutes i was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that i will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days don't buy this card	7
1	i purchased this headset \( \) and the key features i like are as follows 1 aaa battery no charging ! 2 easy to pair with my phone \( motorola slvr l7 european version \) 3 no static on both ends 4 have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated 5 price affordable but acts like an expensive headset 6 volume is good 7 fits well does not feel lose 8 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced i am very happy with it i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset	7
1	great case protects my sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push decent sansa products are hard to find thank you speck	7
1	got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything ! awesome deal for 3 bucks	7
1	excellent price for the charger original motorola equipment shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item shipping was very fast i definetly will continue to do business with amazon and a1 accessories very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience	7
1	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
0	i have n't tried the hands free device and probably wo n't bother but the case is cheap looking and the charger did n't work at all as they say you get what you pay for ! i'm going to an actual store and get a real motorola accessory kit do n't bother with this one	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	this battery arrived fast fits and works well i highly recommend this seller	7
1	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
1	but it does have some faults i have had it for some time now i got it for my 11th birthday i have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon faults very short battery life i have to charge it almost every day ! camera the picture you take ca n't move or it comes out all messed up good parts big screen easy to read ! recording videos even though you get 15 seconds i still use that to make funny videos with my friends it 's style i love the color and style ! my friends are all jealous overall i think it 's a great phone	7
1	this is the prettiest one i think ! there are other pinks but they are tacky this mauve is the perfect pink for my taste do n't ever discontinue this item these are great	7
1	iam very pleased with this item i purchased it for my son	7
1	the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes i 've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone pda features i bought a 4gb mini sd card \( samsung memory \) from ebay for 39 99 combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for 110 they 're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2 5mm jack	7
1	besides all the functions described above the cable has one more function it can be used as a charger too ! this is really cool the company 's service is great for every order i put i received the products within 3 4 days at the price of ground shipping fees	7
1	the cover design is well made based on the requirements the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case	7
1	this is a wonderful cover for your blackberry very sturdy and easy to use love it !	7
1	i have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble this makes its way through all that problems well on the other hand it does have a catch1 finger print magnet2 the price that price for one ! ! ! and yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable	7
1	some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to work however i found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone after installing the drivers just search the web for a program called bitpim it 's not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done	7
1	i 've owned and discarded numerous chargers this one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use it looks pretty fragile but so far it 's held up to pretty heavy use many of the other chargers i 've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one	7
1	i agree with previous reviewers \( gely zencity \) regarding this cable the price was right set up was easy and \( with the bitpim program \) you can communicate with your lg vx8300 efficiently i loaded my whole outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones do n't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from verizon 's sites \( vcast and such \) just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music tones that you already own	7
0	i owned two of these earbooms the fit was comfortable and the sound very good however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	7
1	got this to protect my motorola l6 phone it fits the phone like a glove i also love that it protects the phone screen the only complaint is that the case open easily if it 's dropped or handled in a rough way clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that my toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it the case still does not have a chip or crack on it	7
1	i just picked up one of these for my motorola cell phone it has more than enough volume it comes with both a right and left ear adapter fits pretty good and i have medium sized ears its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it it is very comfortable though if you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset	7
1	only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil	7
0	we 've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year very inconsistent service when calling our son i would get a message that his number was blacklisted after calling cingular several times we demanded new phones not lg1500 we were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing so we 're getting a different brand if a phone does n't work the company needs to get rid of them !	7
1	i highly recommend this bundle for the price for less than the cost of an offical verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a usb cable with driver cd everything works just fine the instructions for the usb cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use windows media player to move music over to your phone using the sync feature and you can use a free program such as bitpim to do other file transfers between your pc and phone	7
1	while i thankfully have n't had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely the only thing i would change is to give it a fixed belt clip	7
1	as usual motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all it 's more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal	7
0	this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you do n't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo	7
1	i just got the cable and the software for my motorall v600 and it 's very easy to use i just did a backup of all my contacts pics and music	7
1	i needed a razr car charger and the crystal clear hard shell case was included with the purchase i did not think i would even use it but i love it ! it is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my razr phone !	7
0	a useless piece of junk worked for 3 minutes then broke have since bought a motorola brand one for three times what i paid for this piece of junk do not be attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for \( or what you dont pay for in this case \)	7
1	great product exactly as advertised thinking about buying a couple more in different color	7
1	excellent sound quality noise cancellation really works the button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call very nice works much better and more reliably than any bluetooth set i 've tried and i 've tried almost all of them	7
1	i have a baby pink razr and this skin looks so good over it also it really adds grip so it 's not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr i would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr they are awesome	7
1	i really like the javoskin for my treo it 's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable the material is soft to the touch but strong on protection i do n't like the lanyard they send with the product it 's about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces i prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist	7
1	i switched to this phone from verizon e815 some of the details i find different pros sleek designgood battery lifecompact2mp cameracons choppy voice sometimes hard to listenscreen and buttons little smallworks for me as i do n't use the phone for internet email or use lot other features	7
1	the battery was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly will do business again the battery make 's the phone last 2 days even with continued use	7
1	i'm a previous owner of body glove cel phone cases \( a moto v810 \) i purchased this item from amazon a few days ago for my 6255 my cel fits perfectly the case protects every part of my cel \( buttons screens jacks \) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice my next phone will have its body glove case too	7
0	for a good price of approximate 4 50 \( as i recall \) plus shipping i ordered the bargaincell brand new ikross retractable car cigarette lighter adapter it did not work i suppose i could have packaged it up and sent it back \( at a cost to me \) and probably received a replacement but for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time i 've resorted to using a standard car recharger	7
0	the other reviewer could n't run much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc i wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so i thought great i ca n't get any power through mine at all the little light goes on but the radar detector does n't go and the cell phone charger does n't go i 'll probably take it apart andd see if i can rewire it it is n't worth shipping back i really ca n't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer	7
1	i was concerned with the 1 star review so i ordered from desirepro \( who had a higher rating \) instead of eforcity i received my order promptly and it works well	7
1	though still not quite enough battery for the juice sucking q it is worlds better than the included battery i would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies	7
0	i ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival also notice that this is not a samsung oem part if you call to ask for tech support from samsung they will tell you they ca n't help you the only positive thing i have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless	7
1	not looking to spend the cash for bluetooth but need something to work \? this is it with the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone very happy with the purchase	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7
1	the battery was everything needed no surprises it fit the phone and charged fine	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this charger works perfectly with my samsung blackjack it is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone	7
0	i guess you get what you pay for so i was n't totally surprised that the battery did n't work what was worse is that when i sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a part of what i paid for it do n't do business with these guys and do n't buy this battery	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
0	i saw the other review that said it did n't work for v173 but i bought this anyway for my v170 it also does n't work for v170 why amazon is advertising and selling this product as a motorola v170 charger is beyond me i guess sometimes the products are mislabeled	7
1	this is my first blackberry phone and i must say it 's an awesome device ! my husband has a blackberry through his work so i got one too how we can pin each other keep in touch via email etc while he is away the pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc i highly recommend it	7
1	i like this case very much for my blackberry it definitely improves the grip on the blackberry especially when i'm using it as a phone it also serves as an excellent protector when i throw it in my purse my two problems are that i wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the speck ipod protective cases \( come on guys ! women use these items too ! \) also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the blackberry in the week that i 've had this case other than those two things this is a great not bulky case	7
1	you might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by oem products gives one much peace of mind i am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if i know what i am getting is not just a counterfeit i think i got my money 's worth	7
0	i have had to exchange my pink verizon motorola razr 3 times ! ! ! ! ! ! luckily i purchased the insurance i'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr \( this last phone only lasted a few weeks ! \) this time i am asking for different phone the phone works fine then all of sudden one day 1 2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you ca n't get to anything no phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing ! ! ! ! it is extremely frustrating what is the point of a cute phone that does n't work	7
0	advantages 1 \) superior protection i have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case 2 \) all buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to in cases disadvantages 1 \) signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case ! 2 \) belt clip useless since the case can easily open spilling out the phone when on one 's belt 3 \) side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons \( above start and ok buttons \) summary usable only for protection during transportation and does this well phone should be removed from case during usage	7
1	driver install was easy and bitpim access works just fine the cable i received also charges the phone \( vx8300 from verizon \)	7
1	how come phone accessories do n't qualify for prime shipping \? how are they different from other electronics	7
0	i have had this phone for about six months i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it 's hard to do anything the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it 's closed it 's almost impossible to hear i almost never hear it ring i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on ! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon	7
1	holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case ! clips to belt and holds tight since the phone is horizontal and not vertical i do n't have trouble catching it on things i 've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car the phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap this case works great and eliminates that problem ! the perfect solution	7
1	was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what i expected for the price i really thought it was a little cheap looking in person as it was a gift i was somewhat disappointed in the quality however the person i gave it to was pleased	7
0	well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it	7
0	i bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer the description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does not ! ! the software needed to download the pictures is not correct when we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem apparently i am not the only person to have this problem with the product again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are not accurate it does not work	7
1	the pack is quite as described any one of the three itemsmight justify the small expense	7
0	i ordered this phone on 3 28 07 it shipped via fedex on 3 29 07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3 2 07 the package sat on the fedex truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for this was after i 'd already called fedex to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving fedex 's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded for the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local cingular store	7
1	this item came with the other item i ordered at the same time it 's quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as i would have liked	7
1	i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands ! ! anyone who are crazy over that color !	7
0	this product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	7
0	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
1	i am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinion	7
1	this is a great basic cell phone i bought one and received another as a gift unfortunately i opened both so now i have \( 2 \) if anyone needs one for twenty five plus shipping that has not been registered with net10 \( still has bonus 300 minutes and no number \) is new and has all original accessories \( open package \) or for ten extra you can get an oem car charger leather case and earphone \( all unused \) please email movieshop \( at \) hotmail \( dot \) com	7
1	car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter the design is basic with no hidden features you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device otherwise a perfect gift !	7
0	i bought these adaptors to use regular head phones \( 3mm \) with my cell phone mp 3 \( lg cu500 \) player once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound you only can hear the music through one ear whoever started the whole 2 5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail it makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone i have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level they all have some type of flaw the volume wo n't get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
0	you will still need to buy the ac cord for this unit this is not a charger it 's essentially a 30 00 piece of plastic that holds the q upright	7
0	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
0	bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline should n't a cell phone battery last longer than a month \? \? they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i 'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same	7
1	i have a motorola v220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month the cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet it 's fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough a small red led lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether you 're charging your phone or not i debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price	7
1	i 've had it for about 2 months and i am still happy with it it has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but i like it	7
1	sony ericsson w710i is a very nice cell phone 850 900 1800 1900 gsm pedometer bluetooth gprs ir 2mpix camera mp3 player \( 512 mb included \) and so on this baby is loaded	7
1	i purchased the pink razr with cingular service and could n't be happier i have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all i am very happy with it t mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why i chose cingular	7
0	this case actually scratches and destroys your pearl the inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone the phone does n't provide any protection on top i really regret buying this my phone is all scratched get a soft case that stays on permanently pass this one up	7
1	i love this phone i can do so much with it it is light weight and fun to carry i love the button flip feature great phone ! !	7
0	this deal was too good to be true of course i was n't expecting any name brand stuff here but at least i expected them to all work i do n't know if i got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used the case i did n't need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed the power adapter seems to work fine so basically i spent 9 99 and am only using the power adapter i guess that 's a good enough deal i think i 'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud headset though	7
1	this is the best phone i have ever had reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera and best of all very very user friendly	7
1	i had been using this product for 2 weeks now no problems discomfort quality stuff	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in cellphone stores excellent product for the price i bought two one for home and one for work	7
0	i was extremly disappointed when i received this it did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can i had one of the first razor phones and it did not fit when i got th belt clip i went to cingular to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip that did n't fit either i would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar with shipping cost it costs about 6 00	7
1	this product needs a better custom fit it slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big	7
1	i will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone i have ever owned its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear	7
1	this is a very nice case it fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it i found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit a great case that i would highly recommend	7
0	first time when i plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that charging error remove immediately since then i am not using this	7
1	the title says it all fits great great price ! real leather and fits like a glove	7
0	the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me it 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end i'm not happy with these	7
1	i will only use krusell products as they are better than best customer service is as good as the product there is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price the rating should be a 10	7
1	if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing ! ! ! do n't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that \? \? ! ! ! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it ! ! ! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn t have a chord jeez !	7
0	i love the way the phone looks and feels but that 's about it from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i 've ever owned i 've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise	7
0	this device is unusable with a treo 600 every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card do n't waste your money	7
1	after about a year the ear support on this bluetooth headset broke bad news good news it has a 2 year warranty and logitech is replacing it with a mobile traveller model since the mobile freedom is no longer made contact logitech tech support audio by phone \( ca n't be done over the web \) it 's nice to see a company stand behind their products way to go logitech	7
1	this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky come with belt clip if u need i	7
0	this product stopped working after about a week or two lesson learned buy oem products instead of cheap knock off	7
0	i dropped my treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case	7
1	as advertised on time i 've used for two months and it works great i 'd buy from this outfit again	7
0	i purchased this to replace a lost holster the first time i tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams	7
1	this phone is great ! ! ! i love this phone i have had no problems with this phone at all the camera is pretty good and it 's small and cute in size and it has good reception i would definitely reccomend this phone ! !	7
0	i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it wrong item	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
0	it looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily the shipping was fast and the price was right	7
1	i just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice it feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special i like the blue led light instead of the typical red dot also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging the ic chip is important so that you do n't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it 's life i would buy again great price for a quality charger	7
1	very nice but i do n't like the belt clip if i remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be	7
1	it 's just as advertised the cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord that 's just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for charging syncing the 8125 use it every day	7
1	it fits great but does n't cover the corners of the phone kinda the point of a case the seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful the bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you 're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket	7
1	this item cost 1 penny \( of course the shipping was 4 84 \) but i thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores i 've had it for two weeks and it has n't broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally ca n't go wrong with the price order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters	7
0	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
1	this is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen i do n't foresee it peeling ever it has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on i 've washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place it is extremely sensitive to bending and if you bend it it will never go back so be extra careful	7
1	use it every day it 's a nice connector that does just what it says it does as with all treo palm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection wiggling the connector where it meets the treo is usually enough for it to work for me	7
0	the phone may be fine but i will never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked perhaps it was the phones fault i never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account overall their customer service is awful days of waiting and receiving no information i had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right i spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed now i have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service i plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone its garbage i went with the t mobile sidekick and already am way happier	7
1	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
0	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
1	i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i ca n't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and do n't fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them \( i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so do n't say you ca n't use all of the sizes guys	7
0	service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates dont get it ! you will end up paying the same if you have a plan	7
0	i agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months now not only does it not charge my phone but if i plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge ! it 's also always falling out of the lighter plug i do n't have that problem with any of my other chargers and i carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets	7
1	i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr v3m it fits very well and looks very nice	7
0	i bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk they worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit	7
0	este producto no es lo que anuncian 100 metros de alcance y solo palabras no sirve no la debuelvo porque me sale mas caro el envio de lo que cuesta esta porqueri	7
1	i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i was n't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them	8
0	this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it 's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list \( which means that it is the highest mass ingredient \) is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed	8
1	none of that super sugared candied dried fruit or flat tasting candy e g chocolate chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack do n't get me wrong i love chocolate the darker the better but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing if i want candy i 'll buy the good stuff thanks amazon my local market no longer carries it	8
1	the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered great deal and great service	8
0	i was trying these as a change of pace from the turkey jerky i normally eat they taste ok \( nothing special \) but several of the medallions \( in at least 3 bags so far \) had 'crunchy' bits in them i suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments not pleasant to eat i may have just gotten a bad batch \( other than the crunchy bits i 'd give these a 4 star rating \)	8
1	i 've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index this product is the best and it tastes wonderful my kids do n't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes highly recommend	8
1	other than the republic of tea the people 's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract \( protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation \) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one 's daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day !	8
1	nutritious soft delicious organic zero trans fats whole grain hempfor fiber omega 3 's and some protein we just love em ! !	8
1	i bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth i buy natural snacks for my kids \( freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar \) but i find them bland so i ordered these and i love this flavor in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it was n't too spicy for her they use black pepper which is flavorful but i would n't call it spicy	8

0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
1	it 's a great new \( at least for me \) crystal light flavor my husband loves it	8

1	i 've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and have n't made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it 's marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki \( perfect \) a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism	8
1	this is a great tasting coffee i highly recommend it as it is shade grown and fair trade certified	8
1	this product is the best no aftertaste it 's organic and has a low glycemic value i use it in beverages it 's lighter than honey in this bottle it squirts out easily i seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness this is for the light easy storage and does not change consistency over time the regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness	8
0	pro no trans fat con no flavor basically tastes like cardboard my children wo n't eat it	8
1	timothys coffee is my favorite ! and the 2 packs boxes is a very good value	8
1	i have used this cake mix many many times the first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday she said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer i have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though i am the only gluten free person i add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream yummy	8

1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	8

0	terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top the flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and i wondered what i was eating ! alone they were nearly tasteless and i 'll never purchase again yuck	8
1	these are a perfect size for work and great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack my kids really like them and while they are n't low calorie or really low fat it is n't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat the 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	8

0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8

1	this is mine and my husbands favorite tea it has such a smooth satisfying taste we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best we ca n't always find it so when i found it on amazon i was elated being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) was just what we were looking for and we will continue to buy it here thanks amazon	8

1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8

1	this is my favorite of essn 's juices it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails also a huge hit with kids ca n't beat 100 juice worth every penny	8
0	first of all the tea chest is disappointing to say the least the chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic the tea its self is alright sadly nothing special this item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after i opened it a few dozen times needles to say this product way disappointing all around	8

1	this tastes and looks like the real thing \( wheat semolina \) my kids ca n't tell the difference i'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now	8
1	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
1	i love this cereal i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time i also snack on it dry it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price do n't worry about buying too many with the six pack i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor	8
1	i tried a two lb pack and then ordered this for a reorder tart cherries great for oatmeal and sauses as well as snack	8
1	this is a terrific espresso i got hooked on lavazza in italy and have n't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it 's throne this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i 'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor would highly recommend !	8
1	this is a deliciously smooth tasting coffee rich flavor and no acid stomach ! i 've had a hard time getting it locally and amazon has saved me	8

1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	i am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful very warming and spicy	8
0	i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee most of the time i would just give up again the other brand of coffee i use never does this not getting this coffee anymore i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all donna marylan	8
1	first i 'd like to say that many of nana 's cookies are most delicious and i 've tried most of the flavors my favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip as one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie for those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions vegan sugar substitutes etc these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we 've been led to believe we want thanks nana 's for the natural foodie options	8
1	this product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep before this i was taking harsh medicines like tylenol pm 's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before i went to bed ! not with the tea ! let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you	8
0	this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti	8
1	the only way i drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories !	8
1	illy rules my favorite espresso roast great price excellent	8
1	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
1	i brought a few bags to a work day in may and people are still asking me about them because you ca n't buy them in stores around here they 're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips but instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy	8
0	these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected	8
1	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
0	i have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all however this sweet corn is all but sweet i would say it should be called salty corn i think they would have a great product if they did away with the salt also or change the name to salty corn cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company i dont think they would give the other products a try from there line myfavorite is cherry berry and orchard blend	8
1	while i like all of the kashi products i 've tried this one has to be my favorite ! with a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get \? great taste with seven grains and sesame ! perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box	8
1	he did not know if he would but he loves them great for a quick snack or a snack to go please do n't quit selling these glad we bought them and will buy more	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son \( 6 \) does not like them	8
1	i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands	8
0	wish i would have paid attention to this one the the previous review the cost for what you get is outrageous only reason i gave it one star is because there was no place to give is zero starts do n't waste your money like i did ! ! ! find a more economical product \( plenty more choices on amazon btw \)	8
1	the product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the optimum power which has blueberries in it it is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite	8
1	these are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor they are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew this is the best licorice i have ever had bar none ! the bag is huge ! haribo really knows how to make candy	8
1	my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves we use it to make raw truffles \( sooo good \) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc we had no problems with shipments leaking so far	8
1	this is a very tasty creamy hot cereal if you 're gluten sensitive give this a try after i switched to a gluten free diet i was missing oatmeal something awful i thought i would give this a try as an alternative and was glad i did ! with some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal	8
1	i 've purchased many of these products i put this in my top three good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick	8
1	someone told me to look on amazon to locate this product it 's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees' the taste is out of this world and so easy to make i inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner thank you for having this product on amazon	8
1	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	8
1	fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant almost overwhelming when you open the package the finished product is mellow and delicious not too rich i'm going to try it in the crock pot one of these days glad i tried it	8
1	i find this coffee to be very rich in flavor yest strong enough for my taste	8
1	i love these cookies ! the only complaint i had is that i ordered a case \( 12 boxes \) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day i received the shipment yikes i still have over half the case left and i 've been eating them daily \( and giving them away \) ! i probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone however if you 're looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option	8
1	i have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money although this is n't a full size slim jim but rather a shorter one it 's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up slim jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you wo n't go wrong with the 100 count box	8
1	these are the best banana chips i 've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination ! i would highly recommend this product	8
1	great product what else can i say \? while i lived in the caribbean i ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there	8
1	these are very good biscotti ! i've ordered 4 boxes of 12 in the past few months they were nice to give as gifts they were good to bring to someones house for dessert the chocolate decadence and the ones with the toffee bits and almonds are very good the only negative is the shipping and handling cost if i did not get the free shipping and handling i would not have ordered them they're good but not good enough to spend an extra 20 to deliver	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	i ordered this mocha java because the green mountain brand was not available there is no comparison i am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe	8
0	granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco 's granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that 's better	8
1	this is the best crumb topping i have ever made i got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you just add a few things and done what a pleasure	8
0	maybe i'm daft but i ca n't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine i 've tried tamping them which does n't work well and i 've tried just placing them in the filter in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso as with other european products \( think ikea \) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings perhaps i'm just doing something wrong i like the concept of pods but i 'll stick to beans instead	8
1	i use k cups all the time at work at home etc there are a handful of good k cup brands out there this is one of the best both decaf and regular timothy 's columbian are smooth and rich in flavor add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee ! ! you wo n't be disappointed believe it or not the home brewing k cup machine \( keurig \) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial k cup machine \( also keurig \) because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it fyi	8
1	this mix is a blessing for those w food allergies ! even if we did n't have any food allergies i 'd buy this mix i do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer \( 10m \) if using a glass dish	8
1	i'm french and i love these galettes they are the typical kind of cookies you can find in brittany \( bretagne \) with a light salted butter taste i like the tin too you can keep it to store whatever you like ! make a great gift to french cookies lovers	8
0	i thought they had a stale texture and they did n't have enough salt ener g does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these are n't it hope this helps all the gluten free people like me	8
0	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	8
0	these pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well it could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong	8
1	it just is ! not much else to say about this	8
1	outstanding full flavored earl grey tea better than the other non branded earl grey teas	8
1	just what it says all white meat individually sized portable and easy to prepare perfect alternative for tuna sala	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
0	this mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a lot of crumbs inside the packets	8
1	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	8
1	these pods are excellent ! same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price	8
1	best snack i 've found in years i keep these in my desk at work for a mid afternoon appetite curb highly recommended by all my family and friends	8
1	i'm not exactly sure how good these are for you \? \? \? but i do know they taste great ! ! i bought these because i never have time for breakfast in the morning and i'm also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent !	8
0	most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed they put no expiration date on the bags so i do n't even know if i was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way on top of this they were too spicy my dog seemed to enjoy it though the ahi tuna on the other hand was great	8
1	these cookies are great my kids love them i saved a bundle by ordering the case beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06 i did n't have any problems with the classic the expiration date was nov or dec i ca n't remember off hand	8
1	i recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets tasty ! we also like the marinara so versatile flavorful and convenient	8
0	these are fine if they were n't supposed to have blueberries there are essentially none most pouches of the 24 do n't even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it 's a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that 's very rare avoid this variety	8
0	i beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan it baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture and was completely inedible when i very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund the customer service person said they could not give me a refund and said thank you for your understanding huh \? \? i 'll never purchase any more of their products	8
0	this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it does n't release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth i had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and i'm not sure what to do with them i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up ! what a waste of money go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned this product is a joke	8
1	this product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce it can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables the taste is pleasing	8
1	love this stuff great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well no after taste at all	8
1	nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste packaged as they are \( 2 resealable packages of 20oz each \) it 's a very economical buy too just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first our kids like these better than raisins	8
1	its a shame they quit carrying it i would have reordered twice by now	8
1	we 1st found this coffee at a local store the local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that amazon sold it it has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink very easy	8
0	i ordered the chocolate mint variety amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly however i ordered the cookies in early november and they arrived with a best when used by date of december 4 2006 they will expire less than a month after they arrived ! i'm not sure if this is amazon 's fault or not the cookies are shipped in the manufacturer 's back to nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on amazon com	8
1	they went over well in our house the sugar content is semi low and the peanut butter has good protein	8

1	i'm a vegetarian and although my husband is n't he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you 're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you 've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets amazon sells it for 2 66 a box substantial savings	8
1	looks like it got squashed a little and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new but i checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there i tried one and its great this is a good buy for what you get i just got a damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased overhaull 4 stars out of 5 i will buy here again fast delivery thank	8

1	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
1	great way to pass the day at work fresh and tasty	8

1	i 've tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious ! this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long ! it is moderately spicy but if you do n't mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up i could practically live off of this stuff ! thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating	8

0	the sell by date on a package was less than a month so that they would not go bad i felt like i needed to personally eat more than i would have i have a retail store and i need a bit more time on new products this was a costly mistake also the wholesale price from the business itself was the same as amazon 's price except amazon gave free shipping and a discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! as a retailer i would think that i would be able to get a better deal from betty lou 's or get a reasonable sell by date very tasty and addicting	8

1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	quickly became my favorite when it first came out tastes great and the milk does n't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals i also use it on ice cream to add crunch i would give it 5 stars but even though it think it 's great it is overpriced price here is about the same as out local safeway	8
0	we have been buying the melita buzzworthy dark roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied recently they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines i also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling at the time melita made these changes i believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good accordingly i rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars we are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee	8

0	i thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants i was wrong they taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly also still had quite a bit of sodium	8
1	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
1	i bake 3 4 times per week and honestly can say that this product is great i tried it for the first time to make bread i almost cried my bread was the best i ever made i will buy it again for sure	8

1	i do n't normally review items but i had to write something on this because all of these it 's too salty comments are driving me crazy these are hardly salty at all there is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food my bag says its only 8 of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving i'm a man so i personally think these could use more salt	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	there is no doubt that this tea does it 's job but the smell of it is awful i normally do n't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but i have such an aversion to the smell of this tea it has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad the box says that it contains delicious sasparilla i do n't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all if you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it	8
0	my wife and two year old like this cereal however i find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat i prefer the purely o 's just wish they came in an eco pack	8

0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not health	8
1	ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you 're on a diet \? that was a problem for me at least i 've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight well just when i 'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr kracker spelt muesli crackers ! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea ! highly recommended	8
1	i will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo	8
1	bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast 's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat	8
0	i agree with the person who said it 's hard to chew and here is why disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair \? it is \( allegedly \) all made of cow hair gross ! that is the beef part i guess trans fat \( partially hydrogenated veg oil \) and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good \? no thanks glad i did not buy 100 ! my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog 's p peewww ! ! !	8
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea the bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary the color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery i carry the bagged variety everywhere i go	8
1	this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal	8
1	these 6 oz packs of organic california prunes have more flavor than the non organic brands they are also drier and firmer which i was n't sure i liked at first i quickly grew used to it and now i prefer them this way they are sweet and chewy the freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have you ca n't go wrong at this price for 12 bags this is one brand you can trust	8
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	8
1	nice clean meyer lemon flavor these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon chefs love using these lemons in recipes this flavor also makes a great lemon drop	8
1	these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty do n't expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes they are just plain very good though and great in recipes	8
1	great flavor light and fluffy and good texture only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches unlike other gluten free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	i first had these in alaska and when i returned my taste buds could n't stop thinking about them ! they are a great alternative to fast foods	8
1	i bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away the kids loved the choices the only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old on average they ate two a day	8
0	it 's not terrible but it 's not very good for the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better i sent 8 of the 9 packets back	8

1	i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it 's great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it 's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up	8
1	i love these snacks especially the valdosta blend the others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the valdosta it 's a great snack or salad topper delicious and good for you	8
1	these are as close to the real thing as it gets i added chocolate chips to half of the batter and crasins \( dried cranberries \) to the other half i have had celiacs for almost 2 years now and these are the best gluten free product i have eaten ! i had to hide them from the rest of my family b c they liked them as well !	8
1	i discovered these a few months ago and now i eat them for breakfast everyday the nutrition info is good and so is the taste	8
1	we recently ordered a case of this cereal from amazon and are down to our last box now ! my husband and daughter have celiac and i do n't but i eat more of it than they do it 's really that good	8
1	i have never ordered anything such as this online i was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take i will consider ordering again once i have used these up the walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when i have purchased them at the grocery store	8
0	the newly re packaged twinings earl grey tea \( has the word classics on the package \) is much much weaker than the previous twinings earl grey tea if you used and like to the old teas then you wo n't like the new version i wonder if they have weakened the britsh version of twinings earl grey tea	8
1	pros very tastynatural \( no preservatives \) cons difficult to che	8
1	i tried this snack tonight and it was all i could do not to eat the whole bag well the night is young so i probably will i love the flavors and the spiciness of it	8
1	i drink this stuff religiously it tastes great with very little bitterness coming through even when over steeped the yogi quotes are fun too	8
1	i tried betty lou 's spirulina ginseng balls because i read the nutritioninformation and you get 40 of your daily requirement for vitamin a inone serving at this point in my quest to eat healthier i 've read lotsand lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack israre finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare if you 're looking for a yummy sugery snack thisis not for you ! if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out	8
1	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
0	i was going to buy these until i saw that they contained trans fats \( partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in cocoa crispies fruit loops and corn pops \) who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats \?	8
1	hardley any bad ones in the whole bag i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more	8
1	these cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box they taste like real butter and fresh ingredients and they just about melt in your mouth i 'll be buying these again	8
0	really dry and just not as good as could be a disappointment after using this companys other products	8
1	these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks breakfast foods they 're nice and sweet wo n't fall apart on you like granola bars yet do n't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it 's the perfect consistancy a great way to get some portable protien if you do n't want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you	8
0	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
1	this is my favorite side dish it is so versatile and so very easy to make it tastes great with any and every kind of sausage i 've ever tried i love to make it when i whip up a batch of hot wings	8
1	i have ordered these twice now they taste so good ! i also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked	8
0	sadly this is pretty crummy tea for decent orange pekoe i remain sold on typhoo	8
0	the title is wrong this item contains twelve 5 grams \( 0 0175 ounce \) packets not twelve 5 ounce packets	8
1	i love the taste of this cereal if you like the puffed wheat sold in grocery stores for decades you too may find you love the fresh vibrant taste of these over sized grains of puffed delight best served in very cold whole organic milk i think i will go eat some now	8
0	this is a terrible tasting bar i have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst i 've ever tasted it leaves an after taste	8
1	i love andy capp steak fries but be warned about long shipping times it has been two weeks since my order and i have n't received the product i do n't know if fedex style shipping would have helped	8
0	it is not the wonderful twinings earl grey you have come to know and love they have pulled a new coke blunder and now the best earl grey tea ever is available no more ! this tea is weak and tasteless i hate stupidity especially from corporate marketers	8
1	these snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery the taste resembles that of cottage cheese a little under salted for my taste but still great watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape o mix you probably do not want to bite into those	8
0	this is a strong blend when i want a cup of decaf i usually want a milder blend and after a cup or two of this blend i still seem to get jittery i question whether or not it is truly decaffeinated	8
1	excellent taste and texture the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture if you really like your crunch i 'd go for the all apple product my only disappointment is that you 're not getting a lot for your money i love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon so i 'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one	8
1	this stuff is delicious ! i 've been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself \( i feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff \) and it seems to be a pretty good choice it does n't take a lot to satisfy and it 's not really that bad for you \( sugar sure but not as much as some other treats \)	8
0	i was very disappointed in this product i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out 20 i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not	8
1	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	so these are basically ritz bits but with three differences 1 the crackers are better they taste more buttery and flavorful 2 the cheese is better it actually tastes like something that 's met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand 3 they 're all organic 'n' stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to big food if you 're packing lunches for kids \( or snacks for yourself \) these are great	8
1	this is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea at more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at \( no offense to organic stores but a 200 mark up is a little much \) this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up	8
1	this spread is way too good ! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone i like to eat it just straight out of the jar the spread is a perfect blend of flavors if you have a sweet tooth and do n't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us you have to order it at least once though !	8
0	i am sensitive to wheat gluten and i swear this product has gluten everytime i eat a bowl of it i get sick i bought tons of this cereal because it does taste good but now i do n't know what to do with it because i ca n't eat it i think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel somehow it is getting contaminated i wish i could send it back it is too bad because it is a good product it 's just not gluten free	8
0	then this is n't for you horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that i definately do n't care for not to say that you will not however if you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this is n't the one to try	8
1	i thought this was great but it just was n't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon so delicious though when i make it for people they ca n't believe it 's a mix	8
0	this snack \( lol \) tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month kinda looks like it too make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them very very dry	8
1	we bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea it 's a great bargain if you 're a tea drinker ! ! ! \)	8
0	i opened one packet \( which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office we all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible no one could continue eating it and i sent back 8 of the 9 packets not edible in our humble opinion sorry	8
1	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
1	we love the taste of illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter and the vacuum packed canister has a unique reusable design	8
1	these are sweet and crunchy and i love them my only concern is the price at a dollar a piece it 's a little more than my buget allows for a snack luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids	8
0	i tossed it out the texture is aweful and brittle only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible gross ! you get what you pay for	8
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	8
0	i too like the old smucker 's filled strawberry better \( aka fruit wheats \) this is ok but fruit filling is better they probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff	8
1	i am crazy about splenda i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael it saves money and calories asparteem \( nutrasweet \) gives me loose bowels splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	my two year old loves these and prefers them over goldfish i did a taste test with goldfish and the cheddar bunnies seem cheesier they seem less dry too	8
1	i received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola it 's a healthy snack that 's great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals	8
1	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
0	i 've purchased this locally and it was delicious so i was happy to see a deal offered by amazon unfortunately it never made it to my door ups reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to amazon this seems to match what many other reviewers said	8
1	i'm a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time clipper 's organic white tea with peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas the flavor is balanced well defined and makes for smooth sippin	8
1	if you are ever in the mood for summer sausage but do n't feel like cutting a piece off of a large log these are the ticket they have a great taste and are the perfect the snack ! highly recommended !	8
1	these are great and taste just like the real thing	8
0	i was very disappointed with this product i was sure i had tried cherries from this company but these had an off flavor were extremely sweet i gave away the 4 bags i bought	8
1	my son \( 3 \) and i love these he likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them he likes all the bunny graham varieties \( chocolate honey cinnamon \) they taste like the traditional graham crackers	8
1	this is a great cereal it is very similar to crispex only a whole lot better for you	8
1	i am a south beach diet follower and these crackers are a perfect choice to fit the guidelines of the diet and they are delicious ! they are quite expensive in stores so i'm very excited to see amazon offering them at such a great price	8
0	after searching high and low i found a site for 'nossa familia coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in brazil ! i guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods the site is www familyroast com and i highly recommend i	8
0	the main ingredient should be salt ! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can come on we usually sweat or need more salt in the summer but we tend to eat more soup in the winter my first impression was boy this is salty it would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper cambell 's cream of mushroom	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
0	i'm afraid i disagree with the other two reviews i thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like it does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly it 's an ok substitute but there are much better gluten free pastas out there although the glutino is cheaper i personally like orgran pasta 100 times better	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
0	as if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound this band sounds like a even more flaccid killswitch engage a hawthorne heights silverstein with downtuned guitars as if it wasnt an abomination already they even sing about vampires yes thats right vampires and you couldnt get any g yer	9
0	don`t waste your time and money on this compilation what a cheap shot to take the consumers money read the very fine print it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it shame on the distributor !	9
1	anais is one of the best cingers i have seen her since objetivo fama and she is just great do n't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating this cd is just great	9
0	if you are buying this because you love rob be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat if you are n't familiar with this incarnation let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame same guy different sensitivity i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there on this outing rob has met the enemy and it is himself he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it this cd is not an acquired taste it is a forced feeding	9
1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell 's the cadenzas are absolutely awesome i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician highly recommended	9
1	this is a fantastic album the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release \( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything \) should speak volumes i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it i am a pretty constant consumer of new music get this cd you wo n't regret it ! \( ps i 've never done an amazon review before but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me \) it is melodic catchy uplifting and cheeky in short a little piece of musical bliss	9
0	no strings attached is to my memory one of the worst albums ever made no one listens to the stupid boy bands anymore this piece of c p does not sell even a thousand copies today unless the previous reviewer is buying up all the million copies himself dont buy any album from n stync or the equally horrible justin timberlake get any beatles album instead	9
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now there 's great gentle interplay with jim hall and a total sound that is most enjoyable warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone	9
1	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks samples and guitars cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant	9
0	unfortunately ttd went off the deep end on this album consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album quot symphony or damn quot and the superb follow up quot vibrator quot if you loved the first album give this one a miss and get the two i just mentioned come on ttd hurry up and release a new album	9
0	i love to hear old standards and such but i like to hear people who put their own take on it i ca n't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe where are the male versions of nora jones \? tone down the cheese ! we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter \( not hams like buble dusk or boring singers like diana krall but what can i expect from the music industry \? rarely do the best song stylists get lots of attention so hmmm nevermind i guess it 's always been that way	9
1	link this cd of great melodies with the best of the browns \( 1954 1967 \) you 'll not regreat the quality such easy listening this group is simply the best i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book looking back to see a country music memoir it 's a well written \( and interesting \) cover of the the history of the browns	9
0	i wo n't dispute emmylou 's wonderful voice and mark knopfler 's superb guitar playing but this album just did n't cut it for me pretty lame about as likely as hank and phoebe snow	9
1	if you are a fan of the winter 's solstice series than you will enjoy this cd especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music	9
0	not exactly the vaults blowing open as stated in the promo these are mostly leftovers and one offs from the late 1990s when the group was on hiatus from serious recording that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows literary journals and graphic design firms whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected such as reprehensible rest awhile and certain people i could name but there are too few of these real songs and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long awaited b sides collection from their major label career	9
1	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker his band rocked ! after basie nobody swung like mcshann this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides anything by this man is worth listening to another great disc by the proper label who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price highly recommended	9
0	i agree complete with erik cobbett this is covenant 's most unnecessary and boring album ever there are a couple of nice parts on it but generally it 's a big disappointment	9

1	not speaking or understanding tibetian did n't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why it guides you like a sherpa gently leading you along the high trails powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air you are at once engulfed in the tibetian life you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants singing bowls and drums	9
0	if i ca n't buy the cd with all the songs that were played in the movie then i wo n't buy it i know one cd could cover the entire movie so why ca n't this be done \? does it concern copy rights and releases	9
0	this album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky wacky vivid personality of the first three galactic studio albums this is boring flat and generic is that stanton moore or a drum machine \? precede straight to garage a trois	9
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out	9
0	i found the music rather annoying it was not what i expected at all	9
0	though these are the songs that make the mills brothers famous they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals \( certainly they are considerably older \) these are ok but they lack the punch and familiarity \( to a fan like myself \) of the originals the title though not actually misleading leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs they are not i recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills brothers records	9
1	great anniversary present fav song i love the way you love me my husband loves to listen to it in the car	9
0	this air supply should 've been cut off a very long time ago whenever any of their songs comes on the radio i immediately shut it off bad ear candy is all they ever recorded mindless sappy garbage even bread 's music was more interesting than this	9
0	while some would call orange and acme studio albums suggesting that they lack originality but they have rythm i would call myself a big jsbx fan i play orange and acme constantly however i feel that this album is a little too much free form and free noise for the everyday listener i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx because it is a rather acquired taste	9
0	sinceramente no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas incluso renombrados artistas hacia este musico ungido de la leyenda grape amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados lastima piedad curiosidad no se me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson \( 13th \) en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio en fin son opiniones nada mas	9

0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song people will keep getting them for free in internet nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop pop commercial elevator music if you like that kind of music buy this cd otherwise buy hubert laws or dave valentin among others if you want to listen to good nestor music buy morning ride dance of the phoenix talk to me mi alma latina or the charanga album mis canciones primeras sorry nestor i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album	9
0	i own this set as does my roomate and we both hate it it highlights bands like 'red lorry yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to and uses great classic bands like bauhaus' worst song as the first track it is the hollow tin y embarrassingly hokey side of goth and i am ashamed to even have it in my house	9
1	how dare you compare oasis to phil collins phil collins sucks and oasis rules ! how come you do n't get the message \? you 're retarded	9

0	i got hooked on tiesto about 5 years ago heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album neverhteless it was n't but it was still tiesto though right \? well the hits on this cd are about 5 years old the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists stick with tiesto nyana 10130340345435 times better	9
1	tame 's music is all about the beat it 's what got me right from the start a grinding repetitious backbone to every song tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery tame gets rid of the verse hook standarda periodically ad libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing its an amazing album well worth purchasing	9
0	reba is not country anymore period ! ! this cd will prove that just listen to the first track which i think is horrible as a matter of fact i think the whole cd is horrible not deserving of reba 's talent	9

1	as one of the founding fathers of today 's heavy metal rock music iron butterfly has them power drive and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music this live album serves as a testament to that fact eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960 's through the mid 1980 's was primative at best \( by today 's standards \) this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart topping group of that era this is a must have for all iron butterfly fans	9
0	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit elefant 's lyrics i personally like interpol and the strokes i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs	9
1	percy grainger was a man of spectacular gifts he was one of the most original composer arrangers in the early part of this century he was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists this amazing cd documents grainger 's formidible gifts it cannot be over praised both the music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover 's attention do n't miss this one	9

0	after really enjoying the amici forever album i went shopping for another amici album and found this one there really is no comparison between the two i 've tried listening to it several times to see if i'm missing something but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe i was very disappointed	9
1	what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style he is careful not to over do it while still demonstrating skill and precision his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs i rarely make it to the end of this cd still for those who enjoyed quot a go go quot this one is quite similar so make sure to pick it up this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking but is a great casual listen \( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !	9
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible robben can rock and play slow blues every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford do n't miss chris cain this man is also a guitar genius	9
0	i never could understand why the beatles are so popular \? they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds i just dont like it because it sucks ! dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below the beatles only made one good album and that 's the one which contains ballad of john and yoko hey jude	9
1	immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin if you like cajun music this is for you if you like western swing this is for you if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant then this is for you ! classical \? jazz \? blues \? country rock \? then yeah you guessed it this is for you ! this is an absolutely fantastic album a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today 's greatest violinists pure genius	9
1	really enjoyed hearing all of them again there is some great talent on here i hope they all get their own opportunities ! i do think in some cases there are some better songs to show off these great singers voices	9

1	this album is a classic but its really short dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums	9
0	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here robin frequently disappears in the sound mix becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony that 's fine for a group concert like the bee gees but inexcusable for a solo effort his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act they should have kept this in the can it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin do n't do him the favor	9

0	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc was n't worth the effort i'm afraid velveeta on wonder bread dull collection of acid jazz duds not bad as background noise for your next dinner party but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act a pass for all but galactic completeists if such an animal exists	9

0	however despite what amazon reviewer kristy martin may believe ms croft does not need to get her freak on wow i guess hip hop can do no wrong in a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film here comes another fanboy girl of hip hop 's hopele ley misplaced garbage thank you kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along \( missy \) this song is soo done it 's practically taboo to listen too and outkast \? puhf ckingleez these clowns sold out a long long time ago	9
1	this is one of those rare cds that you 'll leave in your car cd player for months and not get tired of because it fits most moods feels like melissa etheridge meets cheryl crow with an old blues feel here and there and some nice heavy tori amos like piano and vocals here and there too	9

1	all i have to say is great album	9
0	i read several different on line reviews for this cd before i purchased it each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature strange i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her like my title line to this review states it 's the exact same music she has always sang just in a different package now the cd just collects dust what a shame	9
1	too bad this group supported by keith sweat did n't go any further i bought it for one song but the whole cd is great for listening lyrics contain songs about love and such and i like they way speak about it it gives you something to look forward to	9
0	generally harmless except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents the song is probably funny to ultra sophisticated cynical adults but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old i would n't bring this cd into your house	9
1	sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with guaraldi 's 1960 's hit quot cast your fate to the wind quot throw in a coupla classics like quot since i fell for you quot and quot moon river quot masterfully interpreted by vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding loving or waking up	9
0	lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort i'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from amazed syndrome amazed 's 1999 multi format mega success is spread all over this album their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville \? i'm already there comes off as very diane warren ish in its sappy lyrics their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay but these songs do n't work for them these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this	9

0	back 2 da basics 1 2 starsyo gotti has made some decent albums but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map has some good songs here and there but the rest are just ridiculous obnioxus and real pretentious this is not a good albumthumbs down	9
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	9
0	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	9
0	being a huge blondie fan i want to rate this one higher but sadly i cannot it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs it feel very negligant too i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco but their calypso number on this one is so awful they had lost it here check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat	9
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now	9

0	i like machine head a lot many people disliked the burning red and called them sell outs but i appreciated the effort to make something different then came supercharger i have listened to it a dozen times looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it it never came this is a bad cd by a great band	9

0	ana carolina is a good singer and seu jorge is a cult culture figure here in brazil but this cd is a mistake do not spend money on this	9

1	this has been my first cd of rod stewart and i am very proud to have this cd because worth every penny this cd has class congratulations to the men behind the duet with cher bewitched bothered bewildered is the best song duet with queen latifah as time goes by i was astonish she has a nice voice too ! ! all songs are relaxings actually i listen this cd before to go bed	9
1	i first heard this album in the late 6o 's when it was originally released starting with the first track quot blood of the sun quot i was hooked leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure his throaty singing and driving band featuring felix pappalardi made this band one that should be placed on the list of quot great ones quot probably due to the many other better publicized bands like led zeppelin and the like leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet open the closet you guitarists out there and give this cd a try i do n't think you will be anything but delighte	9
1	if you are looking for true hip hop this is a must for your collection four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd quit buying those fake ass hip pop albums and get the real deal from the production to mcing its all there matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks	9
1	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
1	this is a must have for anyone with an r b oldies collection you wo n't be disappointed	9
1	quite different from his later big band recordings some of the songs that you may find on wes' 'best of' collections sound too much like elevator music not so with this debut album a drummer a organist and a guitar player no horn section stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing he shows of his trade mark octave playing his chord solos \( played over the organs rythm chords none the less \) and flashy runs across the fret board when needed a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz	9
0	the cd came as promised and in the condition promised i'm very satisfied	9
0	this was the worst thing i 've ever heard except maybe clap your hands say yeah my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever	9
0	it' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music in some cases the music go to the hand with the story but not in this cd in which we say the music that it is not for the story i did n't ejoyed with that c	9
0	oh this is pure adult garbage all right i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this then again the movie was garbage also	9
0	this is another rip off cd 3 songs and a video do n't make this a good purchase i expect a cd to have at least 8 10 songs on it	9
1	i'm a huge matchbox fan and i listen to a collection of all 3 albums all day long i never get tired of it ! rob thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me his lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me what a great band ! what a great album ! what a great musical ride !	9
0	it is bad ! as much as i like 10 new songs this one disappointed me a lot	9
0	just another cd of the awful awful techno crud that has infested goth industrial clubs while real artists like cinema strange and knifeladder get the shaft worthless on every level	9
1	i have been a brickman fan since the very first album much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much electronic enhancement escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano if you are a brickman fan this is a must have album	9
1	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent	9
0	unfortunately i forked out 14 for this cd upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green 's previous work also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist use this as sunday background music on a rainy day but do not expect to get the party started with this album	9
1	i'm just starting to become a true fan of pigpen earlier i just did n't get him and i would constantly skip forward to more of the gd extended jams lately i 've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows i'm glad i picked up this set it 's pigpen 's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory pick it up note the rest of the band has some fine moments too ! !	9
0	i have to admit i expected a lot more from mr setzer the first track was ok then it proceeded to go down hill from there not much rockabilly happening then it all comes clear with really rockabilly when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans world wide he even gives us aussies a serv even though i do n't think he has ever set foot here if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing jazz rock or whatever then go ahead but why slag your old fans \? it 's the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first	9
0	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson \? the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it \? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la 's lysa flores north of the border	9
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am i really do n't care much for this album i say thank goodness for creep because we may have never heard from them again \( or at least not in the same way \) if that song had not become as popular as it did	9
0	if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is n't it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is n't one of them i'm glad clapton is now in a happy place \( and deservedly so \) but this cd just does n't do it for me	9
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time oh my god i am breathless i was brought to tears as they sang mama my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could thank you for touching my heart i really recommend that you give this cd a chance all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score obviously need a hearing aid and a heart blessing	9
1	this album has morse code on it what more can you say well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres complete with t6 buzz and slow drift and the music is pretty good too	9
0	quality is poor some songs are not playing avoid buying amazon	9
0	hey that just goes without being said all of their live albums suck because they suck go creed ! i ca n't wait for scott stapp 's solo album ! awesome baby	9
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd have some of the songs as performed by other artists but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer i'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity	9
1	this is an amazing beautiful album probably a little more difficult to get into than streethawk but after about the 4th or 5th listen i found it more rewarding the music is very dense and the lyrics are beautifully poetic \( it helps that dan bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time \) a great album for any fan of intelligent independent music	9
0	bits of beatles zappa queen \( herman 's hermits \? \) may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator elfman 's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal musical pieces they have fairly banal repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music has the creepy competence of a dave grusin album if you like that you 'll be ok here	9
1	this is a great movie soundtrack ! i'm a passport fan since i was a kid back in the 70 's i have all klaus doldinger 's official releases with his passport signature please go and look for this cd running in real time from passport and listen to track number 2 auryn then go and get all his passport releases \( almost 20 cds since the 70 's \) then you will see why klaus doldinger is very creative	9
0	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong i click on one song and get another from on the list what gives anyway	9
1	any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission these pieces each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for quot new age quot sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully crafted music weave its web it 's quot feel good quot music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor	9
0	this is not i repeat not five stars ! in all honesty it 's more like 1 5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug atmosphere albums like overcast godlovesugly the felt project and the dynospectrum album is much better than this though the lyrics are thought provoking but slug has been better the production does n't hold up it 's some of the weakest i 've heard from rhymesayers there 's only a couple tracks that stand out but i 'd have to say do n't ever f king question that is the best if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album slug spits classic verse after classic verse	9
1	this is the best cd i have ever listened to ! i highly recommend i	9
1	this arrived the other day i pre ordered it two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion its about time this was available on cd and here it is sounds great ! go get it for the collection	9
1	as always opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these bach cello suites starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this cd that this edition the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not technically perfect but in many ways his most mature interpretation you can spend hundreds trying to find a mercury copy of the perfect rendition or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist at the height of his humanistic understanding of music and of life	9
1	all i can say is you must try this !	9
1	one ca n't go wrong with this one a classic which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night and a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra before the days of electronic music	9
1	forget the nit picky comments you may read here if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album buy it ! the recording is of very high quality and i agree with another review vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better the banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live one other observation if you buy this not having a huge appreciation for sammy already you will be blown away by his talent thanks to sinatra family for releasing this disc hopefully many more are forthcoming	9
0	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical a better alternative would be to listen to either a \) the original artists who influenced this bandorb \) someone at least trying to do something new with music to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super cool reputation if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry you 're not	9
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album it dies today rip off the former bands style but they are still a very good band in the over crowded metalcore market of today that is a rarity my only complaint is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice \( as heard on the radiance \) but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music still 5 5 material though favorite songs the radiance freak gasoline fight our disintigration and the caitliff choir defeatism	9
0	metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton as this album is prime evidence of he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here also newstead only gets one song on this album which is ironically the best song on the album in the history of metallica this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial	9
1	the best r b band ever ! ! ! i know some will disagree with me but this is the band that really rock my boat i mean they were awesome and it was n't forced or fake the rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down i am in the process of getting all their cds but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music	9
1	like i said i would i finally got around to purchasing this cd i especially like tracks 9 12 cheap trick is solid as always i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases if i do have any criticism at all it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30 years anyway there are some great tunes on this buy it like i did !	9
0	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know but to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds this is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music another double ambient album seti pharos is a real masterpiece it is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning but you know never judge the cover by its album please if you have any feedback to this write to carlogiova yahoo it i would be happy to share thoughts	9
0	i bought this cd after having seen ken burns' special on pbs the energy that came through on screen in the benny goodman segments does n't really come through in this cd artie shaw said that benny goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability that shows in this collection afterall where would jazz be if jazz musicians did n't take risks	9
1	it realy has been a long wait after jellyfish this roger joseph manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way if you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel and do n't wait for the us release it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the japanese has i sure would n't want to miss any of these tracks very higly recommended !	9
0	je suis un peu d u par cet album c'est morne le son est pas top a tra ne dans les longueurs bref ennuyeux ! mais bon il faut se mettre l' poque aussi ! a qd m me 13 ans	9
1	gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james ernest tubb and dottie west i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should every song is great but the one which i really like is quot the old man and his horn quot this was a song i had never heard it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard	9
1	joan you do n't love me because i'm a guy but i have loved you since 1976 ok so i'm an old man \( age 43 \) so what she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett this album like most of her other albums consists of a mix of old and new songs does n't mattar i love it and the video well it confirms what we have always known not that it matters the music matters	9
1	i dug the soundtrack better than the film the music sounds good through out if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible the musicianship is solid here	9
1	this is their best album easily better than anything the likes of oasis ever managed richard iii going out late in the day and the title track are all top quality if you rated blurs 3 quot britpop quot \( horrible term really \) albums from the 90s then get this its up there with them simple as that	9
0	this cd had the makings of a great recording the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch please record another one but leave popper at home he 's full of a lot of things but talent is n't one of them	9
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french the music is relaxing but not sleep inducing steven halpern composes great music	9
1	neil young 's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs they are very political so unless you are a completest who likes neil young if you agree with president bush this album will be a turn off for the politically neutral or those who agree with neil young this is a good album maybe this is not neil young 's best but it still is a good album	9
1	quem n o gosta de samba bom sujeito n o ruim da cabe a ou doente do p essa letra desse samba serve para definir melhor o cd da marisa monte quem n o gostar dele doente da cabe a do ouvido do corpo etc um trabalho dedicado na medida certa para esta cantora verdadeira diva da mpb recomendo a todos	9
0	i love south music like three 6 lil jon master p but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead man jd is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he ca n't get no one wit talent every song on here sounds like it was hurried up fu k so so de and fu k dem franchize boyz they make me sick	9
0	ryuichi sakamoto 's credibility is on the precipice with chasm a turgid unlistenable work of crud check out coro and only love can conquer hate both sound like factory machinery at work dire dreadful and diabolical stop being the artiste ryuichi and have a go at entertaining your fans deserve better	9
1	i am a motown oldies r amp b soul love songs music lover i like the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come alive to the rhythem and bill withers definately fits right in there i do n't realy have a favorite artist because i like sooooo many of them but if i had to pick my top 10 this album would be in there	9
1	her voice takes my breath away i fell in love with her i highly reccomend it	9
0	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	9
1	i am not jewish but you do n't have to be to enjoy these songs this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album each and every song on here is wonderful some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music and each artist has a page about them including a photograph i highly recommend this album to just about everyone my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs music truly is borderless	9
1	this mos def album is a good album to listen to he shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point why listen to a bunch of guys who have lil in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life love and this country we live i	9
0	too lisa loeb for me sorry maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics	9
1	fournier plays exquisitely imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise although his interpretation is romantic the spirit is all bach with no egoism on the part of fournier there is both serenity and tension in these recordings and fournier 's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available	9
0	please make these songs available to listen with windowsmedia !	9
1	the title says it all im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time	9
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco' and its accompaning popularity it is nice \( and a relief \) i might add to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva which are difficult to find anywhere also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces this is truly pure flamenco at its best	9
0	paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music however content on his latest project white sand is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums the artist collaborations on white sand make it tempting to purchase but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility \( smooth latin or r b \) are lacking overall it is still a cd worth paying for	9
1	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	9
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop the format of the album the presence of rakim his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south	9
0	i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop rock this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub par some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why \? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is mold fitting white noise	9
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo was cast very well its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 and the sisters even though they were n't the leads they all had such great songs especially beth whose song some things are meant to be always brings tears to my eyes its just so touching i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr	9
1	i never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some do n't well willie was one of those that definately did it is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of willie dixon the writer the musician the producer the businessman i listen to his work over and over again each time learning new nuances i did not hear before how incredible is that	9
1	this is a fantastic holiday christmas album doris day 's beautiful voice singing these terrific christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all who listen years of enjoyment a must have for those who enjoy hearing terrific christmas music over the holidays	9
1	wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album its just that darn good of a song but hey the whole album is good the title track is brutally awesome especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd \( iron maiden box set \) and murders in the rue morgue is another classic then there is drifter and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan \( who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort \) maybe not as good as their debut album but still a masterpeice of an album	9
1	this is what music is all about the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note or the raspy delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian it makes me melt and feel so good and pure think if tweaker were to make jazz and really chill out this is what it would sound like you 'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet ever there is everything one could want possibly the perfect record it 's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul absolutely brilliant and definitely essential one of my favorites from the year	9
1	there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology the remaster is splendid another good reason is the great bonus tracks almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store can you dig it	9
1	this book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom and the natural things all animals do it teaches them to be comfortable with without shame the move from being a diaper clad baby to a big kid the drawings are charming ! i bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction	9
0	if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise this one 's for you however dont expect it to change your life much the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche you get what you pay for	9
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back so i bought him another	9
1	this is a wondrful cd and quite a bargin two discs and the very best of nancy wilson i liked so much i bought two and gave one to a friend	9
0	while well produced i was disappointed in the album mostly because the majority of the tracks were re recordings frankie laine still sounds great but it just was n't the same i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly \( and in a couple of cases very \) different in tempo and vocal inflection it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different much slower with vocal emphasis changed i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp	9
1	this is my favorite jazz album of all time put simply this was miles davis at his best the notes on this album simply float and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense do n't let the thirty second clips fool you i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading i took a chance on it and it was the best gamble i 've ever made a must have for any jazz enthusiast	9
0	i played several samples of this cd on my computer while visiting the amazon website and my male cat started meowing along this cd is good for calming a cat and lining his box face it yoko ca n't sing \( unless you have a cat 's ears \)	9
1	i was in walmart 's electronic area \( which is where you can usually find me ! \) and i saw the album i heard unbelieveable and i was sold on that song but could n't find the single the album on first listen was not my favorite but after a while i started liking it it is a great album and i'm glad i bought it talent is a virtue !	9
1	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago i listened to a few minutes of it and was like what is this crap \? and i shelved it for a couple months i then picked it back up and gave it another listen to my surprise it was really catchy to me the music \( and lyrics \) are simple but thats what i like about them theyre simple ! this is a great college rock cd i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub and i suggest you do the same notable tracks are sidewinder what you do to me and is this music \?	9
0	well ok mehldau 's arrangements are n't bad he does a great version of paranoid android but otherwise where's the energy \? there 's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album and i do understand this as being a more laid back mellowed out album but it is still possible to be more exciting energetic or emotional in this style all three of these things are pretty much absent from this cd which ends up making it dull yawn	9
0	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs girls cars and jewelery i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat save your money	9
0	this album is not what i call a album first 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats best track on here is quot i practice looking hard quot probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career i love that song but otha than that quot captain save a hoe quot and quot mail man quot are a discrace he shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track	9
0	all the cds this band has made suck not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made blink 182 sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk pop	9
1	i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re released if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia this is the set for you !	9
0	item never came however in their defense refund was promptly given out i only wish that i had a chance to receive this one	9
1	for those who have watched the movie jaws \( ask yourself who has n't \) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information which gives the overall package a nice touch the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	9

1	i just love this cd over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album it is definetly not just for st paddy 's day this is an album you can listen to over and over the sinead songs are a bit whiney but she does have an excellent voice you can not get better that mic and sting sting 's song is just incredible	9

1	i used to be a bigger fan of joe satriani than steve vai about 10 years ago now i quickly get bored of new satriani albums but vai 's music just moves me lotus feet for example wow words cannot describe what that song does to me thanks steve	9
0	this was not as good as i had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while i am working out but the rest is good	9
1	other than that this is a proper introduction to the heavster	9
1	this album is absolutely beautiful the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album but this one makes the cut each song wraps you in a warm trance a coccoon of well being it has a really positive emotional effect on me it creates an ambiance of gentle strength wonderful i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums	9
0	i received emails about delaying my order three times since it showed that the product was available i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that i am not sure how long you will survive	9
1	i love this cd ! everything they sing about is so true to life it 's a great arrangement of songs	9
0	gnr were a very overrated band i found appetite for destruction very dull this atleast has the band 's 3 great songs in november rain civil war and live and let die get this for 3 great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums ! ! they are not metal !	9
1	i 've been listening to satoshi tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best cd 's yet its one of those cd 's that is a must have before a road trip just play it and let it ride from beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit before you know it your at the end but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again	9
1	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended being that i never heard all of her albums so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin' however for me who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me some of the tracks i love a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like my favorite ones are in order eroticaray of lightbeautiful strangerthe power of goodbyedeeper and deeperthe prodution is excellent and i love the vocals if your new to madonna my opinion would be to start here but a true fan can give me lessons	9
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks i love the wheel but darn if this is n't just terrible there is n't even a single on it i ca n't believe the studio released it thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store the catherine wheel needs to get back together quick	9
1	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album i sure do	9
0	when i played the first composition on this cd i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping but after that this cd is disapointing to me there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd joyce cooling could have made one good cd but in my opinion there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd joyce certainly has potential but she needs to work on her creativity she sound here like an artist still maturing in style	9
0	this album is not very good i am a big fan of life in general at the show and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip but i did n't care becuase it sucked it was boring and it had no flavor not the mxpx i used to know	9
0	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	9
0	is this the same kool keith that created dr octagon dr dooom and black elvis \? quot spankmaster quot represents a regression of creative energy it sounds like keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks it contains little of the genius of his earlier cds with the exception of a couple songs \( quot jewelry shine quot and quot blackula quot \) this album stinks	9
1	for those of us who thought phil collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture think again that was back in the early 80s when i heard this it is mastery distille	9
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people \? sorry i just cant see it i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's if i could only be sure on the first track at all if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !	9
1	no other compilation of garland 's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm all her original soundtrack performances are here sounding magnificent far superior to thin sounding studio re creations this is the real deal assembled with obvious skill intelligence and dedication to the talented legend in a sense this should be the soundtrack album for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back do n't pass this up	9
1	i remember hearing of this band when i was just a lad but i never owned any of their albums and none of my closest friends played this for me so this is a great discovery for me i'm only on my second listen but it 's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite it 's from my favorite rock period the early seventies and it 's not only nicely remastered it 's also remixed meaning they went back to the original multi tracks not the stereo master i wish more reissues were done this way	9
0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band and the horrible more than a feeling they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica's 4th lp today get and justice for all by metallica insted	9
0	any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as boulevard of broken dreams \( a 1934 hit song \) deserves to be ridiculed not rewarded with a grammy i'm just full of original ideas i ca n't decide whether to write a song called wake me up before you go go or grandma got run over by a reindeer or maybe do you know the way to san jose \?	9
0	god i ca n't believe this guy ja rule was never a gangsta in his life he ca n't talk gangsta and stop trying to be like tupac tupac actually was a gangsta your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you 'd wet your pants this guy should be booted out of the game not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s as if he went through it his ruining hip hop yeah and ja stop dissing eminem and 50 you know perfectly well that they 'd kill you in a battle anyday ja rule has always been s go listen to real rap	9
1	spice 1 's just different from every other rapper and he 's awesome if you love hardcore rap you 'll love spice 1	9
0	i was so disappointed with this cd at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all ! they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler \? i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times !	9
0	while i like some of these songs i cannot understand a single word he sings i even heard him interviewed and i did n't understand a word when he sings he spends all the time looking down so you ca n't even lip read i do n't think he has stage presence and i think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who ca n't form words he does n't sing clearly and i just ca n't get into his music completely i think i 'll stick to r b	9
1	a great recording the greatest bass solo ever recorded \( as put by another reviewer \) is certainly a stretch but the album is still magnificent heavy sounds is a title that accurately describes the music buy and enjoy	9
1	the best place to start with the best is at the beginning enya 's the celts \( identical to the original 1980s release simply called enya \) is a beautiful collection of music enya is not an artist where you just get the best of album every cd is a best of in itself	9
1	do i mean the best album or the best singer \? you are correct if you said both ! i saw kristin chenoweth on a pbs show broadway 's best at the pops \( though it was not the first time i had heard her \) and decided to check out the offerings here this is a collection of the kind of music and performances i love she has a great range a precise pitch and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself in an era when singers try to outdo each other re interpreting the composer 's original work not usually with great success she is a blessing	9
0	this is no saw 85 92 as some people compare it to oh no this is a largely unfulfilling listen the tracks all sound too similar i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear but the drum programming and harmonic development is lackluster only track worth burping over is the last one xmd something has he been taking piano lessons since druqks \? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch check out nick forte 's new release young man 's disease which is better than anything else i 've heard this year	9
1	excellent songwriting guitar playing and overdubbing another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive days dawning crying clown fanfare are a few such songs a few songs from wind of change something's happening and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment	9
1	in august 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group main singer was tony burrows of ivy league and flowerpot men fame the first success came with the second single united we stand this cd collects together the three us hits of the session group plus the only us hit of the group that was the face of the session group in concert during 1971 1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group the eurovision winning song save your kisses for me the rest of the songs are a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974 1980 this outfit is still on tour at the end of the centur	9
0	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short shorts once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	9
0	i like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while i'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax this cd just did n't fit there are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast upbeat or there 's too much talking chanting i found myself distracted when i put this cd on	9
0	\( \) this cd is sub par most of the beats are cool but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics	9
1	i do n't see how they can compare these guys to the mars volta or coheed and cambria i can hear the prog elements but it 's more of a rush kind of prog rock shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics they are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band the songs just are n't as epic as a tmv or a c amp c song i think reviewers liken brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice this is still an amazing album that is well worth your time go into it expecting sparta rather than the mars volta and you wo n't be disappointed	9
1	this is a great collection of hits from the 70 's it is packed with hits it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection	9
0	one good song of course the sound of silence and the studio version is far better than this one i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect	9
0	apart from the great selection of soundtracks what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing executed with finesse these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited fuller versions like singing in the rain for example throw in the great price and this double disc set is a must have for all lovers of classic movie music	9
0	hey brrrrruuuuuccce ! what 's the deal \? just about every major top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated except yours why can we buy the tracks editions and get glorious hdcd encoded sound but town sounds like it 's coming out an am radio \? ok you did your best but dubya 's back in the white house for the next four years and kerry 's home in his underwear watching the weather channel you should have plenty of time on your hands now get busy ! let 's see some remastering !	9
1	the one song i know is a remake is goodnight my love i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake but the others with which i'm familiar but do n't have original vinyl to compare only memories seem authentic the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re recordings of old vinyl or cassettes	9
0	this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums he is the king of electric blues you can hear all these songs in great format just awsome playing awsome singing its sure no wonder srv and hendrix really loved albert king	9
1	i do n't like this album as much as their earlier stuff i have liked each release less than the previous and this one falls right in line with that trend the opener quot quality revenge quot is one of their best songs hands down though this is a very good cd but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music	9
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to	9
1	what a beautiful album ! one of the rare albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts i 'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh	9
1	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't and these days that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan	9
0	sucks if you like this album you are a poser that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal one guy i know that listens to norma jean as i lay dying and unearth called me emo for listening to acid bath how stupid can you be \? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal such as morbid angel darkthrone amon amarth old sepultura and dissection	9
0	after a very disappointing viewing of harry 's only you concert dvd i got smart and borrowed only you cd from the library i 'd hoped that concert was just one off how sad this cd is no better than that wretched concert slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish and what happened to harry 's voice and phrasing \? god unbearable when harry met sally come by me what happened to you harry	9
0	ok let me preface my comments by justifying the 2 star rating it 's rodney dangerfield he was a class act as for the cd if you 're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone 's cheesy clavinova then this cd is for you i bought this because of the last track rappin' rodney and boy was i disappointed it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette do yourself a favor get all of rodney 's dvd 's with his standup material and remember him for what he was a comedy legend	9
1	hey there all want to listen to some great songs by a country artist chely wright then go ahead and purchase this cd you will be amazed at the talent chely has songs spanning from her ealier days to her current hits a great collection for the diehard fan and a great gift for those who have not been able to experience the very talented chely wright	9
1	i 've always liked tevin campbell he had a beautiful voice and really did it on break it down i particularly like break it down shhh brown eyed girl among others excellent cd overall	9
1	this cd has tons of power and soothing energy it really shows off how well part understands the human voice	9
1	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's swanee and rock a bye although every track is just excellent the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby	9
0	this music is a rip off all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy a shame	9
0	blues singers should n't try to go mainstream if they do try and succeed fine that means they 've stayed true to their roots when they try and fail \( as susan has done with hope and desire \) one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started for me that was just wo n't burn i guess when one is happily married with children it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them you 're faking them	9
1	what else can be said about this great cd \? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs child of vision is the best \( the piano solo is killer \) of the best but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end \( no skipping over songs you do n't like \) a true classic	9
0	this cd is pretty awful you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd one of the worst songs ever is calling it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground na na na na na na na na i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer	9
1	i like this album its got a nice mix of old and new material along with some live material great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game	9
0	it 's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album mother mother definitly rips of stairway to heaven from stairway 's ending vocals riff \( and as we wind on down the road \) does she give zep credit on that \? now that rockstar supernova has used the song twice it has brought mother mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me good female yell and complain song but i just ca n't get past that riff rip	9
1	the performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful this is the kind of material one can expect from deutsche grammophon wonderful music a wonderful violinist wonderful interpretations and wonderful sound \( not just for its time \) there are also very few squeaks and he is almost always right on pitch ! often called definitive this is the one to get highly recommended	9
1	being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals i must say i rate this as quot one of the best quot the dancers are fantastic ! the music utterly great the choice of dances \( from classical to rock \) is highly deversified can't wait till i get it so i can play it again and again as well as quot rock the house shake my bootie etc quot	9
1	i 've been waiting for this one this disc and this group period was funky movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period can you see the light is a tight jam as well one of the many bad groups from back in the day	9
1	please do yourself a favor and buy this cd ! whatever you do dont listen to it in your car though no kidding aside i almost ran my car off the road because i was laughing so hard	9
1	this ancient jazz classic never sounded better rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24 bit he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic just keep them coming rudy	9
1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is 'is it for me' it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful \( at most times \) pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums	9
0	holy cow i was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this horrible sophomoric insipid yuk this is like chinese water torture drip drip drip on and on yaaaggghhhh	9
1	ahh this is a great cd i listen to it every day it 's fun music and the lyrics are wonderful hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do	9
0	there are 2 good songs on this disc stinkfist and aenema the rest are pure crap half of the tracks are n't even songs they 're just a bunch of noise no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your 14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap if you gave this cd 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely	9
0	will not run on my computer love the content however i keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my mp3 i will be demanding a refund ! do not buy if you have a mp3 supported car stereo if you plan on playing at your computer it will not work due to ill conceived piracy protection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey and personally like a lay 's potato chip not able to listen to just one yeah i need the whole thing	9
0	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds	9
0	this entire cd hbo special is stolen material all this material was originally written performed by bill hicks buy hicks dvd bill hicks live satirist social critic stand up comedian if you want the material in its true formhttp www amazon com exec obidos tg detail b0004z33fk qid 1130712550 sr 1 1 ref sr 1 1 104 5459925 2315938 \? v glance s dvdbill hicks was also paid tribute on tool 's aenima album	9
0	having listened to steven 's previous albums greetings from michigan and seven swans countless times i cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album stevens blatantly rips off his own music i consider michigan to be sufjan 's masterpiece do yourself a favor and start there	9
1	this is one of the most beautiful restorative collections of celtic music i have ever heard haunting sublime harp cello guitar flute and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation prayer or simply unwinding the mind and emotions the poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself highly recommended	9
0	the cat carol is the most depressing christmas song i have ever heard not to ruin the ending for you but the cat dies ! did n't exactly put me in the holiday spirit	9
0	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it is n't allready i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago must have been on the album prior to this but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative do n't waste your time with this	9
1	as a collector of musical scores i thoroughly enjoyed this selection it is rated as one of my favorites but i must warn that if you do not like instramental style music then this is n't for you but if you are then this is a must	9
1	so incubus rocks no matter who you are or which of their albums is your favorite plainly put this album was not my favorite of theirs it 's good it 's really good but if you 're expecting incubus good you 'll be slightly disappointed	9
0	i think someone forgot to tell molotov that rap metal rock rap was dead had potential but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me	9
0	i bought the cd because i thought it was instrumental music then i hit the tracks with vocals yikes ! this is the only cd of lee ritenour that i bought i am a first time listener i must say that i do like the instrumental music very much however i really hate the tracks with vocals	9
1	the guitars are n't loud enough and neither is the bass for that matter which is so true but it 's still a great album seeing them live makes up for this cd no doubt stand out songs the city sleeps in flames the world as we know it just a taste my darkest hour empty glasses the only medicine'my darkest hour' 'empty glasses' are my favorites i know those songs by heart	9
1	all i want to know is when is the next album going to be released \? i ca n't wait ! this album is fantastic	9
1	i recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like i was listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh life on planet groove will be a welcome addition to your collection great for the drive	9
1	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try i am happy with all of the tracks some tracks remind me of beatles a little but not all so the band does have a unique sound even though from the 90s the sound is like many bands making it today i like it	9
1	sounding thing occurred when ex springfield messina melded with loggins and it was large ! c s n amp y strove to be this good every time they released a tune this compilation not only displays the music crafting abilities of these two in conjunction but also showcases their power to deliver dynamic live performances dedicated to todd j	9
0	i agree with the other negative review below uninspired simply forgettable radio trash cliched lyrics \? check muddy simple riffs \? check boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks \? check thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself judging from all the positive reviews however it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves \( if they 're still around i hope not \) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music	9
0	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again it was my first time and probably my last liz snyde	9
0	some of the songs here are good most notably never be forgotten beautiful i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing herein lies the problem the song is good the voice is good but if she sounds like faith or martina there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there add to this that this is mostly bubble gum pop and not country there 's really nothing that stands out here why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there \? that 's the question	9
1	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time surprisingly evans' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings highlights are the amazing quot waltz for debby quot and earl zindars' waltz quot elsa quot easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written in my opinion you simply cannot go wrong with this cd	9
0	hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they do n't mention is that it 's impossible to listen to there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of there are no songs it 's just a sound collage or something from start to finish the booklet prints lyrics but i could n't find 'em this music is too brilliant for its own good and you can forget about using it as party or background music jdub 's other offerings are much better	9
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade thus putting me in constant cravings for new material though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch truly vast and intimate at the same time and a voice that speaks to something very deep sad and lovely inside you	9
0	not the type of music i had envisioned much slower than i was hoping for	9
0	this cd is awesome from beginning to end i really enjoy listening to this type of music this cd is a must have	9
1	sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting its not what you would really consider to be a religious album but there are many undertones that help get the message across this point being made very clear in museum of iscariot which talks of jesus from judas' point of view rowan 's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album from low opera type to screaming in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old if you are into relaxed darkwave goth music this is a perfect album to purchase	9
0	this cd is without a doubt amazing stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig his tone is crushing sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song	9
0	this album is n't not very good at all there are about four songs i like first off the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats then the guest artists do a sub par job lyrically then there are no new verses from biggie on the album they should have stopped with born again because album will be a forgotten one not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls	9
0	jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse seriously think about marc bolan trying to sound like a '50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like	9
0	when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring unfortunately one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this if you want to hear them at their best buy the 1st album happy trails or lost gold and silver	9
0	as a huge counting crows fan i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them right up until the time that i listened to the cd it is nearly impossible to get through the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke i rated it one star because there 's no 0 star option if you have any intentions of buying this cd find a website where you can preview it first and thank me later	9
0	actually garth hudson the former organist of the band does not play on this cd \( nor 'every geriatric rockstar 's' \) the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins messina	9
1	marias and srayle if you like the guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the winston personally i think the winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on guaraldi 's works the piano is brillaint sounding and at volume thru a good system sounds like there 's a piano in the room it should be emphatically understood you are buying winston in this case and not guaraldi i have both versions	9

0	man can she get anymore stupid and talentless she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career just because your a great actor actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing too some actors actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez she needs to quit the music business while she still can please stick to acting oh wait ! i forgot she ca n't do that either !	9
1	jodeci 's forever my lady has a problem that most nineties r b releases had at that time if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa jodeci 's first cd had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one cd in 1991 stay forever my lady come talk to me u i and i'm still waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash	9
0	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un inititiated i am writing to confirm that assertion i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas tellingly this is the final song on the album otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times	9
1	when this album first came out i felt jilted but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album make no mistake if you 're a die hard 80 's rocker you 'll hate this album the production is raw and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed but that does n't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record if you can keep an open mind i think this ablum is one that you 'll love	9
1	evan dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop punk songs this album rocks like lovey and is almost as catchy as come on feel i 've been listening to this album for weeks on end	9

0	aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time they only made 3 decent songs in same old song and dance seasons of wither and janies got a gun rest of the songs just stink explosively avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band steven tyler screams he ca n't sing at all \? \? \? this is music for drug addicts	9
0	quot modern quot usually sounds like some outdated mid 80s new wave album by the cars flock of seagulls or somesuch it is not a punk record mostly midtempo pop the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful shelley 's are considerably better the usual wry lyrics and great hooks i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff newbies should buy quot operator 's manual quot or quot going steady quot or dig up the amazing quot different kind of tension quot from a used record store somewhere ! also see them live if you have a chance	9
1	anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life \? right before he enters the bus i would love to listen to it again but i ca n't find it anywhere	9
0	this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work frankly it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators some of the craig chaquico style stuff was interesting but better left to craig try 7th heaven mosaico or guitar odyssey instead	9
0	this album is dull and without any emotion the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud	9
0	yeah i am a big fan of moby and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise but fail to build up to anything everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style which were almost humorous except not this much money humorous i am not a fan of this cd i know he was starting out in a punk band but his other stuff is much bette	9
0	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it i ordered the soundtrack from the movie but it was not the soundtrack they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack i was disappointed	9
0	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub par testament release testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience this is not a horrible album but compared to any other testament album it is easily their worst only the die hard testament fan or those into commercial metal should pick this up	9
0	this was just to much country for this parrothead i liked one song piece of work and that was about it	9
1	bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz he is also one of the most creative on this album he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning move has a smaller more focused sound that it 's predecessors and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion bravo !	9

0	i would n't recommend this table some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken and i 've only used this table on three camping trips too bad because most of my other coleman gear has held up really well	10
1	i started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago i picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head it has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have 200 racquets	10

0	the day we received the stroller we were very excited we put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction however when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming we have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company i would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time	10
0	you cannot sit upright in this chair bad for soccer games \( why we bought it \) the chair is designed to lean back the company is not amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth unless you plan to sleep in this chair it stinks	10
1	these bands were recommended by our son 's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them but they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked before using these bands his legs and arms were covered with bites we are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others	10
0	the first time i used these push up bars the flimsy plastic they 're made out of cracked in three different places perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely but i'm not going to risk an injury finding out in the trash they go i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
0	i was so happy to order this it has n't even been put together yet in box for two weeks they sent the wrong hardware with it i emailed them 2 times and got no response after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice she was nice and shipped the parts they arrived today and guess what \? the same wrong parts again i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together at least i have a list from the owner 's manual overall experience was a big fat bust	10

1	this product is wonderful ! it sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music we received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2 5 years old and still loves it we keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear	10
1	i bought this stroller after much research and deliberation it is comfortable for my as well as my daughter it handles wonderfully it folds pretty well too the front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature i am tall and it helps to have the handle where i need it i have used this for both walking shopping and jogging and think it is perfect ! from purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days i am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase i love this stroller !	10
0	this product falls into the category of not worth the cost of shipping for me the bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat the bag was shipped in an envelope via usps first class mail for 1 35 samfe was the retailer that amazon used for this transaction so free super saver shipping was not available samfe charged 7 50 for shipping i generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits hence the low star rating for an otherwise adequate product	10
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail refused package a month ago exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them since amazon takes no responsibility vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel refund order amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you're stuck with erroneous charges beware ! !	10
1	this is a real good ramp i just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air ! overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major it is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time they are fun and you will have hours of fun ! ! ! \) \)	10

0	our kids loved this so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on off button \( making the toy unusable \) i bought another one would n't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later \? this toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion the manufacturer needs to correct this problem	10

0	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit anyone honestly that tells you differently is wrong	10
0	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other i would not recommend these for anyone	10
1	i love these workouts they are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners the best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day my only complaints with this series were the lack of attention billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves all in all this was a great purchase for me i will probably purchase the new bootcamp elite series	10
1	it was just what i wanted a relatively stress free low impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv takes about 30 minutes to put together it 's quiet stowable and fun my ten year old likes it too i do n't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as i'm wearing shoes so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue had n't been wearing shoes a really nice little machine and what a great price	10

1	i bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer according to the gift recipient they 're excellent they really do n't leak or fog up he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes \( but please note he does n't swim for more than one half hour at a time so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity \) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types for the price these are an excellent bargain	10
1	great product i just received my ball today i could n't wait to work out if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max fitness	10

1	i just ordered this beauty the price is right the price will probably be more expensive in a few months the full tang is very sturdy the handle is usually a lil thin \( flat \) on these type of blades i was also looking at the galaxy viper twin blades in silver \( also comes in black \) but there 's no pic of the shealth it just says it 's nylon shealth it holds the 2 blades this was n't exactly what i was looking for so i chose the ronin btw i got the last 1 from a seller they were out of stock last time i checked	10

1	i just switched from a suunto t6 to a t4 and this pc pod works seemless between the watch and pc it is about 2x a paper clip and with the usb connection it is easy to carry although a little pricy from the competition if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the t4 foot pod and pc pod work very well down side is the software which does not support mac come on suunto	10

0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus ovewrall i cannot recommend this product	10
0	the gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people would not take it back said he 'd had it too long i will never buy this product nor work with this seller again horrible	10
0	i did n't like these at all the toes are too pointy and would n't fit might be ok for younger children than stated	10
0	overall the item works well if keeping track of one player it is just fine when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two	10
1	this watch heart rate monitor is everything i wanted i can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face i havent used the other features yet but appreciate not wearing a strap hrm anymore	10
1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best the thickness \( 1 8 inch \) is just perfect not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable	10
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find i was told easy to use my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning	10

0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top when we put that top on we found the same thing that is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product	10

1	recently we had a chance to use a bongo board about 40 years old it was all wood with quite a large drum the one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons it is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity the drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost and balance is frequently lost finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them great investment for year round fun	10
0	well first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture then when i sent an e mail trying to exchange the product no one returns my calls or e mails me back after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy so yeah if you want a better review contact me so i can exchange the product	10

0	this fitness mat is thick and cushy but i find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it 's about a foot too short my biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover \( a major reason i selected this product \) shrank to a completely unusable size when i washed it \( in cold water line dried \) now i'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable	10
1	i 'd do business with these guys again the shipment made it on time and was just as i expected the only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when i opened the box	10

0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so i thought i might like the alps chair too i was wrong it 's very light weight but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time i used the chair the next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless save your money on this one	10

1	i 've been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it 's just the dead battery the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it 's actually easier than it looks i highly recommend this gun	10

0	i returned this item as it did n't fit my 19 pound boston terrier well at all it was way too large for his body small obviously means small for a larger dog instead just be aware !	10
0	this product never worked buttons were defective it would n't stay on it would n't calibrate the seller sky box usa would n't exchange or refund because i was outside of the 30 day window \( this was a christmas present and a very disappointing one at that \) you 'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a casio watch	10

1	i am so glad i finally found an online source for these visors i 've been picking them up one or two at a time from street fairs for probably 20 years now you can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos because they are so light and comfortable and they keep the sun out of your eyes \( or the rain \) and these particular visors here on amazon had good snaps too	10
0	i bought this ear plugs are uncomfortable my ears hurt and in the first use just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc are better	10
1	i have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily although i have not had this one long it has shown no type of wear and i use it every day ! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout	10
1	this spring is of industrial strength it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs better than any made available at your local hardware store it 's only about 4 in long so it does not take up much space however if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag	10
1	if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of well look no further this is the best tank ever i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them	10

0	unfortunately this product did not live up to our expectations it did not last one full season the bottom braces not reinforced very well	10
0	initially a very good buy however after only 3 days of very light use i had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk and i was in another room for the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case	10
0	the present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use the newest presentation has solved this problem	10
1	mine is blackened scratched dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more but i love it this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow i think it 's part bucket this is the one	10

0	i got this item to give a a gift i got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded do n't bother with this one	10
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it 's funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it 's stable worth it \? not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat \( 5mm model \) it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value \( reasonable price \) and it 's biodegradable	10
0	your money could be well spent on something other than this not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal mart	10
0	i consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big i think that for a small backpack that they are just too large thank you	10
0	both me and the mat slide all over the place it has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis	10
1	we bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday he loves it ! his older brother \( 3 1 2 \) has the regular razor scooter but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself this kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother good for the younger kids but it does not go as fast as the regular razor as a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two definetly worth the money though he just loves it !	10
1	my three sons and i saw these pogos demonstrated at the cleveland x games a couple years ago we could not beleive what we saw this is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen for the money it 's a tremendous value and their customer service is the best i have come across they also make a high \( er \) octane version called the flybar 1200 which supports larger riders for adults \( yes adults will love this thing ! \) or kids this is a must have this christmas my youngest son ca n't wait for their next model \( flybar 400 \) due in '07 i believe an absolute 100 thumbs up ! jim woods akron ohi	10
0	i trained for a marathon and several 10k races using a heart rate monitor they are very good instruments for training and i recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape after you 've purchased one or two of them you become a better shopper i purchased an f 4 for a friend and i was very very disappointed in the battery life when i found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out some of the newer heart monitors nikon for one have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years	10
0	it only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs does n't run well over pine needles or leaves \( make sure to rake the yard before riding ! \) the acceleration in slow the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens i spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing it stops when the child tries to make a tight turn all of this was on the grass it was advertised as being rugged off road capable when in fact it only works on the paved driveway do n't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person it 's been 3 days and still have n't heard !	10
1	there were a few minor imperfections but i'm overall happy with this sword the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable	10
1	i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy	10
1	highly recommended ! ! ! ! my wife uses this pack for nursing school as you can imagine she carries a lot of stuff this pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps i would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school	10
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them she was n't really used to skating either but has done very well on them not too many falls and learned easily great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin	10

0	i was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat i got neither it is pretty but that is about it	10
1	difficult to put together with just one person though not impossible seems better for a child under 3 feet tall though my daughter and i are making do she loves it	10
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here these are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc the length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves the 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts that is why ringside makes different lengths there is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	10
0	i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift at first he was thrilled to get a new one upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain making it almost impossible \( and very uncomfortable \) to use he had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way he did however like the other features namely the light and the pen	10
1	i 've had one of these for 13 years one for thirteen years it still works great please use it carefully if you 're going to use it you can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure \( or not \) repetitive stress syndrome to completely avoid that and any similar problems you 'll need dr sonnon but in the meantime just be careful	10
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob	10
1	i am not an exercise person but i need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they should n't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints this machine is perfect for all of us i put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy the electronics on it are working just fine it 's the kind of exercise machine that i can get on watch tv and forget i'm actually exercising	10
0	i ordered the igloo quick and cool 150 from target i had it 2 days after ordering it was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used back it went be careful ordering from target in january they have to do something with those christmas returns check out the product carefully	10
1	and so does gadget dad and gadget kids not only is it an affordable piece of equipment but it 's great for the whole family having twin boys age 13 and a husband and i who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives this does just that ! i 'll admit i was a bit upset when i found that gadget dad had ordered it because i was the normal skeptic but it 's been well worth the investment and then some	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless a waste of over three hundred dollars	10
1	i purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it does n't reset i like the fact that i can open the lid and read the led without taking it off my only problem is the little leash it came with both a plastic and a metal clip the plastic clip has lost it 's springiness and i'm sure will stop working soon but at least i have the metal clip to fall back on	10
1	for the price not a bad piece of home gym equipment cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good	10
0	this front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when i went over a medium sized rock	10
1	i like this whistle 's slim design i wear it when shopping in rough areas if i am apprehended i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant this whistle is much louder than my voice and carries well across other sounds	10
1	it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it	10
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far it is built well and the price was awesome	10
1	it was a gift for my niece she loves it she 's only 7	10
0	hydrolized gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend do a search on that and you 'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones mmmmm does n't that sound good \? what 's more this gelatin protein is incomplete so it does n't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles it may taste ok but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them or just eat jello if you really want gelatin avoid ones with collagen too same issue	10
1	i think that the sword itself is great the casing is cool and the mounting wood is nice the only things i did n't like was that the keychain greiver fell off once i took it out of the box i also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade otherwise i think that i got an amazing deal	10
1	i got this for my daughter awhile ago but due to no snow i had to wait to actually see if it worked well it did ! nicely made and durable daughter loved it	10
0	and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery i have half the cable now good price and attractive product for a low security environment	10

1	good quality well made hat with offical mlb sticker under brim well worth 4 99	10
0	i also bought this because it was the consumer reports best buy and i expected to get a lot of use out of it the frame broke on my first \( i weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week \) after about 1100 miles and its replacement just died after only 350 miles so far i 've paid about a dollar a mile i 'll never buy from schwinn again	10
0	the snap on the leapers elite drop leg holster \( the term elite must be used loosely \) would never stay attached it would always either unsnap or come loose at the back eventually it fell off in the field and i lost it the straps would never stay securely in the place i positioned them the leapers deluxe drop leg holster is much more effective even w one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place the method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well spend a few more dollars for the deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the elite	10
0	rec 'd this pitchback and assembled the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults very disappointed	10
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days the bearings were in great condition	10
1	sword looks awesome ! very heavy and cool blade is strong but not sharp for collector purposes handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky but can be fixed quickly overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking	10
1	this product is excellent ! very sturdy durable and the videos are challenging but doable from beginner to advanced you will get the results you 're after i highly recommend this product	10
1	i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown \( the kid not me \) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins as for age requirements the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age i say that 's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her him how to fall correctly ie not on unpadded body parts like your hands and red works for boys and girls so if you 're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it 's double the price stick with this	10
0	i brought this pedometers for my church s walking program and we are not happy with them my pedometer keeps falling off with a leach also the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero if i had to buy over again i would not buy this pedometer	10
1	i am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet but my carpeting did not have enough padding so i decided to order an exercise mat i a very please with my order i noticed the difference right away the cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome	10
0	i bought these skates last year with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them when i tried to take the wheels off they would n't budge ! spend the extra 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years when the indoor wheels on these die the skates die too these most definitely are not roller derby skates since those girls change their wheels all the time !	10
0	three days after i put this on my keyring the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together then a week later the compass popped out of the case it 's now in my tool drawer perhaps only mine was this fragile	10
1	this rack works perfect for me it as easy to assemble and its easy to use it folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use my bikes have curved cross bars so this mounting style was my only option and it works great	10
1	i just bought the speedbelt 2 deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me so far the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5 10 mile run range it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle for longer runs i 'd suggest the 4 bottle belt but this one is great for the intermediate range the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all recommended	10
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs \( the screwdriver heads the small blade the scissors \) and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics camping or canoeing \( the saw blade the large knife the toothpick \) there are still a few tools i have n't used but overall this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money	10
1	purchased this tricycle for my grandson 3rd birthday a huge success ! ! ! ! not only was it reasonably priced it came w free shipping great deal	10
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking but after i say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket but still i think the basket is a piece of junk plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable i ca n't recommend this basket buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanksdarealdeal	10
0	first of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me 2 weeks later the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun but it looks cool and its worth the price	10
1	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen shorten the strap again does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability great for spotting oneself too i would buy it again tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe so if you can burn the 35 or so get it with no fear otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout	10
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec 6 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service	10
0	this was given to me as a gift i used it almost every day for about 1 1 2 months then a cable on it broke it never even worked that well to begin with i e mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come they gave no apologies they could not have cared less eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame	10
0	this tablecloth bleeds as soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms ! i ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect ! go figure ! avoid these	10
0	graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product this rack will scrape the paint right off your bike the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords ratchet tie downs etc this was a complete and total waste of money and damaged my bike on top of all that it is not an inexpensive rack ! save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack	10
1	this gun was great when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it good for kids just starting out with bb guns also it is n't that powerful overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is 0 0	10
1	this was a present on our girls 3rd birthday she rode off an on from 2 until 9 she loved it so much we could n't wait for the battery to run out for the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car quick to learn how to drive it loud \? \? a little bit but hey it 's a kids toy if they did n't make noise the kids would n't like it great toy ! ! great value !	10
0	small very small kit not as advertised every item needs expensive batteries	10
1	the plastic side mounts \( 4 \) appear to be solid and not flimsy i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones \( you know since this is going on a boat ! \) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless the package says includes all stainless mounting fasteners so i guess that means hooks only the supplied screws are not even galvanized so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat go get stainless screws that are also 1 2 longer than the ones provided all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get	10
1	just the perfect cap ! it fits like no other swimming cap it wo n't pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning very resistant material and a great finish awesome colors !	10

0	i purchased 5 of these for christmas presents i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time number 1 this was dead in the box so were numbers 2 3 and 4 i did n't bother with number 5 every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge there is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is real junk says hummer made in china and all five are going back	10
0	description of bike was misleading weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds although i weigh slightly less than this i am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart i would not have purchased the bike had i seen this limit in the description also the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated i thought i was purchasing a simple exercise bike not such a complicated piece of machinery this bike would be perfect for a younger more athletic slimmer person	10
0	i bought this item based on other people 's reviews i'm sad to say they were wrong maybe it 's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box the gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as i started firing it it sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go my recommendation well just look at my title	10
1	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore they love to wear them everywhere they go great way to get the kids physically active !	10
0	i ordered 2 of these flimsy tables they were not only expensive to ship but one arrived damaged the one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully meaning that people 's drinks would slide off the table these are the most flimsy tables i have ever encountered if it were n't for the replacement tables i found at costco the party i planned would have been a disaster	10
0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work \( or weather \) complications if you are like me that means weekdays late at night or very early in the morning i'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes my neighbors ca n't stand it hey i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner to give you an idea i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models	10
0	i thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope it was n't it was pretty limp for the price i suppose i got what i paid for	10
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me i urge you to buy something else	10
0	i was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good when it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy 's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2 4 people i kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch the pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox	10
0	the accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical \( who 's going to use a slingshot anyway \? \) but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage it 's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle	10
1	i got a pair of these boots for christmas and even though i'm not sure what all they can be used for they are great ! the construction is top notch they 're easy to use comfortable etc i seen cheaper boots on the market but when i'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete tile floor in my house i want the best product for the job	10
1	my daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off	10
1	great mat provides good purchase even when getting sweaty it is a bit short if you are above 6ft \( like me \) to do ashtanga but is great for hatha yoga	10
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item i think it is a good concept but it does n't work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything it is awkward to drink from too i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation	10
1	this is a wonderful gym it is similar to the boflex but without the high pricetag delivery was very fast i am very satisfied !	10
0	scary looking but inpractical the wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already \( if your fists are that big you do n't need claws \) the talon shaped blades are sharp but ca n't dig in they can only scratch they even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard nice wall decor but nothing more	10
0	placed the order on 11 20 delivery was supposed to be by 12 9 on about 12 1 i contacted the company that amazon said was the provider unbeatable sale inc to verify that they did have the order unbeatable said that it was an amazon order period and gave me a number at amazon to contact amazon said that unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at walmart	10
0	as the previous reviewer said i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper but do n't make a mistake it 's impossible to correct if it is possible i do n't know how as there are no directions using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical with the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made and you probably wo n't even know it just a horrible design and a waste of money	10
1	great condition made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs and the dolphins are my team ! ! \( she wo n't forget her gave her this one ! \) quick service great packaging	10

1	i bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in colorado i recently went in january and it worked nearly perfect ! every location i could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet the thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly the watch looks great i wear it to work nearly every day i would highly recommend it	10
1	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising selected the armband carrier it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the ipod firmly in place it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device if you sweat a great deal while you exercise i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine would recommend it to anyone who asks	10
0	i can do this without the system it 's simple why do n't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything	10
1	this sword is awesome i thought it would be cheap metal because of the price but it is even better than some of the other swords i bought for more money	10
0	other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason over 65 of the decks are marked and unusable that means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be ok for poker play \( unless you 're lucky \) i have purchase casino used cards before and honestly they are not worth the trouble	10
0	advertised as having a coaster brake not advertised as having a 6 speed not has a 5 speed if i would have known this i would have opted for something else	10
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two after applying one vial it seemed even worse than before \( tread catches as i walk \) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable \( still not great \) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality	10
0	i 'll be returning right away suction cup does not hold at all completely useless	10
1	we bought this for our 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loves it ! it goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride brakes work very well riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius given the chopper style long nose quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall i suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety easy to put together a no brainer well worth the cost he told us he loves feeling the wind in his face shirt sleeves flapping i think we have started something i may not want to deal with as he gets older future harley riders look out !	10
1	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store awesome toy for infants since it 's light easy to grip and easy to bit my son loved this toy for 2 3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys	10
1	it looks like a cartoon snail and it makes a racket when you squeeze it i 'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be	10
0	this is a 22 tee ball \? maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place since these should cost about 2 at your local sporting goods store maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package \( but it does n't say that clearly on the page \) bottom line is do n't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue	10
0	i ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations but i expected it to project sound at least a short distance when we tried it out all we got was feedback words were not audible at all when i contacted the seller i was told it was a novelty item only which i think is a ridiculous answer since even a novelty item should work a little maybe the one we got was broken i did n't try again since the seller did n't seem to think anything was wrong with it when i called and the shipping which was not refunded when i returned it was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	10
0	while i like the functions this offers the screen is a bit hard to read when riding also the instructions are n't very easy to follow for example it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions do n't say how to convert to miles hour i would probably not buy this again	10
0	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine unfortunetly the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment	10

1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now and this is by far no doubt about it the best thermos ever invented i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in 20 degree temperatures all day at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot if you need to keep liquids hot this is the best non electric product out there for doing it	10
0	three of these broke granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed but to no avail my wife received something similar from spri \( doctor 's tubing \) and it has lasted for a few years now	10
0	well the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good i dry shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen ! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank ! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games 1 5 out of 5	10
1	this little trike is wonderful ! ! ! my 2 1 2 year old loves it as does our 5 year old neighbor the ride is smooth and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers without the high risk of tipping over i looked for a trike for many hours days and am so happy with this choice	10
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses the hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip	10
0	i bought this over the yakima equivalent for the locking accessory what a mistake i made the racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work i called thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to rma it i sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case but i would steer clear if i was you	10
1	i bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and i could work out together it 's a little heavier than i 'd recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you 're done !	10
1	i am very happy with my choice it is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute usage is very convenient it has that perfect click into place property you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position to hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame it does the job perfectly and it feels great	10
1	my 9 month old loves this toy before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls he would roll it on the floor and crawl after it it keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it also there are no loose parts or pieces to lose which i appreciate great toy	10
1	i just wanted to comment on sarah 's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated i took it in parts after reading it fully twice after all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard overall i got it done in parts total time 2 5hrs with breaks in between have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten	10
0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company i just received my weslo cadence c44 treadmill and have attempted to assemble it the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console the customer service numbers are all disconnected their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them this company is a complete scam if you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10

0	and buy a gps instead i agree with previous reviewer \( dave57 \) i would never buy a suunto again worst than dave i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water could n't even tell the time i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and kindly offered a repair for 140 euros	10
0	before buying ddr i read everyone 's reviews and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it this product really fools you this is why if you 've seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like well the dance pad and the box looks normal untill you turn it on ! it says 50 songs right \? well it 's not really 50 different songs about 20 25 of these songs are a trick they combine 2 songs and make it into one track the graphics are horrible a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are i would n't reccommend buying this at all	10
0	i bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old he liked the boat well enough even played with it when it was sitting on dry land however in the water this boat is very tippy requiring two adult hands at all times not good if you have more than one kid and need that extra hand i bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer i would n't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat	10
1	this works pretty well to get back and forth between classes although you can tell that it 's a toy at heart if you 're looking for something fun and easy i recommend this scooter	10

1	this review is for nike t 90 club team \( 32 panels \) i bought this ball for less than 15 thinking i could n't go wrong i had n't used nike balls before so i did n't know what to expect it turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls great practice ball and pick up game ball i would have no problem using it in a small club match either as far as my 30 adidas balls \? not a chance 5 stars based on performance vs price i hope you get as good a deal as i did \( through eastbay athletics \)	10
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs	10
1	i have 20 mo old twin boys i was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the disney mcqueen trike so i had to purchace another one this trike has two different sitting positions has a wide wheel base for stability and sits lower to the ground my boys still ca n't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy it 's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early !	10
1	the jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient it doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them i had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said i never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal	10
0	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles and pins while camping then this is the item for you the instructions are made only to confuse things more it could be made so much more user friendly once it 's up it gets a thumbs up	10
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes	10
1	my thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers this is a great backpack with lots of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my l l bean i recommend this bag	10
0	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle one of them worked perfect snug fit and everything worked the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic this is my second and last purchase from zefal i was happy it wasnt made in china but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis	10
0	this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else the first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable after a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit amazon promptly replaced the treadmill this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function my friend at tech support did not have a clue he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit it is not clear what i am to do with them i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer	10
1	these gloves are pretty good gloves if you 're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go they are very traditional yet slip on design	10

1	i 've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the butthead golf club cover and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been playworld putt putt there 's also no dress code involved there now on to the review ! i strongly endorse this butthead golf club cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten fun ! those teets really help my handicap like you would n't believe many clubs have a problem with this cover because they 're incredibly elitist but when i think of golf i think of cow teets and that 's why i refuse to play without it	10
1	ca n't really go wrong here a metal post some rubber grips and a couple of wheels it works great and was the cheapest i found just a tip if you 've never used it before do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet you may be tough but you might also hurt your back start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy	10
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent \( great for hot yoga \) and very non skid it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands wonderful tool	10
1	i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the 400 lbs besides the floor the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot but it does its job	10
1	it 's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you do n't want on the ground toilet kit socks towels etc what a great idea	10
1	excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap i used before	10
1	this gun is really cool ! it has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb 's at a time but hey you ca n't have everything anyways great buy	10

0	hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it	10
0	a real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings if not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main \( front \) sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if very heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal mart or target for half the price	10
1	i have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather over the years i have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size this cot will provide everthing that i'm looking for my sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot the cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag the only down side to the cot is it 's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag in short it 's all a good fit and i hope to enjoy it for years to come thanks da	10
0	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck it would have been better with metal zipper	10
0	i bought this bike thinking since jeep put its name on it then it should be a great tough rock solid ride ! boy was i wrong ! not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy its mechanics are worst part after taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally 10 of its gears still do n't work now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job let me tell ya i stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still did n't work overall i 'd have to give this bike two thumbs down you 're better off buying a bike from walmart	10
0	this machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled i could n't believe it my advice would be to avoid this product	10
0	the hr monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use no use any more also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists not at all comfortable on mine	10

0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar the old 724 had metal connectors making them plastic is insane these connectors will break over time additionally a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors	10
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer	10

0	i was thrilled when i received this knife it was cute small and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom emergency situations however after less than a month in my purse the floral plastic cover \( which in truth i thought felt pretty flimsy when i got it \) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other sigh	10
1	this is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun but a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections \( they will jam the magazine \) pros very high cap ! more than enough for a spring gun ! cons a bit long and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit \( but still worth it	10
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times on the 5th day my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole	10
1	this has been a great addition to my truck a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system \( and without having to learn another techno gadget \) my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night	10
1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great as has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it 's worth it in my opinion the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent everything else i'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration	10
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost you get what you pay for she uses it a few times a week after a little more then a month the left pedal broke she is not overweight at all so that was n't the problem i 'll spend the money for a good one next time	10
0	i am disappointed with this product as i thought i was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which i give to my patients this one is made of nylon and elastic the stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use the elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart go with the stretch out strap which i have been very pleased with	10
0	i rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid 's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child 's bike straight but i never recived the part i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they did n't help me i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs thank you	10
0	even though this is a receiver hitch mount item it does not use a standard hitch pin it is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch \( must be bolted into the hitch to remove must be unbolted \) this totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch versatility the ability to easily without tools change whatever is mounted in the hitch bad thule ! bad	10
0	i loved it the first 2 months i had it with out notice the cable shredded i called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me it seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it the customer service is bad and so was the product	10
0	this stuff has a very strong smell like wd 40 or something if you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought but it is n't odorless it really stinks i do n't like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room i recommend the lifespan 100 silicone lubricant it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it 's the good \( odorless \) stuff	10
1	the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey ive used it since it first came out and i love it strings break a lot it seems like i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque	10
1	i purchased two chairs one for me and one for my husband for me the chair is perfect i weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good ! ! \( chair is way to small for him \) i love it for myself because when i take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories ! ! i would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places	10
1	very cute skateboard ! very girly ! the only thing wrong with it is that it 's very gritty on the top which i'm assuming it 's like that so that you do n't fall off however it hurts ! ! ouch ! other than that it 's cute	10
1	i have used this bench for a little over a week for the price you ca n't go wrong it is sturdy and seems to be well made the adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place \( great for lying leg lifts \) all and all this is a good bench i would have given it five stars but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses this is not true it can almost go vertical but not completely still i think you would be happy with it i am	10

0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems i put on the valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in my advice this product is poorly made and cheap a complete waste of money go with something better and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric	10

0	let me just start by saying this gun is terrible the images are misleading the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic but it is a dull black and it smells really badly at first not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps and is sold at 300 my friends did n't even notice being shot i have a 300 fps pistol it leaves welts through jeans this isnt 300 fps it 's a rifle fit for an infant who 's been dropped on their head and thinks it 's good never even shot farther than 80 feet bad buy	10
0	i was going to give this product a 3 because the trays acutally quite nice just as the previous reviewer i love handing out chips in them however i re read the name of the product and i had to change my vote to a 1 these chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating not only during game play but afterward when i'm trying to store them	10
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just would n't part with it my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night \( almost 22 months old \) i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous	10

1	this step is great it really adds variety to my home workout i use it on carpet and it really stays put it does n't slip on the carpet and i do n't slip when i step on it i was a little worried because it did n't have a rubber stepping surface but it really does n't need it with regular athletic shoes	10
0	the product is well made and a great idea for travel without a mat however i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating however although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface your skin slips out of them when you sweat making them worthless guess i will stick with having a towel around !	10
1	i bought one of these for friends that have children and one for a friend who is married without children they all seemed to love it !	10

0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
1	this product is phenomenal it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly it worked under my wetsuit it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming it works between your thighs or on your chest when running it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running but i ca n't directly confirm that i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours	10

1	the leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage \( throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my leeks ! \) fortunately kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked i just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife the knife itself opens beautifully though i 've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and is n't that easy to depress with one hand	10

1	if you 're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles this is an excellent choice it 's also very quiet and it 's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me only problem is that i wish the seat adjustment were easier to work it gets a little stuck sometimes again if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice	10

0	difficult to set up ! netting rips far too easily avoid this item ! be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough	10
0	i purchased these so i would n't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat however they did n't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws additionally after only a few classes the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws particularly on the foot paws i guess they would be okay for someone who does n't ever have sweaty palms and who does n't do any intense postures otherwise i would recommend doing what i do now use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
1	i bought the large and x large sizes i would say the large size is standard for most travel but the x large is best for packing clothes because they quickly fill up space the large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch	10

1	we bought this bicycle for our son 's 3rd birthday he loved the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride ! it has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels but the bike stays steady while he is riding and does n't threaten to tip we are very happy with this bicycle	10
1	this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition all metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal	10
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
0	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit i am sending the gps i just purchased along with this software back to amazon the software will not communicate with the gps and the company will not respond to any of my support requests the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available and the live technical support is a complete joke after 20 minutes of being on hold i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english and offered me no help i knew more about the software than him and i 've only owned it 3 days i 'll never purchase from magellan again	10
1	for some reason the electronic control panel does n't work on my bike but i do n't mind too much the bike is small and light but has enough mass so it does n't slide around i use the bike while doing work watching tv or reading it 's a great way to get exercise on rainy days	10
0	it is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market this pump is 100 junk so bad that i am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump the instructions were a disaster and why would i need to look at instructions for a pump \? well that is because it does not work and i mean does not work at all ! the lever on the side is a total gimmick \( does nothing as the previous review states \) save your money here do not buy this pump	10
1	it is the best backpack i have ever seen	10
0	even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product \( as described \) i still would have returned the item the mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it was n't really suitable for the intended purpose	10
0	this thing simply does not work ! i bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and i cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this it cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls i tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if i get better result but no luck	10
0	had to return the first one due to non functioning thermo and fault compass small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts	10
1	a standard 5' bar not sure how accurate the weight is it feels more than 13 pounds but that could just be me not a big deal either way	10
0	this cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline but every single time it rains i have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle ! it is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly more damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it ! this is a worthless item	10
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 usually ships in 24 hours it actually took 1 week to ship it 2 when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have leather band the band was made of artificial materials \( nylon and rubber \) or something like that i will have to return it	10
1	this product is n't a miracle product but it does do a few things it supports your back it is comfortable it does make you sweat \( mostly on your waistline \) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit it 's not a bad product overall but do n't expect a miracle you have to do the work for this product to help you at all i do use it any time i'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects	10
0	there was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts my son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road he could not it is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface	10

0	the first schwinn fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit the second one arrived but does not work after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re examine the contacts \( which i did \) it still does not work this is absolutely useless they will have to do something	10
0	prior to purchasing this item i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe i wish i heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis i developed severe toe pain by using this product i then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead	10
1	first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful the sight is really good and its adjusts its also really accurate the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu	10
1	this is the perfect monitor for the average person the chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so i do n't have to look at the watch while using the machines while walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate i have n't used the other features that are offered so i ca n't rate them but it does everything that i wanted out of it when i purchased it	10
1	our card group of ten people play president which requires three decks and a large table this unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever 's turn it is i added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other	10
1	i used this for paintball on my military simulation a 5 i see other sights and i was worry about this since its cheaper the red and green dot is much more visible then my brother in law more expensive bsa also about the manufacture website it is a 40mm dont know why they said 30mm but like some sight the lens \( both front and back \) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up down left right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly overall it worked great i can tease tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them	10
1	the pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price the odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate the set up and operations get easier with use \( first few times you will need to refer to the manual \) the manual is well written and thorough the cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate	10
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon amazon was great and sent me new one this one worked for a few days i then had the battery replaced two weeks after it stopped working by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent in short the watch is awful	10
0	these skates are very comfortable but within ten minutes the stopper had busted no wonder this item is no longer being sold	10
1	very nice good coverage of light lights can always be brighter in my opinion easy installation and good battery life	10
0	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !	10
1	i got this gear bag and love it it does n't have a lot of the features you 'll see in higher priced bags its really just a durable mesh duffle bag but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins boots masks snorkels and any other small gear like defog gloves knives wrist compasses computers etc	10
0	this product does not work the vendor is great though they refunded our money very quickly we were very disappointed because it is a great idea	10
1	this is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping you have to remember it is not a crock pot though the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware i did n't therefore a crock pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product certainly this is not the product 's fault but owner error a very good product highly recommended for campers and tailgaters	10
1	great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym it 's heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym 's heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage cuts use a drywall t square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter take several passes to cut it and take your time it cuts straight and square for a professional look i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym	10
1	just a really great sports toy for kids my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun	10
0	i just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym i now have painful calluses in my palm the glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand	10
1	i had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever i leave the house one night i was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when i realized i had it on me i had no choice but to throw it out so had to get another one	10
0	i got one of these because it was only a penny i used it several times with only a slight crack that i later cemented later i used it again and while cocking it back the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces the gun is fun for about the first few tries then it 's prone to jamming up even though it was only a penny it was 4 99 shipping i'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market i'm not very satisfied but i'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back	10
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together just took a few minutes and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug	10
1	this ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do you 'll be surprised by the results	10
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments yes the bag is n't huge but it certainly gets the job done it 's not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it 's a bag that has style that 's why i got it it 's a bit more european in its design and is of good quality i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon look to be good quality also at this price it is such a good deal	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10
0	just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked the pack itself though is very nice many pocekts for keys cell phone ipod ect	10
1	very well made product easy assembly and mounting the no wobble feature is excellent highly recommend this product	10
0	i was surprised when i received what appeared to be a sales brochure i searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if i had missed the book entirely but in fact the small clumsily put together manual was in fact the 3 75 book that i bought online it has some new exercises in it but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them	10
0	i paid bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it	10
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship i did n't really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword	10
1	this is a excellent product for certain needs it is unmatched for ease of transport \( i can easily carry four of them at once \) the only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold this makes perfect sense of course if they were sturdier they would be heavier a common sense approach to usage place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge will insure safety and longevity of the product all in all a very good value	10
1	this is n't a weight loss tool it just helps to sweat off excess water retention i have noticed a considerable difference using it with my daily workout !	10
1	i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money	10
0	overall not terribly happy with this units user interface and design the spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as sw1 sw2 etc but they are not labeled as such on the device you toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are \( tr ch what \? \? \) just an unfreindly interface all around look for a better unit	10
0	my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed \( this has now happened twice ! ! ! ! ! fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days \( slow leak \) what a waste ! it is so heavy that it would cost 20 to mail it back for a replacement do n't bother	10
0	the very day i received the armor abs 2 i used it and all the bands came loose that same day i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab	10
1	i 've tried lots of goggles these are my favorite i did n't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly and i remember the days when the one piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well these are adjustable strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit and it 's comfortable like the one piece goggles and has a no snag silicone strap	10
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box the product was scratched and parts were broken fortunately the bench works but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage the product seems to be of quality it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	this pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls but there 's no way to attach it securely to the pump ! the instructions are completely useless does not deserve the one star	10
0	the bottom bolt broke a week after purchase which prevents the unit from functioning as designed it cannot swing out of the way	10
0	not amazon 's fault but everlast 's even the box promises 2 10 pound weights but it is in fact a 10 pound set of 2 5 pound weights this is not a bargain but fairly expensive quality is just ok not flimsy or dangerous but not what i wanted either	10
1	here 's a secret for the uninformed this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you 're a regular ebay seller it 's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two but remember it 's a secret	10
0	broke first time i used it when it worked it was highly inaccurate \( i own a radar speed detector \) save your money	10
0	indeed these are way too short for protecting your knuckles my boxing coach laughed when he saw them ringside make really good long wraps which are better j	10
0	i thought this would be the ultimate gym bag the main compartment is too narrow your shoes will not fit side by side you have to stack them the pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough the zippers are cheap and stick it is very pretty but not very functional my 16 00 bag works much better	10
1	on the basis of the first review here i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up i use it every day	10
1	this is the best racquet i ever have i 'd been using wilson for a long time \( 5 racquets \) this one is the lightest and the most powerful i have improved a lot and no more pain in my elbow \( tennis elbow \) thank you for such a great product	10
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
1	this movie is the best b movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot but this one has it all	11
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	this is definitely not the typical look at the death camps this is a truely horrific look into the reality that was the death camps i wish it was longer but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours with the option of just listening to the soundtrack that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated	11
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	11
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention this is not the book this is the vhs movie section i see many book reviews but not a single movie review i'm glad everyone liked the book but we need to see if the movie is any good here i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book but i have seen some movies do a terrible job what about this vhs movie \? has anyone actually seen it \? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price used rental copies for 22 to 125 is outrageous one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money	11

1	the breakfast club one of the best movies out there timless no matter what 's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie !	11
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11
1	but it 's the core 25 and if you look at this as its own piece then you 'll be satisfied the visuals are great gary cooper is great and ayn rand 's premise is all here and for those of you picking apart rand 's philosophy and its role in architecture yes the movie is an exaggeration the book is too that 's the point	11
0	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	11
1	this is an ideal movie for home theatre i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl jason robards is utterly evil in this movie i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection	11
1	i was about to buy the dvd since i found it in a store near home i am glad i read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the dvd and that the poor reviews get deleted \( the ones about sound quality that is \) this is one of my favorite movies and i 'd really like to have a copy i wish there were far more foreign films in this site there 's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around	11
1	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting \( and fast ! \) thx 1138 is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don't buy this dvd ! instead spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch 's involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars \( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover	11
1	i 've never seen the original time machine versions before but i absolutely loved this movie i am of course a big fan of special effects but the story is fascinating ! i 've watched the movie several times and every single time i'm blown away the story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds you 'll continue to wonder where the story will end up if you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel then add this movie to your collection !	11
1	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11
0	this movies rates right up there with schindler 's list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence \( aka the civil war \) watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 2005	11
0	i thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable	11
1	bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining	11
0	it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end and about 2 3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion	11
0	this movie does n't have a single scene worth watching femalien 1 is in another league do n't waste your time on the sequel	11

1	i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head or when she accidently dyed her hair green or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie with gorgeous scenery unforgettable characters and plenty of moments to laugh and cry	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
0	there is no actualy snowboarding or skiing its a boring chick flick with a ranting sissy main characte	11
0	i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch	11
1	this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view	11
0	i'm an animation fan and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out while the animation was fine \( although a tad creepy \) i found the story off putting its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a k a substance d i found this film depressing and annoying i particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch it almost gave me a headache 1 star did not like	11
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con	11
0	ca n't understand what all the fuss is over this movie it 's cute but so boring i could hardly stay awake	11
0	one of the worst movies ever this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on	11
1	this movie is a wonderful follow up to the first anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time i highly recommend this movie to anyone	11
0	i'm a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it 's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen	11
1	this film is a stunning tribute to the memory of all the victims of this tragedy and to all the heros who contributed to our triumph of the american spirit	11
1	this was the best series on television in the late 1980 's my sister and i never missed an episode yet it still is n't on dvd i can buy i love lucy and dawson 's creek but i ca n't have all three seasons of my beloved vincent and his velvet over gravel voice what the heck gives \? please put this out on dvd ! !	11
1	i 've never seen a movie with a more accurate depiction of life in the ussr from late 40s to early 50s what people had to live with psychologically far outweighed anything physical for the average person buy this film to understand	11
1	this movie really surprised me the first time i saw it there is much more depth to the story than you would think martin short is very funny nick nolte is great and the little girl is adorable i highly recommend it	11
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie for those expecting a movie like a hard days night it is nothing like that this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady i wont tell u the ending but this is a true story all in all i thought this was a great movie you should defiently buy it	11
1	lucas is one of corey haim 's 80s greatest movies i have the dvd you too gotta go get it \)	11
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
0	so not at all what i was expecting i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it i was terribly disappointed and confused	11
0	okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people 's relationships \? \? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked	11
0	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	11
1	even though this cinderella does not have the modern day movie magic \( in fact the sets are pretty corny \) that does not hurt or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl and looked forward every year for the airing of cinderella and the wizard of oz i was thrilled to have found this and would highly highly recomend it to any 40 woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this	11
1	we were amazed that this film was n't an award winner it is an excellent film and you might even see some style similarities between howard roark and frank lloyd wright	11
1	i have seen this movie many times while growing up its definately a different approach to science fiction but not too bad basically you get to see how mortal enemies can work out their differences and work together a movie with a message	11
1	what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person how can you criticise someones life story \? to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp \? i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise	11
1	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester	11
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
0	almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree	11
1	jlo finds out that she cant run forever from her abusive husband so she learns krav maga and gives him a a s kicking to remember	11
0	i love nature and cowboy movies jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen it is unforgetable it was my favorite robertredford movie he did very little talking talking in this movie he just acted his best performance ever the movie deals with the american indian also in a profound and touching way this movie is engrossing and based on a true story it 's simply the best do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie it is a classic it truly is in a league of it 's own	11
0	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn	11
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
1	i love it sooooo much it's the big new thing can't wait 4 the next episode	11
0	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	11
1	the spice girls are the best ! and if you are a spice fan than this is the movie for you i love i	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
0	this movie is watchable but barely its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions and see leatherface as a never mind youllhave to see for yourselves we have a yound renee zellweger in this one	11

1	ok i 'll admt it when i first saw this movie i was only 6 or 7 i thought it dumb and pointless i also thought 'omfg ! what was that teacup thing for \? it was soooooo pointless this movie is stupid ' now i am 13 and i saw it again on abc family then i thought 'wow ! ' this movie is so cool ! i then understood what theteacups represented and everything i thought it was a great movie truely hilarious too of course it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world but i never found it until now this is a very cute movie and i really think anyone can enjoy it	11
1	i love this movie so much i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance \( i know so random \) when i was in my teens i went out and rented it right away and i have watched it about 100 times since then i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon it 's such a sweet touching story it 's a bit off the wall but that 's of course what i love about it	11
1	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere if you come across a copy of this buy it it is reminissant of american history x or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen aged boys comming of age while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen this will hit home for the rest of us drugs are bad ! !	11
1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	11
0	i'm sorry i really really tried to get into this movie and just could n't it was just plain boring normally i love these types of movies but not this one i just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile never happened i would recommend renting this one first just to make sure	11
1	when worlds collide has all the ingredients of a great movie for the year that it was made the actors were great the story is scary when you start to think that this can happen the ending was excellent not a happy ending for mother earth but not all end of the world movies should have the earth been saved i bought the movie and seeing it many time and still like it	11
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	11
1	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness welles is excellent as edward rochester the tormented master of the house joan fountaine is wonderful as jane look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles this material has been done many times but watch this version	11
0	the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
1	this is a wonderful movie and i have always enjoyed it from the first time that i watched it when i was 20 something then to see the actress that plays miss ellie on dallas in such a young roll it was excellent the story is endearing and shows the many facets of ones life	11
1	i think this is a great movie about a guilt stricken ira gunman based on a book this movie will make you laugh cry and excited this is a must	11
1	cannes man was funny i do n't know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster but it made me laugh out loud just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who do n't know their s from a hole in the ground	11
0	this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they ca n't sell it so they 're giving them away hide fast	11

0	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware	11
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11

1	justice in the criminal justice system \? what is that but empty talk in the real world \? in hell shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife 's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system no macho van damme kickboxing here but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate a true portrayal of life in today 's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men and corrupt power brokers who run them	11
0	this review may sound pretentious and ignorant but in truth i'm a big fan of british history so bear with me ! even as a film itself it 's surreal and i do n't like the acting but as with any historical film that includes the british they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france \( i e the hundred years war \) but rapists and murdering pillagers ! \? never ! historically accurate full of british sentiment and down right weird avoid this film today folks !	11
0	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11

0	even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format and for that reason i wo n't be getting the region 1 release of this film	11
1	i rented the movie and i hav n't seen the first three but this one was pretty good it was n't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie good plots and story line i do n't recommend going out and buying it righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself	11
1	it is an fantastic concept for a movie plot just how much trouble can a frozen man from the past get in \? this man is even less refined than tarzan but has a better sense of humour if your feeling down and want a pick me up this is a must see	11
0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
1	this movie is among the top 10 of my favourite movies of all time ! it not only honours the life and achievments of the great christian man alvin york it honours many truths of the christian faith god 's power to to transform sinners the virtue of forgiving your enemies putting god before man the virtue of earning an honest livelihood though it does all this it is not a preachy movie it simply tells the amazing story of a simple farmer who becomes the greatest hero of ww1 other movies in my top 10 include it 's a wonderful life forrest gump shawshank redemption to end all wars les mis rables	11
0	i found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives i was constantly wondering where i would draw the line if i was the heroine the experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy daydreaming	11
1	this is one of my favorite movies ever it really captures life in the 1800 's slums and you really get attached to the characters there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams i 've seen this movie about 3 times and each time i see it it is just as good	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
1	funny and witty this movie will keep you going especially if you love the play by oscar wild	11
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11

1	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
0	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated \( remember hanoi jane \? \) woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess	11

0	a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband \( everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron 's husband \) jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull	11
1	this is my favorite film bar none mpi home video is releasing this title on dvd 5 15 07 according to mpi 's official site in addition as of this writing \( feb 07 \) this stellar film is showing in theatrical re release in as many as 30 american cities this film has everything an epic should have a first rate cast beautifully written screenplay spectacular \( and mostly historically accurate \) settings even solid humor i 've been waiting for this to be released on dvd for years	11
0	only worth the second stop motion sequence when flesh fights a robot twig that scene is almost flawless and as good as any harryhausen animation the one love scene with flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice the film is worth a rent if your curious but it 's really just a lame and unfunny movie if your open to seeing a trashy sci fi satire of flash gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look especially fans of stop motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences	11
1	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine	11
1	there are tons of women in prison films out there there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive however this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women who were full of one liners and crazy notions but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film lots of nudity violence bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house	11
0	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord \? and mad \? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude	11

0	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11

1	i wo n't spend a long time explaining why i like this movie it 's just mindless fun and that 's all it needs to be a movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch and while it 's not the funniest or clever done comedy it 's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them plus that blob thing is just too freaking cool	11

0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i'm very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i'm not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog	11

0	maybe it 's because he is such a stright shooter \( pun ment \) or something but clint does n't do cold war thrillers very well \( remember firefox \) while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they do n't cover up the fact that it was a good book that does n't watch as good as it read some may like it but i found it to be a let down	11
1	great movie excellent condition and as always shipped quickly and in good shape	11

1	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie micky rourke is excellent \( this is still in the days when he could act \) and so is the rest of this stellar cast well worth it	11
0	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
0	fredro starr is a good actor in fact what ever happened to the group onyx \? but this film is cliched and predictable rhea perlman looks out of place this is a 2nd tier above the rim	11
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met head to head this movie answers that question very well no cheesiness we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest great saturday evening movie	11

0	i read this book for a project two years ago i was n't about to finish this book and had to move to another one first off this book lacks emotion this character is so boring she does n't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me a book without emotion is just unreadable i hated this book but i do n't like most scott o'dell books just go read another book	11

0	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	11

0	this is absolutely no improvement on the poor vhs video tape a travesty i subtract all stars for the terrible transfer menu and options	11
0	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	11
1	one of my all time favorite movies great story great acting great casting directing superb i cry everytime i watch it	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	11
1	probably one of steve mcqueens greatest movies only this one can happen	11
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	11

0	sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino 's top gun bit \( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off \) there 's nothing worthwhile here	11
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	11
1	this is my favorite cardio video right now because the video is only 30 minutes long i can easily fit it into my day i found the choreography fun and uncomplicated i especially love the addition of plyometric moves and core conditioning to the cardio i can feel those assets tightening up	11
0	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it	11
1	i love this story for my boys it is now a story i put on for my grandson it keeps their attention and there is always something going on i do wish that the few cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted you should explain that this has nothing to do with your religous beliefs it is really entertaining i love the bird and i love the song bright eyes i would recommed this for anyone 8 and up i do n't think girls care for it as much as boys	11
0	this movie is laughable today it 's very dated and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards it appears like a low budget flick	11

1	i had never seen this movie and i dont know why ! freddie bartholomew \( top billed as a teen ! \) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching a terrific olio of pathos comedy melodrama and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel \( which im embarrassed to admit i never read \) one of the best movies ive seen great supporting work by lionel barrymore john carradine mickey rooney melvyn douglas more and freddie is quite the beauty here a winner !	11

1	the lived tragic story during the ww2 in a small town of the occupied czechoslovak a carpenter is hired arian controller in a modest and humble bottom store where her owner a jew old lady thinks the best about him unknowing what' s really going on backstage i few words a major film told without melodramatic effects but told with asserted expression and crude realism another amazing evidence of the artistic foreseeing three years previous to the invasion	11

0	the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies leslie cheung is a fantastic actor and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express so even though i do n't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies i still decided to watch this movie i was extremely disappointed the cinematography is boring and poorly done the plot is juvenile it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys i hated the movie however i fully understand that many many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made	11
1	this movie would probably not be on anyone 's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980 's b flick movie loving enthusiast ! the stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80 's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious ! i remember renting this movie \( on beta \) in my childhood over and over again much to my parents chagrin the stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is	11
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see	11
1	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	11
1	wonderful and beautifully transferred to dvd excellent production numbers and this just might be my new favorite judy movie grab that bucket of popcorn pop in the dvd and let judy do her thing she is wonderful it will be just a fun evening	11
0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	11

1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature	11
1	this is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book the cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous this film will delight both children and adults with it 's adventure suspense and innocent romance it 's a little spooky in some scenes but of the fun rather than truly scary kind this story has a very positive underlying message but does n't preach rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the secret garden and of themselves no matter what age you are this is a thoroughly enjoyable uplifting perhaps even transformative film do n't miss it	11
0	this film stinks it gives b scifi a bad name even makes those roger corman movies look stunning if possible i would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here if you want cornball underwater action buy quot voyage to the bottom of the sea quot provided that your cerebral cortex is active you 'll agree it 's a zillion times better	11
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11

1	this is a great picture that i think grant morrison was imitating in his first issue of quot the invisibles quot it has cinematography and acting that repressed hollywood would n't get away from for another few years great ending that completely caught me off guard a very complete film	11
1	i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace com check it out	11
0	hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very 80 's campy it was corny then as it is now	11
1	i saw this on tv and loved it so i had to buy it	11
0	quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	11
1	moore shows us that outsourcing was big when clinton was president he makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees big one will open your eyes	11

1	this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source frankly you forget that it is in black and white format	11
0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11
0	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
0	this is not one for the uncoordinated i only tried it once and have no desire to try it again also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11
1	i think simply put if you like bob dylan and just want to have fun with a movie then you 'll love it the performances bob gives are excellent and it 's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together if your not much of a dylan fan and like your movies high and mighty better just pass it up	11
0	well do n't know where to start bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it stuart gorden is director and they did a good job on re animator but let me tell you horror freaks will be disapointed only one really bloody scene is worth watching not because of the blood not because of the gore just because it is the only bloody scene in the movie a nice looking woman is eaten by the castel freak if you have seen re animator the evil dead from beyond hellraiser and maybe the thing then skip this one you will be disapointed like me even a john woo action movie has more blood in it	11
1	freddy rules ! i remember growing up and being afraid of freddy jason on the other hand never scared me to much he was just a big dummy who walked slow now watching the end of the movie how can anyone say jason won \? jason went down in the water and never came back till the end freddy survived only to be killed by the teenagers them selves by slicing off his head freedy won ! but anyway its not a bad movie freddys make up looks great and glad to see him on the silver screen again	11

1	the fly is fantastic and well worth a watch goldblum 's performance is also just outstanding for a really cool creepy interesting and engaging film this is the one fly 2 not so good so dont bother the extras and presentation on the dvd is also great adding to the package here definately worthwhile if a little cronenberg splat isnt gonna offend and watching what could have been a really tacky cheap project done really really well sounds good and if it doesnt get over yourself cause it is	11
1	overwhelming in sincerity and pain to watch and observe stephan 's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time this cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour i was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish a great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
1	this is the best of the best hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will ever see colm wilkinson lea salonga michael ball are all amazing fabulous talent great singing	11
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting so this thing ends and the movie should have also it should have been a 30 minute movie so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs wow what a movie the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie	11

1	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of everyone needs a maid only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	11

0	i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie this movie is contrived the character that reeve plays acts like a star struck groupie personally i do n't find his behavior to be romantic he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him this is not romantic to most women nowadays he is not suave in the role he is playing it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it	11
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11

1	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11

1	high energy encapsulation of the american spirit in this tough tender production done lean and hard scrabble as opposed to the lush and green hollywood version curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is aunt eller the matriarch as done by maureen lipman is tough and loving jimmy johnson the welshman jigs and does rope tricks shuler hensley 's jud is repulsive and vulnerable a classic for your permanent library	11

0	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	11
1	some of the best lighting i have ever seen on face of that hunk c tommy john peters is a genius	11
1	the characters are likable there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film but only about half of the scenes are necessary it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky gene is a funny guy there is no doubt about that but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly except for a few instances of harsh language and violence but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days it is worth a look but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story	11
0	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
1	my brother henry always said this was his favorite movie he loved film noir \( although i did n't know what that was at the time \) and of course he loved richard widmark in his role looking back widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this \( he was nominated \) but there are many oscar should 'ves if you like prison gangster movies classic film noir richard widmark victor mature and of course brian dunleavy you 've gotta see own this if you hav n't do n't already	11
0	this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson 's performances not to mention jeff tweedy 's music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there was n't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you do n't need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	11
0	there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	11

1	this movie rocks man i'm so happy that they finally produced a stephen king script almost entirely true to the original story more than that it 's about 99 accurate they added some stuff like a new female character played by julie entwistle that was n't in the book but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending normally i'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first but this time i think i can confidently say that even non readers should like this movie it 's a masterpiece of suspense and gore rent it folks and call him the night flier	11
0	sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful	11

0	i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it 's cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole	11

0	i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more	11

1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11
1	micky dane \( robert patrick \) a paparazzo photographer is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder this movie has great action good acting and really catchy music body shot is another robert patrick movie that i 've seen multiple times \( probably about 12 so far and still counting \) you gotta love patrick with his blond hair ! i am biased and give this a perfect 5 stars	11

0	most l amp h fans know that the boys made a long series of mgm fox pictures which reflected the big studio quot assembly line quot film making approach and the wartime atmosphere students of film comedy understand how the quot traditional quot stan amp ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard however it 's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go completely to waste as it does in aaw the presence of edgar kennedy should lift th proceedings instead it reinforces the melancholia i found the drunken scene most distasteful still l amp h followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11

1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times ' to reference hannah arendt this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	11

1	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci fi such as star trek \( the newer ones \) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was v the final battle is the second installment of the saga so make sure to buy v the miniseries first the storyline is good and characters are likeable and three dimensional i highly recommend it for any sci fi fan for old hands it is a fun movie and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	11
1	this is a very dark film kevin reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a high school but this picture has nothing in common with to sir with love this is much more than a simple fairy tale carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for samuel jackson	11

0	this was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by sir arthur conan doyle it did n't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters the plot and scripting are incredibly weak it seems the editors just stopped mid movie and rolled the credits there the cgi dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff in my opinion not worth the 83 it costs	11
0	i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on \? or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the 80 's flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie	11

1	cary grant was a great actor with countless memorable films although that this film is not amongst his very best it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure it is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some disney influence but grant offers us one of his typical \( in a good sence \) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs enjoy it	11

1	i really like these tapes the first one is pretty easy but it is very relaxing and i use it on days when i want to take it easy the second one is somewhat challenging and the third one is even more so these tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one tracy rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable i also like how they \( ganga white and tracy \) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced	11
1	i loved it the movie arrived so quickly it was awesome it has brought back a lot of memories from my past thank you	11
0	i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it i was not shocked with the horrible acting but was surprised with the hot stars this movie had both hot guys and girls the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht freddy he is so hot we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body he did a great job in his breif scene josh edwards trian was okay to look at too as for the actress venesa taylor is also hot	11
1	all 3 wiwag are excellent this is more than just a well put together documentary its very moving because of the footage narration and music you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's after watching this you wish that things today were as they were back in those days not just baseball or sports but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds	11
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11

1	wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember but still a great movie especially with the deleted scenes they are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old but still allot of fun to watch	11
1	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert granted they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim this is truly a broadway event the documentary which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	11
1	one of th ebest comedies of the middle 90 's this is basically your average quot rich kid learns to be a man quot story it features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and the mermaid if you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look	11
1	this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio	11
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era katharine ross and sam elliot it 's just fun not really all that scary or even too tense basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance roger daltry makes an appearance the deaths are all way over the top and it 's just fun dvd is the movie plus a trailer that 's about it but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire	11
1	i have watched most of the bs series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations religious control	11
1	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	11
1	for me quot get a life quot provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy from chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien \( in home video volume 2 \) which is anything but cuddly i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of quot get a life quot episodes	11
1	i have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and i wish it would come out in dvd my liking it has something to do with john 's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the direction of the characters through the machine once he damages the typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again you ca n't beat that we even get to see a perplexed robert wagner and the rest of a great cast	11
1	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie but this movie is a definite exception it possessed a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly captivating scenery that is incredible and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie it piques the curiosity it warms the heart and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it buy it you wo n't regret it	11
1	do n't let the price of this cat necklace make you think it is tiny and almost invisible ! ! it is a very good size and the carving is great ! it was so inexpensive that i bought two of them i'm thinking i might give one to my fellow cat lover friend ! great item with a great price !	17

1	these earrings are quite nice yes they do look brown up to the light but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow they can be worn to accent an elegant look or add style to a friday casual look they may not be heirloom quality but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category	17
1	i bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my wife and they look great my wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out they came in a dark blue velvet jewel ring box which comes in another dark blue box my wife really loves them so that 's a bonus for me they are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
1	i loved the earrings but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back the package was lost in the transition but amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful the earrings were beautiful and of good quality	17
0	battery died within a month i had already gotten rid of the packaging	17
1	the bracelet is a very bright and shiny quite nice it 's alot lighter than i was expecting i almost mistook it for plastic at first it would make a nice gift for a young teen girl	17

1	having only owned fossil watches prior to this one i must say that i was a little jaded my latest fossil bit the dust after many long good years of use i happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design i have to say i was highly impressed with what i received it is an absolutely beautiful watch	17
1	thanks for the prompt delivery great packaging a beautiful watch sleek and chic perfect size for everyday wear and more active wear great features easy to use	17
1	the charm itself was slightly smaller then expected but for the price it was fine shipping time was good	17
1	i bought this watch on amazon for my husband who is an avid runner and he loves it ! ! he sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat \( so he says \) but otherwise no complaints \( and he can be a tough critic \)	17
1	i have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings very nice size and great quality they are light weight and have a great hinge i have a baby who sometimes grabs them but they have yet to be bent out of shape i sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears do n't ever develope a reaction	17
1	i ordered these for my 18 month old daughter and was a little nervous i had never bought earrings on line before i wanted something with the safety backs but i had expereince with some backs that screw themselves off i loved the butterflies and wanted to try them ! my daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we have n't had any problems ! i keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight i wanted a good quality earring so she did n't have problems with infections and we havent ! i will definately order from here again	17
1	never off time never wind never re set the true lazy person 's watch	17
0	this product is not worth the price by itself it 's fair at buy 1 get 4 free the time function works fine the compass on the other hand is virtually useless having gotten 5 watches all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	17
0	i bought this to change my watch battery tools broke after using it once worthless complete waste of money on this cheap toolkit	17
1	it 's a good value for anyone with no time and a small budget ! five stars for value	17
1	i purchased this watch expecting an inexpesive one which i got but i recieved more than that it was cheap in price but definately not cheap in quality my watch has held up to drenching rains and with stood the water resistant up to 50 00 meters label with ease very comfortable easy to reset and has all the bells and whistles i love it ! !	17
1	i bought this watch a month bak an i am really happy wit it ita sightly complicated to learn but overall its absolutely amazing its a steal at that price only pwoblem is that the temperature indicator takes time to adjust	17
1	this heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets the box makes a v day or anniversary gift even more special your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift the watch pillow is plush padded box top and outside inside box is lined with velvet	17
1	we love the watch it 's totally adjustable press the button for glow in the dark feature the two lizards chase each other around the watch too cute	17
1	i had an issue with my ring not being delivered in a timely matter i got in touch with the company and they had a new one delivered to me the next day the person i dealt with was very professional and i would definitely buy from this company again	17
1	this skagen watch is full of class yet it 's perfect for casual wear too very thin so it 's not clunky like a lot of other watches titanium black and the band is black metal as well had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold but now it 's perfect and because it 's not an expansion braclet it 's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist i hope to have this for years to come because i 've not seen anything like it and the price is right too	17
0	i just received this locket which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x mas and had to decline on giving it to her when i received it i actually thought amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in i shook the bag felt for the necklace and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant it 's so small i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself i was very disappointed other then the size and over priced tag i thought it was cute but i will be returning it sorry	17
1	this ring is absolutely gorgeous and i havent taken it off since recieving it but when buying this ring be careful not to take the string off of the bands this string protects you from well insanity i unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands luckily i found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it my dad put it back together and it was fine but i have to admit i'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off if this does happen to you google puzzle ring solutions and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal	17
0	it is constructed nicely however i could not open any of my watches with the pegs kept falling out of it hard to work with	17
1	the watch is just as discribed it is heavy and large the person i bought it for had to get several links removed it would be great for a larger man	17
1	i really like my earrings that i bought and they came in time	17
1	i returned these because they were too large for me to be fair to zina they were as described and i was n't sure they would work the only reason i'm not rating them a 5 is that having returned them i do n't know how long the clasp would work i kept gold small hoops i bought at same time very happy with them zina 's product descriptions are exceptionally good	17
1	i purchased this watch for my 7 year old son it is a eye catching and because it 's lego it was an instant hit it has numbers on the face \( not roman numerals or lines \) which is important when they are beginning to tell time the price is fair the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic it gets a bit sweaty all in all it 's a fun cool ! watch	17
0	when i received the earrings i got very disappointed because they are very very small i had to sell them my wife never wanted to wear them	17
1	this is a great watch for a woman ! i ca n't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man i ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her	17
1	i bought this for my husband he likes the large easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable a very nice watch at a reasonable price	17
1	quality of leather looks nice i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off it 's metal squeazed to leather and that 's what i expected you just have to keep an eye on it and do n't sleep or shower in it it looks nice	17
0	they ship really fast which is nice but ultimatly this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures plus the stone is not garnet it more so resembles the color brown like a turd	17
1	they 're cool some break to easily but others dont it does not feel like you are wearing a watch and they are very small its just like i said they break easily but i would give it 4	17
0	i ordered this bracelet as a christmas gift for my best friend based on the reviews it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price however upon receipt of the bracelet i was so disappointed in its quality that i felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet	17
1	these earrings are a substantial weight even though they are hollow and the filigree detailing is superb ! i fell in love with these when i saw them on the site while shopping for xmas presents for friends and just had to order a pair for myself	17
1	this product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery i am sure it will satisfy me when i want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on but also since i have n scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful i e pliers hammer etc	17
1	i did n't realize how picky my taste is with rings until i scoured amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me this ring is one of the few i found and i am far from a fan of having stones in my rings it has a nice low profile i 've yet to have it catch on anything i'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings but this again managed to sidestep that distaste the stone has no backing so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle tinted by my finger	17
1	i was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring the person i bought it for loves it and as a jeweler herself that says alot i was afraid of the metals when i bought it but she has had no problems overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and i would highly recommend it and the company i bought it from	17
0	the gold balls came off their posts four weeks after use i would not recommend	17
1	received this watch in timely manner very pleasantlysurprised at feeling of weight solid constructionand ruggedness had about given up at getting a watchwith digital dial that was not a casio plastic watch have recently bought the soloman stainless version anda gold vestal model will let my relatives choose whichwatch suits them as a gift gene setchell	17
1	this is a great product if you have lots of jewelry this cleans everything perfectly no more harsh chemicals very fast and sufficient certainly worth the money	17
1	this watch has a large display and easy to use functions i get a lot of compliments on the unique band it 's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty i ca n't think of anything i would like to change about it	17
1	the 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch i 'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist if you like the watch but think it wo n't fit well because you have small wrist do n't worry it fits just fine enjoy after wearing this watch for few weeks i realized i am just like many others wearing the calibre 2100 exclusively now	17
1	i received these earrings today and am delighted with them i read the reviews carefully so i knew the actual size of this item and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are the presentation \( bag and box \) is beautiful looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store i 've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in	17
1	this is an excelllent watch and it does what it promises to be	17
1	the shape of this pendant is very flattering \( elongated draws the eye downward \) it looks great with the windows hoops i purchased at the same time the chain is nice and as with all zina sterling the silver is very polished and beautiful	17
1	although glass they do look like opals and have a lovely irridescent qualit	17
1	lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert key type clasp it 's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular use type of necklace i think it 's best suited for the nimble fingered traditional fashion person	17
1	this is probably one of casio 's least expensive wave ceptors it synchs every day indoors in a watch case that 's not by a window the digital display shows the day date and other info such as which time zone what time it synched i'm just concerned that the analog digital display and receiving every day will make it a battery eater it 's available in different dials but the blue seems to be the most common i give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright and the crystal is acrylic scratches easily but that 's not really an issue because i have about 15 watches and this one gets very little wrist time	17
0	we never did figure out how to make them work the saddest thing was we gave them as gifts to our nephews boys and they could not use them very dissatisfied with this purchase	17
1	i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold	17
1	i bought two of these for my twin two year old nephews who liked my watch they 're too young to tell time but love the watches and asked to put them on in the mornings while i was visiting it has great features to help kids learn how to tell time and the watch is small enough for tiny wrists but with a face big enough for learning	17
1	this is a great watch for my husband mike he has wanted a watch that he did n't have to worry about changing the time on all the time he travels often in his work i also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read getting older posses some vision problems so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage he also likes that it is on atomic time and energy	17
1	i bought this set over a year ago and i love it they are great for trips and everyday use the silver is so good and the posts never bend what a great value	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loves this product it holds his money in the clipper and his credit cards on the opposite side it 's beautiful silver and looks very professional	17
1	original concept it generates imagination through the different colors and designs the child can create and is a reliable watch too ! all that for an afordable price	17
1	lightweight great price self adjustable this was the perfect gold toned watch for me ! i shopped around and amazon had the best price for this watch	17
1	i was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging ! i 've received several complements on the quality and unique design for me it signifies john 15 5 i am the vine and you are the branches i am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry thank you	17
1	just as my title states this item was purchased as a gift my friend loves the pendant but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse	17
1	this watch has it all at a nice price the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand hair if u have and i doubt that u do n't have else is a masterpiece all stainless steel even base thermomener and a smart cronograph plus 3 yrs battery this is my favourite no other watch has this price quality proportion try it and u will be satisfied sporty but looks elegant too	17
1	bought this watch as a gift i was not disapointed another great vaule from amazo	17
1	the pendant was beautiful and was loved by the person i gave it to	17
0	i loved my timex at first i have had it 6 months and have put 3 batteries in it i give up ! i guess timex no longer takes a licking and keeps on ticking i am going back to fossil brand	17
1	i 've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week \( checked against apple network time server \) the watch looks good and i ca n't say i 've had a problem with the digital display if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1 of buyers will actually use it one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers are n't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness a silly oversight hence 4 stars overall though well worth the money	17
1	great features on this watch i especially like the linked timers and the three alarms my wrist is tiny and the selection of holes is great \( i use the tightest \) this does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist and the extra band wraps all the way around but it does n't slip and it feels very comfortable the alarm sound is pleasant the color is great too	17
0	product is not as pictured looks like a dimestore fake i had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids and now have to spend more money to buy her something else i would not give this to a 4 year old let alone a 34 year old i am very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
0	this item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap do n't expect to put alot of money in this because it wo n't hold it my clip broke after a week do n't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money	17
1	i had the pendant in 3 days insted of 3 weeks ! and that from the us to the netherlands many thanks for that the pendant itself is perfect very detaild and it looks great	17
1	these earrings were a great value for the price ! they 're small and delicate enough to wear out but also look very polished for work i would recommend them to any and everyone	17
1	it was a gift and i was pleased with the good quality and workmanship	17
0	i bought this ring for my fiance since i have one and it 's a terrible ring we got it apart and then have not been able to get it back together it 's been over a month now we went online to get the directions that did n't help either plus the ring is so cheap it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape it is cheap and completely useless	17
1	this watch was a very good buy for 45 looks like a nice 85 90 fossil watch the dial looks very elegant with those numbers overall i am very happy with this buy	17
1	i bought this set for part of my fiancee 's christmas and she loves it ! the pearls are a very nice size they really are heavy and shine beautifully they are definitely worth the price	17
1	i work in construction and am constantly having to replace my watches because of damage this watch is great because it is sturdy and can be clipped out of the way to prevent breakage	17
1	the craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate very nice band not flimsy or cheap the world time is very cool	17
1	this is an outstanding purchase at a great price and quick service and deliverythanks amazo	17
1	the watch is super thin you barely know you are wearing it in two weeks i have had over 10 compliments	17
0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
1	this was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it it was shipped quickly which is always a plus	17
0	i have purchased eight of these units over the past year two of the eight have stopped working altogether and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve the seller replaced the first unit that failed and when i requested replacement of the second unit i was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features they could not offer the new model to me in exchange but they did offer a 20 discount it arrived today and seems to be working well if you are considering purchasing any unit made by this manufacturer \( garnin \) consider it as suitable for short term use rather than long term usage	17
1	i was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but i was very pleasantly surprised it has a quality finish and band is comfortable and works great here on the east coast it reliably synchs with the colorado time signal so it 's always accurate great watch for the money i highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings	17
1	bellisimos los zarcillos los uso muy a menudo y el tiempo en que hice la orden fue bien rapida su entrega su tama o real concuerda con las medidas que ofrecen	17
1	i was more than pleased when i received this pendant ! it has a nice feel and you actually know it 's there instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away you have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting but that is all i have to complain about ! definitely worth your money	17
1	the dial is big for some people but being it 's a diving watch i would expect nothing less this is a beautiful piece of machinery and i wear it everyday	17
0	this bracelet is a lot thinner and lighter than i thought it would be i was expecting a chunkier tiffany style tag bracelet but it is smaller and more feminine not what i expected	17
0	seiko has produced a loser of a watch i really liked the design and seiko reputation of building a tough watch i have purchased seiko divers in the past with no problems i didn t know these watches were made in singapore maybe this is why my monster doesn t work who knows toke to authurized dealer for repair he wanted 175 dont buy seiko	17
1	its tough to beat the price of these 1 2 ct diamonds for 199 they looked really good and the wife loved them the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they only have non screw backs and they did n't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got but for the price a minor quibble you wo n't be disappointed with your purchase	17
1	this watch is beautiful i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be	17
0	earrings are pretty but look cheap and very flimsy i know they are supposed to be delicate but they are not what they appear to be from the picture	17
1	it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave ceptor and it adjusts time according to the place you are in so good watch !	17
1	pros the blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut the white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds cons the chain is kind small and thin the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality overall i am a pleased customer i bought it as a gift for the topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain by the way she looks stunning with this necklace	17
1	i had one exactly like this one for over 20 years but finally the crown fell off i am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine i expect the same quality of my new seiko i highly recommend this model easy to read dial \( especially the white face \) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry	17
1	this invicta 2699 watch it 's a nice watch the case of stainless steel polished looks very well solid with transparent case back although there is nothing exceptional to look at dial of mother of pearl clear and clean with not too many words or other dials on it looks elegant the roman numbers are very good for that dial the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions the movement is a miyota automatic with 21 jewels works fine for the price it has poor power reserve so if you do not use it for 24 hours it will stop nothing to worry about	17
1	i bought this at a fossil store for 85 and its worth every cent it has the time day of week date and military time its waterproof up to 100 meters it has a double lock to stay on your arm it is glow in the dark it has a spinning number thing it looks good and is always shinny its only 85 bucks its perfect ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
1	arrived timely a bit smaller than i had envisioned but beautiful and comfortable to wear	17
1	i was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick however i think it 's a decent buy for only 30 00 i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend it comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch very clean presentation when you open it up the white gold really shines the free shipping was fast and i do mean quick i ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day i 've never had a quicker shipment for free before if your looking for a great deal on white gold earings i think you 've found it	17
1	this watch is generally a good watch but there are some flaws in ours not a surprise considering the price one there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning two my son has had the band come apart twice in one month the later probably a design issue relative to all the spring loaded retainers and such and the general range of movement of the clasp	17
1	loving the look of the rolex daytona i spotted this watch on amazon and just had to have one \( at the price \) arrived in a well padded display box with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic so no scratches taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes the watch looks great better than the images on the web and it works as described other posters that have had issues should read the manual ! it does all of the chrono functions and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc fantastic	17
1	my boyfriend found this watch at a retail store put it on his christmas list i purchased it at amazon at a much better price this was a replacement watch for an old timex watch my boyfriend says he loves this watch no complaints at all he says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch he especially likes the large easy to read display	17
0	when i first got this watch i was thrilled it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing at the time i thought he was just po 'd because i didnt buy the watch at the store as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart what a piece of junk ! i regret buying this watch and i advise against it	17
1	being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon com and it is a top class item with a good finish the ring seems to keep it 's shine with no maintanence required as usual the service and delivery at amazon com is second to none as an american living in australia there are so many things i ca n't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them could n't be happier with this ring	17
1	i ordered this as a gift for my niece 's birthday and after receiving it wanted to keep it for myself ! it 's very delicate and dainty however the chain and the cross actually looked like they were very sturdy	17
1	this is a really fun and fashionable watch it has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug i like the pink dial that changes color depending on the angle and lighting the dial looks pink yellow or purple i also like how fossil made the band adjustable remove or add as many links as necessary there is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter	17
0	they could not be any smaller the diamonds or the earrings i should have known better	17
1	it 's not the most expensive watch but it does n't have to be it 's a looker of a watch classy clean and sharp looking mesh band on the wrist \( any i have a skagen also \) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking terrific buy price	17
1	and my wife liked it it 's shiny what more can be said \) i wish the smaller heart was a little larger you can barely tell what it is	17
1	bought several of these bracelets for christmas gifts ! they were a big hit ! perfect for someone who need a little pick me up	17
0	i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from they have very large very visible flaws i know the color and clarity were posted on the website but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair \? people wo n't notice anything without taking a good close up look though and like i said i still love to wear them despite the quality	17
0	i 've owned it for a few months the crystal scratches easily mine has a dozen or more serious scratches which makes the face hard to read not a good buy	17
1	this pendant is much prettier in person it 's got a nice polished finish not satin matte like in the image it hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain i 've already received several compliments on it	17
0	this watch is very attractive however the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times i rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it 's still there when i do with a more stable clasp this would be a 4 star watch but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me \( hence 1 star \)	17
1	my girlfriend bought me this watch its design is great and what 's better it 's super light \( titanium hooray ! ! \) i think no country other than japan can produce this kind of watch citizen you rock	17
1	i love this watch it keeps wonderful time i have a bigger wrist so i am glad it has a latch so it wo n't fall off	17
0	i am still waiting to receive my item so i couldn't possibly rate something i don't have except to say that its taken way too long to receive	17
1	we do n't call our nana grandmother so this necklace is perfect	17
1	i got this watch one week ago its very good looking watch its 85 but looks like 150 watch all of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily it upper dial \( having number 05 15 25 etc \) rotates clock wise this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving its bit heavy but now i am used to it i would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist	17
1	i really like it it 's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one	17
1	there 's nothing bad i can say about this item it is by far the lowest price i 've seen for something of this quality and hey she loved it	17
0	this is a beautiful watch but just a word of warning it is big ! i actually returned it for a smaller one the watch face is 30mm which is quite a bit larger than most women 's watches the face was almost the size of my husband 's watch if you like big watches then you will love this one it is beautiful but if you want a normal size watch i would reccommend that you keep on shopping	17
1	i read the reviews on this diamond just before christmas when it was on sale for 99 00 the diamonds are better then expected and i consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks no visible flaws i am sure if i used a loop i could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair their great for 99 00 diamonds	17
1	i will buy more items from you guys i got them quikl	17
0	as a talisman it is good but the product metal it is made of is critical	17
1	i had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it i found it at amazon com for half the price i had seen in department stores so i decided to buy it it is a fabulous watch i look forward to wearing it each day it looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top it is a great piece	17
1	it exceeded my expectation it looks great and seems quite sturdy i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend i like it	17
1	tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis the times change and we change with them this is a perfect watch and probably you wo n't change your time machine for a long time simple and beautifu	17
0	i bought this watch as a christmas gift for my boyfriend after 2 weeks the round thing on top of the watch came off the seller says it has to be sent to repair and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back i am so embarassed of the poor quality gift i chose and ca n't belive they will not replace it with an apology their answer is just not acceptable but there is nothing else i can do but write this review i have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews i read i was happy with the gift but now i am so disapointe	17
1	i ordered three pair of these earrings for christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted very nice quality and beautifully presented boxed in a small velvet pouch absolute perfection	17
0	these were nice earings which i received as a gift off my wish list but after i wore them about 3 or 4 times one of them fell out and is now lost the post does not stay in place very well i am frustrated because i put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an innovative clasp which avoids lost earings but they did not work well for me by the way after i first wrote this review i called amazon to complain they sent me another pair right away at no charge this suggests to me that others have complained in the past i appreciate that they were so responive	17
1	my husband just loves this watch and ca n't get over the great quality for the price	17
1	small illustrated manual makes it easy to figure out how to use with a steady hand and some patience i was able to re size a couple of my watches it was really handy	17
1	this was a gift and i was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping i will definitely purchased from this seller again	17
1	this is a great tool set the first day i had it we used it to take out a link from my new watch it worked great i'm glad i bought it it will be a very handytool kit	17
1	silver insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of celtic jewellery the drop hook earrings come with nice size faceted oval synthetic amethyst stones very light weight looks like you would pay 4 5 times the price silver insanity just delivers time after time	17
1	these are beautiful small earrings just what i was looking for they 're exactly as described 11mm inside diameter i used the super saving shipping and was surprised at how quickly they arrived i'm very pleased with the entire transaction	17
1	the picture for this pendant is deceiving it is a lot smaller than it appears i know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is nevertheless my wife likes it very much and that 's good enough for me the price was right at 18 00 so overall i think it was a good buy	17
1	these are so beautiful picture does not do them justice gorgeous celtic knot design	17
1	i ordered a pair for myself and liked them stones are pretty clear n cute but earrings are smaller than shown in the picture	17
1	a nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty it is fine delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it the are reflective areas that shimmer every 1 4 inch or so i am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning the chain feels strong and less likely to tangle great purchase for the price	17
1	i presented it to my sister 's daughter and she loved it very much she loved cell phone watch and even box i felt very happy and i would suggest any one to buy this item	17
1	the pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised the chain is a little long \( for me \) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level but it 's so lovely i have n't bothered to find a new chain	17
1	this bracelet looks better than the picture it looks beautiful on my wrist the fifty bucks that i paid for it was a real bargain i love it there 's only one drawback it 's 8 inches long and that 's too long for my wrist if it fit perfectly i 'd give it ten stars i 'll pay to make it smaller it 's made of titanium and maybe it 's too tough to alter i want it to fit over that knot on my wrist if i can get it altered i 'll wear it until the day i die which i hope will be 100 years from now	17
0	the pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design it does not go with the center design i think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either	17
0	the ones i received would n't lock anbd were bent i need an address to return them and get a refund i do n't have the receipt	17
1	i am very impressed with the detail work on this ring it is really eye catching and quite lovely the shipment arrived very quickly the stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice but the clarity of the stone could be a little better however for the price it is an excellent ring and i would gladly give it as a gift	17
1	i bought this as a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter michelle she absolutely adored it she told me she only wears it to church and special occasions i loved the price	17
1	these earrings looked better than i expected they sparkle on my daughter 's ears very pretty	17
1	great kit for working with watches the tools were quite good quality and not flimsy and cheap the case was also good and thankfully was n't just the typical throw away plastic crap the inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place the case itself is firm black leather like material and snaps closed the kit contains a hammer band holding base and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins also includes the clamp type pin remover \( the blue thing \) a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs all in all i'm quite pleased with the product it was just what i wanted and was n't very expensive	17
1	these came in great condition and with a nice box to store them in ! they are very pretty but if you do n't like heavy earrings these wo n't be for you	17
1	this is a great ring for the price it is smooth low profile perfect size ring	17
1	i purchased this watch for my father as a gift the blue face is beautiful the numbers are easy to read it 's light weight and keeps perfect time he loves this watch and has had many compliments since he started wearing it	17
1	bought this as a gift for my brother he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he 's a tough person to buy something for	17
1	the keyring is very nice i had no idea just how light titanium is the caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight it 's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed making the ring kinda useless definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it additinally the metal is quite plyable and i 've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys	17
0	i 've had three of these watches but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on its ridiculus b c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore triathlons however the interval counter is a great feature but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two	17
0	i bought this watch for a gift overall the watch is nice but it does n't work properly we will have to send it to fossil for repair	17
0	waveceptor doesnt work properly it doesnt get in sync with new daylight savings and you dont even have a knob to manually correct it the watch i bought is just of no use to me now i would have to return it to casio for repair	17
0	watch is great looking but there was no battery in it now i have to get it to a jewlers to buy a battery there was no indication of this in the ad or in the instructions	17
0	the image really looks much better than the actual product stones are quite brownish not red as one would expect of garnet i would n't recommend anyone purchase this	17
0	i bought this for my daughter the display was dead when it arrived i took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery and the live battery let some display show but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used my daughter found a much cheaper watch at target with more features \( a stopwatch ! \) this one was n't even worth sending back	17
1	i am very pleased with my purchase the item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe recomended for reasonable prices	17
1	very pleased with this bracelet the crystals are gorgeous it is a wow bracelet	17
1	i like everything about this watch except the hands are hard to read in dim light because of the yellow background	17
1	i really love this watch it looks so nice and elegant shipping is supper fast only 2 days ! great deal many thanks	17
0	the color of the actually received ear rings was quite light a darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive since that showed a much darker colored amethyst i wo n't buy jewelry from amazon again when it comes to a colored stone hsn depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	17
1	this is a great watch the clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust it was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition well made and light it 's extremely slim so if you really like heavy watches this may not be your choice otherwise it is perfect for everyone	17
1	it 's a fantastic watch a little heavy and bit of work is required to adjust the band overall the nice blue background stands out quite nicely it 's on the money with keeping time too	17
1	i received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago and wear it everywhere but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain i average buying about 4 new chains a year since purchasing this chain my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links clothing fiber does n't catch on it my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp in short this is the worlds most perfect chain ! i cannot tell you how happy i am with this purchase	17
1	i was searching the web for weeks i saw thousands of watches and i did n't like them when i saw this watch that was it one of the most beautiful watches in the world i think design of this watch is superb very simple but astonishingly beautiful and original but there is one problem with this watch it can be purchased only in north america being from europe i had difficulties to get it	17
1	i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly	17
0	i bought a nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago the strap is already falling apart near the bezel the watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal even if the problem is poor workmanship	17
0	i did n't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before i purchased the watch this is disney and tinker bell ! the word flirt did n't bother me either because tinkerbell was a flirt wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band i was shocked that this watch is under the children 's section i needed this for my grand daughter 's birthday like it was said before i could have given this five stars but hot and saucy for a young girl oh no	17
1	if you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and do n't really have a good frame of referance these are for you my wife was a jewler and she likes pearls i bought these and got positive feedback i was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great you will be ok if you go with these	17
1	see all over for double the price works great get lots of compliments more the my more expensive watches	17
1	my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable	17
1	i bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for christmas the girls wear them all the time they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them	17
1	i was browsing through amazon when i came upon nvie jewelry and i absolutely love it ! i bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday but had a hard time not keeping it for myself the necklace was really nice well constructed and it was shipped quickly it looked just like the picture but i have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one of a kind i would recommend nvie designs to anyone for buying really lovely affordably priced jewelry	17
1	watch is a very sturdy and water resistant time piece however the resin band is very uncomfortable at times	17
1	i bought two of these \( one for each daughter 3 6 \) it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children thank you	17
1	this garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do keeps both my autos running and ready for use it is quiet smooth and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk it has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market it is well built and works as described	17
0	the good news is the watch 's case is quite nice now the could be improved points it 's sized weird it 's a lot larger than you think add to that it 's bracelet is rather small so now that i removed a single link i can barely get it over my average sized wrist and once it 's on it 's still too loose weird but true frankly it 's good looking but i do n't think i 'll get another one	17
1	i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews but they are for my two year old so i figured they really could n't be too small and they are not i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more and guess what the quality of theese is soooo much better all in all yes they are tiny but very cute and do n't lack detail ! will buy again	17
1	the watch was even more attractive than it appeared i had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews the mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands i am used to in low light it is sometimes difficult to see \( my eyesight is good \) but basically i am very satisfied	17
0	the watch came in a great looking case the face of the watch was attractive then oops could n't fasten it because there was no fastener it came with a return address slip for sending it back which is nice but i 'd rather get what i thought i ordered	17
1	i was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old but i got this for my daughter 's birthday and it fits her perfectly i was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things i 've bought from amazon lately but it 's actually a very cute well made cheap bracelet	17
1	my wife brought me this watch as a christmas gift i could not be more pleased nice big face and rugged decent quality i may just get the gold or black version next	17
1	i never had a problem with mine i'm a marine and the fact that i went trough combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks i paid for it i go trough watches like they are made of paper had this one for 2 5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine	17
1	i love this watch and i love the price it looks good both casual and dressy it goes with just about anything the people at invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such the material is high quality i have large wrists so it 's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff but it 's been loosening and so it 's much easier now	17
0	i bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch the v notched end was too thick to fit i used my pocket knife instead maybe there 's a knack to it but i did n't want to scratch my watch while practicing the pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small recessed auto set buttons for which a ball point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy but you probably have something around the house that would work just as well \( mini screwdriver the point of a phillips head	17
1	i'm logged in on my wife 's accont i never had problems with the band i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you 'll love it it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works	17
1	i love puzzle rings in england it 's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazo	17
1	i need this bracelet for someone heading for the military she would love it very much	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17
1	owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months it is still running like clock work would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one	17
1	i purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for christmas they are very pretty and they loved them the quality is good for price	17
0	please read mr marcus c dunn 's review because i agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings in my case i bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee when i first received it today i was really liked the design of the earring but after closer examination i noticed that the blue stone was very light blue good quality earring for a young teenager \( 9 to 14 years old \) but not for the woman i'm going to spend the rest of my life with returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson jewelry has to been seen and bought with your own eyes and not through fancy photoshop website with touchup enhanced photos	17
1	if your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a lego fan this is the best deal money can buy under 20 and is expandable etc probably not the most durable diver type watch you 'll ever buy but it is really good looking easy to assemble \( it 's a lego \) and all the kids think it 's neat to boot	17
1	these are gorgeous earrings that just happened to match a pendant i already had i 've had many compliments on them	17
1	these are very comfortable earrings i even sleep in them the hoops go with everything and i very seldom wear other earrings now	17
0	i had a watch like this from pulsar years ago and it worked well this one i am returning to amazon because it ca n't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to jan 1 it was made in china so what can i expect i am deeply disappointed in this product no more pulsars for m	17
0	i was hoping for a little bit higher quality but you get what you pay for i gues	17
1	this is the only watch my husband has worn to work for years we were happy to find it online and the price was good so we bought 2 of them	17
1	i am pleased with the watch it is flashy and keeps good time however i am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time i think i inadvertantly push a button that stops it it is a small annoyance but has happened 4 5 times in the last month	17
1	beautiful box to hold most of my watches have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings this box holds those watches in less space ! having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance ! another 10 in the drawer below if you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item	17
0	daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose	17
0	the product pretty much snapped in half while i was trying to remove two links from one watch the other one i tried before this one did n't fit in the adjustment piece at all so with that said do not buy this product at all it 's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use instructions are very unclear i ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed	17
1	as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture	17
1	i am 89 years old and i love this necklace ! whoever said old ladies can not wear fashion things are nuts ! i wear this with everything from my fridayy night bingo nights to clubing in l a with lindsey and pari	17
0	i got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests but none of the kids or i have been able to reset it my daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch the 2 little knobs ca n't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying instruction sheet needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use them then the purpose is defeated the service was great but the product is unsatisfactory phyllisunsatisfied custome	17
0	this pendant looks great in the picture but when i received it it looks like yellow glass does n't look like a crystal at all i'm very dissapointed	17
1	atomic watches are highly accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive u s atomic clock in ft collins colorado thus all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches casio makes and amazon sells a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes but all are equally accurate the casio g shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models such as this never require battery replacement atomic accurary solar power and g shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price	17
1	shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary but it arrived in very good condition nothing was damaged and the chain and little black pouch was well picked it was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend she expected just one item but this moon was well priced so i bought it with another pendant you are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price it is strong so no need to worry about breakage during shiping i like it and wish i could keep it but it was a gift	17
1	i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself it 's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40 below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire	17
1	i was very pleased with this purchase these earrings are very simple yet elegant they could be worn with jeans or to a more dressed up occasion a good choice for the price	17
1	this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping \( though i would n't call it sweeping \) i give it a 5 based on looks and cost i have n't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly \( it was losing a few hours at night \) i guess it just needed to get charged up it 's no rolex but it 's no casio either	17
1	i purchased this watch on amazon after looking at the same watch in jc penny and dillards for almost 200 00 more it 's a nice casual watch i wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive the mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it does n't clash when wearing other colors for the price seiko watches are great mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly	17
1	nice ring fast delivery i still need to check it out because my daughter says it does n't completely break down the way my old puzzle ring did	17
1	this pair of earrings is a great deal for the money you ca n't go wrong with a price like this	17
1	the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she 's used them for some time	17
1	i bought this watch to replace an older similar model it is simple and functional perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training	17
1	it is small and beautifull be sure you want a small one	17
1	great looking watch looks just like the photo if not better very pleased with the quality and for a very affordable price	17
1	could not have gotten a better deal it has been working for the last 2 months very quite i leave it in the bedroom ca n't beat the price recommended for those automatic watch lovers you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model	17
1	the charm is gorgeous any mother would love it from their husband or children but okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers	17
1	i bought this to save for a christmas gift it is a very nice looking piece of jewelry	17
1	this watch is attractive fairly heavy and well made \( esp for the price \) one small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up 4 1 2 stars	17
1	i bought this set for my wife as a valentine 's day gift she really liked them ! they are a good size and color so they give a striking impression from a distance the earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag if you purchase this as a gift go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation i went to wally world and bought a 3 wooden jewelry box which conveniently enough had a heart shaped decorative glass in the top it was well received	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
0	i like it but i do n't like box 's watch which obsolescence i hope my boy friend will love it	17
1	i got a really good deal for this watch and it looks great too very classy	17
0	these earrings are very pretty but the post is way too thick they killed my ears and i had to return them i would guess the post is at least 2 5 times as thick as a normal post and my ears did not like it ! ! !	17
0	earrings were very lightweight hollow and the hoops were very thin not good quality i could have done better at walmart i expected a lot better from amazon com especially for 50	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast	17
1	even if you are not buy this watch i am a nurse much like many of the other reviewers in fact i bought it due to their reviews it is a fantastic watch easy to read has an illumination option and a handy date feature the only trouble i have is the size of the band \( too long \) i will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out however the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy \( it 's not \) do n't even bother looking for another watch this one is a steal	17
1	this is so very handy you can adjust your own instead of dropping it off at a jeweler and waiting for it	17
1	i was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is it is a little smaller than i pictured but it is a nice non flashy watch i have n't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks so if you are looking for a subtle but cute watch this is for you but if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice i 'd look elsewhere	17
1	this is my third skagen watch the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons at less than 80 00 each they are a real bargin	17
1	the watch looks great prominent yet not overly large the orange really sets off the look the large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark i also like having both day and date complications and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than 300 \( way less on amazon \) is really a find you will need a pro to adjust the bracelet though as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler 's tools another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day overall i really like it it 's become my daily wear watch	17
0	for the price its not bad but as a watch you get what you pay for the band felt fake and the watch itself is too think for my taste i ended up returning the watc	17
1	this is a very pretty omega that goes well with many different pendants and looks great all by itself	17
0	having read the other reviews i expected something small but decent the particular pair i received had two defects 1 one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2 one of the stones had a very large visible black inclusion near the top it was visible to my naked eye \( i do n't have a jeweler 's loupe \) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts maybe i just got a bad pair but given those two problems and the small size of the stones i sent them back and did not try again	17
0	i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch however it never worked i do n't know if it had a dead battery or if it 's broken the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch i will try to resolve the issue with amazon	17
1	the watch was shipped in a timely manner actually i receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date i purchased this product as a gift for my son when i opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more my son and i am very pleased with the watch i do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man although this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches i took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect	17
1	i got these for 9 on the friday sale they are well made and the perfect size you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price wait for the friday sale if you can	17
1	very nice piece just beware of the size it 's much bigger than it appears in this picture it does hang nice on the silver cord however the clasp is backwards and with the cord it does not flex to the correct position	17
1	my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend 's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young \( or old \) girlfriend with an entry level nice gift they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance recommended	17
0	this watch did not last long in the water even though it said it was waterproof for 200 meters it lasted 2 weeks if you plan to purchase it for water look somewhere else	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it he has received many compliments it is high quality and arrived in perfect condition it is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well almost bought the watch at a dept store but saved 25 using amazon great product !	17
0	i chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo they felt quite flimsy when i got them i do like a lightweight earring but not a flimsy one the studs on these are not attached as firmly as i would like one has already come off they are however very pretty the quality was just not what i expected	17
1	wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you are n't going into the hole the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend i straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream also good lighting is a must	17
0	croton makes very superficial products they look good on the shelf but are very poorly constructed once you get them home they start to fall apart they have no customer service at all nobody answers the phone or returns email before buying a croton watch call their customer service you wo n't get through	17
1	i ordered one each for my 5 year old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine 's day nice pearl color and oval like shapes slightly too big for a 5 year old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult very dainty a great buy for the price	17
1	we sent this necklace to our daughter it arrived actually earlier than anticipated and she just loves it what a great company to deal wit	17
1	i just bought this ring it is really beautiful it is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly it was a really good buy	17
1	the item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described no problems whatsoever	17
1	got this ring last christmas for my wife it still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is she gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it	17
1	this ring is beauriful and eye catching i unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded and despite that the ring remains beautiful	17
1	i got this for my mother at christmas and she loved it you ca n't help but notice the pendant when she has it on very beautiful design sleek and stylish she gets compliments everytime she wears it even though this was just an extra gift i think it turned out to be one of her favorite things	17
1	bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b day she loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them	17
1	this is a fun item to own i spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet i think a solution should be included with the item	17
1	i wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son and came upon this ring when it arrived i really was in awe of just how beautiful it is ! it is a larger more bold ring definitely more masculine this is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love it 's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12 hopefully i can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice	17
1	paid 45 for these and worth every penny they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself	17
1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
1	i really like the watch it looks good feels good on my wrist and keeps extremely accurate time \( gains about 4 sec per month \) the price of at amazon com was very good compared to others i found in local stores or on the web	17
1	these earrings are beautifully made look great when put on and come at a great price all these ingredients make a stunning value i am a very pleased customer	17
0	i really liked the watch as it looked in the picture but when i purchased it i realized that its way too shiny if you have a thin wrist then the watch looks really bulky besides the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north so you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time i am going to return this watch	17
1	great deal and gift if you want something different and at a good price	17
1	the facets make the chain quite sparkly i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains	17
0	this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases	17
0	my 5 year old daughter was thrilled with her locket it is really beautiful we were both quite disappointed however when the locket itself broke the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off she is a normal kid but was not overly rough with the necklace it is currently at the jeweler 's to be fixed	17
1	someone near and dear to me loved it and the price was right ! valentine 's day is coming it makes a great gift	17
1	this pin is n't as pretty in person as it is in the picture online it is nice but not spectacular	17
1	everyone loves this watch i wear it for work and it 's sleek enough to look sharp women constantly compliment me on how it looks	17
1	my 26 yr old son got this for his birthday he loved it and wears at always	17
1	i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me cute though	17
0	the picture showed is about 3x magnification the diamonds are tiny and it looks very cheap i will be returning this necklace	17
0	this looked great when it came but broke in only one day really poor craftmanship	17
0	i 've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped so the crown no longer locks in place i 've tried contacting citizen for waranty and they say it 's not covered citizen claims that i over tightened it or cross threaded it while screwing down so it will cost 50 100 to repair total joke ! i 'll never purchase a citizen watch again i 've always thought they were cheap to begin with this just confirms my thoughts	17
1	i do n't know for whom watchebands are sized perhaps the incredible hulk in his green phase \? all i know is i'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band the climate my activities this procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands this complete kit does the trick a couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and i'm done could n't get much simpler i finally got this kit after wrestling with a new fossil band that would not cooperate used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice wish i had it years ago	17
1	i bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace i had seen at the smithsonian institute i love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi strands of this design this combination truly illuminates my evening wear by far the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court with so much class it is still affordable this necklace is an exceptional gem	17
1	the band and face are both so much darker than they look in the picture also amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information \( i had to contact skagen for this \) the watch is very attractive though	17
0	i wouold only skim this book if you want a general idea about business marketing but do not expect in depth detail about how to truly market your business	18
0	the content of this book is adequate but the layout leaves much to be desired the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents pages are not labeled with chapter information such as which chapter that page belongs to the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book i would rate it much higher	18
1	this is a great book well written and illustrated this is one of the most hilarious children 's books i 've read to my child we were laughing throughout the whole thing i highly recommend this book to both children and adults	18
1	this book covers the entire state in one easy to carry book whether you 're looking for romantic bed and breakfasts in the wine country the hippest restaurant in san francisco or the best beaches in la and san diego this book is all you 'll need it covers hotels ranging from a beach front motel in santa monica to the best places to stay in yosemite 's camp grounds	18
0	the information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids it is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem	18
0	i ordered the book from them on nov1 on nov 15 i called and they told me they did n't have it the money was returned by amazon	18
0	talk about self absorbed i guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business i thought the man made some good points but few are helpful to anyone in the real world \( or outside the newspaper business \) nausea sets in after the second chapter neuharth will die an old lonely rich man respected by many hated by nearly all luckily i did n't have to sit through this entire book i put it down quickly	18
1	though no book will make you a filmmaker some will help you refine your vision this book for me added some poetry and texture to the imagery already in my mind pretty much the only thing that will improve your film skills is making them	18
1	practical sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it 's extremely dry the author 's writing is much more engaging in his followup and that 's a much faster read in addition to offering some practical tips the millionaire next door also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry 's money secrets a book called maybe life 's just not that into you and something from andy borowitz the name of which escapes me if you have to choose between the millionaire next door and the millionaire mind go with the latter	18
0	yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you 'll like it if you 're like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer ! i'm really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds do n't waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb	18
1	i used this book as a student and still use it for teaching pieces are nice and students are challenged to think musically it moves quicker than some other method books it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate upon completion of the first grade book students can play standard repertoire in the early intermediate level students must have completed early elementary level before using this book because this book starts with playing two hands in c position emphasize phrasing from the first piece highly recommended	18
1	the man of her dreams the woman of his ! is a book that is critically necessary today in light of our divorce culture sadly it equally affects christians the sames as non christians joel pulls no punches in assigning the blame to men 's arrogance and poor exploitive biblical exegesis the back and forth style communicates the same cooperation and give and take necessary for successful marriages this book is must read for the engaged newlyweds and those struggling to stay together all cliches aside this is a must read rodrick burtonauthor the moral state of black america	18
0	this book is similar to going to a poor movie sequel there is nothing new and it bores you with percentages the title and cover are the best aspects of the book once you open it and begin reading it quickly goes downhill save your money i wish i had	18
1	this book has come in handy several times it is especially useful for writing informed consents and for creating many of the documents you do n't realize you need until it is too late	18
0	i bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school they did not like the narrator 's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words this is a great cd for high school or adults but not children a bust for us	18
1	beautiful stunning absolutely gorgeous a quick note to fellow brits this was ordered on october 22nd and arrived on november 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon co uk or anywhere else in the uk ! ! i 've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post ! !	18
1	it helped me place myself in the right direction as far as choosing a college it 's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before visitng a college i would reccomand this book the software was useful to me however if you know how to write a formal essay it 's no big deal	18
1	it is in my opinion the second best anne book ! its anne 's wedding ! the whole thing is soaked in romance ! leslie 's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her captain jim is so sweet and perfect you can nearly see him miss cornelia is funny and susan is great anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful the only thing i do n't like is that i wish marrilla and all the avonlea people would be in it a little more in my opinion this should be where the series ends	18
1	i enjoyed this book for the most part i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the quot mountain quot the main characters were all there participating in the problem solving there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode and some food for thought added in as well is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there \? i do n't know but this book presents some interesting questions i await the next book in the series	18
0	i did n't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived having now wasted a weekend reading this book i have to agree with everyone the topic sounds great the book is n't	18
0	i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives all we had at the ending was ashes also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending	18
1	this is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time it 's finally here and it 's outstanding ! now when i take apart an owl pellet i 'll be able to determine what the owl was eating and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area and when i'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal bird amphibian or reptile i 'll be able to find what that is too mark elbrock has done it again an instant classic and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection	18
0	this dictionary is just another long winded pretentious unreadable high brow attempt to legitimize anthropology the authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology if you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions forget this book	18
0	i really feel stupid about ordering this book why did i do it \? the story is that stacey is moving back to new york	18

1	how many times have i wished dr dolittle could come visit me and just talk to my 16 year old curmudgeon and have rambo pass along what 's got him yelling all night twisted whiskers is the next best thing pam johnson discusses a wide variety of feline behavior problems in cats' terms so we can form better human feline cohabitation her chapters on old age and depression were indispensible in dealing with rambo in addition johnson talks about natural remedies rather than having us end up with a generation of doped up furbabies johnson lists the bach 's flower remedies and their appropriate applications and doseages for felines excellent read ! highly recommended for new and old time cat companions	18
1	i like this author 's work so much that i actually bought the hard cover since i could n't wait for the pb to be issued however p d james' view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times \( a contrast to her autobiography \) in this one there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living never really feeling any joy or often even happiness however when adam and emma come together at the end there was a ray of hope please ms james give us a new book asap	18
0	this has to be one of the worst written books i ever read i ca n't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing so far danielle steel has found a way in the first third of this book i just ca n't read the rest of it generally if a book is n't very good i can suffer through this one has gotten on my last nerve i had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable but i do n't think i will be reading anymore of her books it 's an insult to nora roberts and sandra brown for her to be ranked with them	18
0	i love other preston childs books so i thought i would love this one i did n't it is completely predictable i was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists but there were none and parts of it were ridiculous the length of the entombment the amount of the treasure the manner of transport etc the only character i really liked was the monkey	18
1	the product was in excellent condition and the shipping was the fastest i have seen to be from regular postal service it got here less than a week	18
1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival the author obviously knows his stuff what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published i'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j l bourne a deal he 's good	18
1	this was perhaps the best of johannes steinhoff 's books since it does not deal with his own stellar yet tragic ww ii and post war career the insights of the average person living in germany are of great importance to both social and military historians alike steinhoff offered this collective testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise of a dictator as johannes said in an interview quot it is always the civilians who suffer the most yet are remembered the least quot	18
1	i was very impressed to find this very nice book i 've heard about a quebecois who painted for the popular singer celine dion \( i'm from quebec canada myself \) i wanted to see and i'm very proud of it huge ceilings and wonderful murals ! wow felicitations	18
0	this is one of the dullest chick lit derivatives of the ya ya sisterhood and their adventures or misadventures it is full of misery poorly developed characters and is so formulaic that i predicted the outcome after about 50 pages at which point i could no longer stomach these ego driven falsely sweet dolts do n't waste your money	18
0	i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training including the different levels snd sub levels i would have bought a manual i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing i got neither the characters were neither likeable nor substantive except for the cop next door i have no idea what they even look like or what if anything they care about besides dogs the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear maybe the series inmproves after this book i'm not taking that chance	18
1	i really did enjoy reading this book cover to cover it 's very touching and very informative it will change your ideas about a lot of things the writer along with other expert contributors have done a great job bringing out all of these real moving stories i would recommend this book for every human being who cares about other fellow human beings	18
0	this book disappointed me after reading martins letters although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez	18
1	you will never look at these birds the same again fansinating	18
0	very disappointing as well as boring ! ! generalities of little help have seen simple cheap books with better ideas and tips the writer might be a grandmaster but this will not help othercreatures forget about this book	18

1	this book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in colonial america how they played what their education was like what they wore etc the information is drawn from such primary sources as letters journals and school primers there are a number of pictures as well i recommend it	18
1	i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer is that logical at all \? \? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father \? if he had the senator when he was twenty he 'd have to be 77 is it really reasonable that he 's running around killing people and setting houses on fire it was a very unlikely twist to the end it still was a good book	18
1	the snow goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read set on the coast of england at the time of dunkirk it is less about the strife of wwii itself than about its three main characters one of whom is the snow goose and what binds them it is a story about nature love and nobility of spirit to say more would be to give too much away but it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades and i reread it when i need to be reminded what is important in life	18
1	being a flight attendant myself and looking through the skymall magazine countless times on long flights i can tell you this book is amazing i have never laughed so hard from a book all my life i really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge i'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it	18
1	what if you 're a runaway secret agent really really really tired of the war then some geek tells you he 's found a genuine martian artifact leading to a spaceship what would you do \? annoyingly as you set out to recover the spaceship there 's just a little bit of sabotage and there 's the war still and then there 's the spaceship and you uncover something of why the martians have abandoned space as you know it it 's takeshi taking the lead uncovering a big secret trying to find a way out of war only to discover there 's been little change since the martians left no change really there 's still a war	18
0	flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking	18
1	amazing one or probably the most impressive paintor 's book i have not easy subjects sometimes but anyway always beautiful	18
0	i love the number one detective agency series and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales unfortunately there was no narrative flow making the stories stilted and un interesting maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped i suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable	18
0	mr haqqani 's views about his mother country are very dubious the only question i have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner what has he done for his home land \? nothing ! ! ! this book in waste of time	18
1	halfway through it and it is very good concerning the difficulties that physicians who are married or in a serious relationships face thoughout their careers a good read for those entering the profession and a must read for those recently married	18
0	maybe it was me but i kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and i had to put it down it was almost aggravating	18
1	simply clearly written the book is a very practical guide for someone new to but serious about farming concise yet still comprehensive and fun to read would have liked a section on draft animals but schwenke 's disclaimer for not including it makes sense	18

0	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature it is timely but it is not timeless not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly not one scene is memorable the true nature of the book soap opera is cloaked under its many pages messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story and she seems to have believed her publicity machine i ca n't believe that her husband who a great literary critic would not talk her out of publishing this oh i forgot money and fame trumps quality every time	18
1	wow this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma not just about cards but also contains business etiquette marketing tips and techniques and \( un \) common sense wish i had read it 20 years ago required reading for pretty much anybody who has to go out into the world and deal with another person	18

0	very seldom do i give up on a book i gave up on this one after several attempts to finish i have read barbara delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books i remember the fascination with the peyton place grace metalious hoopla in the 50 's and 60 's so i was expecting to enjoy this story it is dull and tiresome	18
0	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far but secrets was a big disappointment to me as far as i am concerned ms steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins \( some explicit parts i didn`t like at all \) simply not the danielle steel we like the story itselfs is ok \( gives the readers some insights behind the scenes of hollywood \) but some of her books i`ve read over and over again i am not going to touch secrets for a second time however	18
1	i loved this book it talked about every facet of the stock market but did n't go overboard with jargon i knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book i am ready to learn more it was well written interesting and unlike some investing books the author was not trying to sell anything this is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest but has no knowledge of the subject i really enjoyed this book	18
0	at first glance this is a great book however once you 've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children 's books as well \? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however	18
0	18 jun 2005as the book progressed it got more and more egoistic to the point where it becomes a turn off towards the end of the book i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem shaq 's attitude seems to be that since he can score he does not respect centers who ca n't score whereas he respect bill russell but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq so this is a big improvement	18
1	to learn some italian before visiting italy i tried multiple language learning programs borrowed from my local library some were ridiculous many required using a workbook then i stumbled on the pimsleur program which is totally audio allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work due to the pedagogically sound method pimsleur developed for language learning i actually did learn some basic italian as a result i bought conversational italian though i 've never considered myself adept at language learning i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds i 've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language	18
1	this book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers former underachievers and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself i was compelled to write my own review no one blames parents especially dr rathvon they do the best they can with what they 've got mental resources specifically this book is for anyone who knows that their child is capable of so much more it is never too late to fix polish and fine tune a learning mind every student has the ability to achieve	18
0	the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i do n't know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children 's librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying	18
0	the author had a great idea but he cherry picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b c it 's destroyed etc etc i'm not critiscizing this book b c it has a religious message i'm critiscizing it b c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is just a comic superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america	18
0	i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations \( in detail \) of people having sex the book is probably very good if you like reading text books and do n't mind these pictures but i was just too grossed out if you are teaching lit in college and or studying shakespeare this is probably the book that you should use but you should flip through the book first \( i e library book store \) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves	18
0	ok i havent read it yet and it will take some effort to do so the pages are yellowed they are cut uneven \( a first for me to witness ! ! \) i have ordered 3 books on chinese issues and 2 have been scams ok there 's a lesson there somewhere buyer beware especially concerning chinese items ! ! ! their economic strategy revolves around begins with cheap materials ! buyer beware	18
0	i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between quot wicca quot and quot witchcraft quot wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to quot chopping quot of source materials this is a waste of money	18
1	when tom returns w huck jim from thier crazy escapeds in huckleberry finn he 's the center of fame but when it wears off tom begins to hanker for a new adventure he found it all right trapped in a runaway balloon w a mad sceintist who wants to commit a glorious suicide is n't my idea of a leisurely summer vacation but it gets pretty funny	18

0	suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic to refer to rabbi david berger 's book the rebbe the messiah amp the scandal of orthodox indifference	18
0	i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times	18

1	perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in english \( or at least it appears to have been there is no translator listed \) but this is by far the most lucid thing i 've read by latour in a way it 's a radical break he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child actor network theory stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work	18

0	while this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot the mistakes are inexcusable many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data therefore one begins to lose trust in the information presented be careful if you use this book	18
1	this was an inspiring book for a horse lover and christian everything was as advertised	18
0	i did n't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are i am disappointed that the notes are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation rather key terms are defined and that is all	18
1	this book was a life saver for me as i opened my solo practice this summer without it i would have spent countless hours developing these forms myself the feature that allows you to customize the forms is especially nice i recommend this for new or veteran mental health workers	18
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	18
1	consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan calvino 's fiction is sui generis a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory oriented if on a winter 's night a traveler this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination invisible cities is also i am convinced a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary dream city of venice a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea	18
0	i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women men are to rule and women are to submit to that rule the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read discovering biblical equality it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women	18
0	as a student of urban development and politics i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that by employing simply economic analysis does not allow for the intricacies of the city 's problems class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel	18
0	if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman 's self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student	18
1	this is the first book i have read from this author i am truly amazed at how well i enjoyed his style it kind of reminded me of some of the good stuart woods books i have read i plan on reading many more from michael connelly great read you wo n't be disappointed trust me	18

1	almost everyone you meet is having trouble with a relationship this book by charles swindoll is a wonderful tool to assist people to build better relationships from my own person experience i have come to conclude that the larger part of relationship problems are caused by lack of communacation in this book charles talks about how to be open in a relationship and the value of trust not only in a personal relationship but also in the church a wonderful must read	18

0	book contains many useful lists charts comparisons to define giftedness many helpful hints about raising a gifted child main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general and may push those with quot normal quot kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track when they should not gifted kids are the exception not the norm as this book makes it seem	18
0	after anticipating the arrival of this book \( that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it \) i was disappointed although the subject is timely the writing style smacks of academia and therefore will not appeal to the mainstream \( reader \) because i'm tenacious by nature i finished the book but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention too bad it could have been inspirational	18
1	great heartwarming stories about a boy 2 owls and a dog i recommend this for all ages the cover markets this as a childrens 's book but adults who like animals will love this story too a bird lovers' delight	18
0	this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb however its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo intellectualizations it should be noted that this book was not written by hale it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale 's classic drawing lessons from the great masters instead this book loses itself in unimportant erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle confuse frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory	18
1	this book shows in detail how much of the media has gone out of its way to attack the president and how many facts have been distorted in the process it also provides a rare look at what the president really does with his time and how much effort he puts into his work if you are looking for a book that labels president bush as a liar or a dummy this is not the book for you but it is a superb look at the events of the last year and a half including the election of 2004 do n't be narrow minded i highly recommend it	18
1	with beautiful photos of the range of niki 's work this children 's book enables both kids and adults to get an overview of niki 's work especially her sculptures this is the only book i have found that has pictures of her escondido work it is a magical place and one can get a feel for it through this book	18
1	i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run down community is a classic of american literature what this book and o'connor 's other novel the last hurrah apart is the writing in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man o'connor wrote very well and his language is beautiful from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all	18

1	that about says it all bill bryson is a hilarious writer i like reading grammar books anyway but i was always excited to read this book as it 's so entertaining besides that it can teach \( or remind \) you of a lot of good rules of writing the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary and some necessary entries are left out	18

0	this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family 's experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction	18

0	mcmurry 's text is a very friendly gentle intro to organic it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read but it does n't teach you what you need to know explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief and the problems included are usually very basic and general \( the spectroscopy and synthesis problems in particular \) if you 're looking to become a chemist this is not the book to learn from i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook or any number of sophomore level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully \( i e on exams or out in the industry \)	18

0	i bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me however the information provided is too extensive and confusing listing far too many points in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them the body map listing them is in the first part of the book so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to i also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous the way this system originated is also a little murky this is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public	18
1	this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre christian origins of the marian cult other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so called quot bvm quot the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church	18

0	obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed	18

0	some photographers think what 's erotic is what 's hidden and left to the imagination two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing leaving plenty to the imagination think of playboy magazine in the 1950 's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today many of these are stylistic but not very erotic one in three of the photos in the book are erotic not afraid of nudity do n't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism instead get shaven angels natural beauties 100 naked girls or crazy sexy girls	18

1	although the photographs are dated the material is classic this book is a must for anyone who is involved with design or review of open spaces it shows how people use open space and identifies the common elements of successful spaces while the elements all seem logical the book shows how we often fly in the face of logic when using these spaces the book focuses primarily on plazas and small parks in new york city but includes a section for smaller cities with low rise buildings the information can also be applied to parks in any size town this book is a facinating case study in social ecology	18

1	angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5 star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman she focuses entirely on the black power movement in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves	18

0	this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is \( there is n't a single clue at any point in time \) the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you do n't even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine \( since she ca n't even remember much about herself much less him \) if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard	18

1	this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns from the get go to contemporary times has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride or as a reference source reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount it 's instructive to read the history of grover cleveland who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates like clinton he had his scandals fathering an illegitimate child like gore his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost in a hotly contested knife edge electoral college tally	18

0	i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it 's an autobiography i do n't necessarily think that it 's fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it 's an okay addition to one 's list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i 've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i would n't however use it as my primary source for information or impressions	18

1	this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either	18

0	this book is a cure for insomnia if i ever have trouble falling to sleep i 'll just dig out my old flatland book and i 'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later ! listening to the a square character telling us about his flat two dimensional world is not thought provoking its just confusing ! trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing i mean i understand what flatland would be like but only after i carefully think out what mr square is saying i spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of flatland than i do enjoying the story not very interesting at all even two stars is being generous	18

1	this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form political arm and unloving attitude this book is a real insight into the christian faith of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals especially those who were not self righteous but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives	18

1	it opens with a tribute to h g wells and ends with an homage to jules verne in the middle are 18 more stories that span from side to side of the sf spectrum and even though they might not be all in the reader 's preferences are sure worth reading if not thought provoking talking about preferences i ca n't help mentioning terry bisson 's quot in the upper room quot and damon knight 's quot life edit quot as the best of the lot look forward for number 3 and 4 and	18

1	in the beginnig of the 1930 's the turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the armenian genocide that took place in 1915 16 turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the us government in 1933 though when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book so the then us government again put pressure on mgm not to make this movie a foreign government coerced censorship in the unites states just imagine that ! i hope the the making of the movie	18

0	his fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow there is some wisdom here and there but not worth the headache you 'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head here is an example if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment it will seem utterly alien you will then understand the sacrament of baptism huh \? at first i thought his writing may just be over my head but after re reading most of it i realized it was just bad it 's like the whole book was written when he was high or something some very good ideas but most can be found in other better written books	18

0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	18

0	this book looks like it was written by someone who works in their own garage as a hobby there is no real technical data in this book no hint of professionalism the photos are black and white and most of the time they do n't really show what the book is talking about there are no torque specs little detail or warnings on how things are done with the quality of this book you 're better off saving the 30 and pulling the jeep apart yourself to see how it works	18
1	i felt that the book was basically the same as the previous edition with the exception of aromatherapy and electric filing unfortionatly no one book can give all of the information that is required about a subject that is what teaching is all about i generally supplement the material from other books and florida law so our students stay on the right path over all i would have to say that this book was above average and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date	18
0	this book is a sure snooze fest luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class we read selected chapters of the book they writing was horrible many parts were unclear i had to reread what i read over and over i ca n't stand this style of writing barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent instead he comes off as boring and pretentious skip this book try something else	18
0	while it 's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone	18
1	i read les miserables after i saw the opera and it has inspired in me more than any book i 've ever read i do n't believe one could ever find a better novel anywhere for everyone out there read this now ! ! there is a character that will touch everyone no matter what type of person you are this novel is easy to relate to and exciting it also give some insight to the unwritten history of the revolutions in france during napolean 's time i recommend strongly to everyone to read this book and see the opera it really will effect your life	18

0	i have yet to read this book however so far the average rating is quite suspicious each one of the three reviewers does not have a single other review in their profile i am at the stage where i am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading so i would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book to do everyone of the rest of us a favor and post an honest review please we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w the author or his publisher	18
1	i have n't completed the book yet but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable it begins in genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections he ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day i always look for to the next reading	18

1	this book melded two things i never thought i 'd see in one book the salem witch trials and modern drug research sounds a little weird at first but robin cook makes it work alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century salem ma make this a very engaging read as with other books by robin cook none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to no matter how rich smart etc they may be great read ! very exciting endin	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18
1	i read this book on vacation many years ago i read quot in the shoes of the fisherman quot and quot the clowns of god quot i enjoyed both of these books but not enought to search out and read the third book in the trilogy what a mistake ! this book contains the politics of power the behind the scenes strugles and the fears and doubts as well as the faith and triumphs of the servants of the vatican as well as the italian and international scene the relationships both formed forming and parting kept me glued to the book the pace was fast and enthralling do not miss this book the end was somewhat predictable but never the less still shocking	18
0	rosalind krauss' theories have some merits and if you are looking at a book that will drive you up the wall the entire time shouting at it read this i would never allow my grad students to read this dribble	18
0	cruel horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot the abuse of children evil ranger poising as a dead ranger freaky religious sect dead animals on the bed and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me i 've read many barr books and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters it 's hard to keep them straight in this book that was the last of my worries i did n't even finish it i was so turned off	18
1	along with from science to god mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work it has the same hopeful message and the same readability in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo even when discussing very complicated subjects that is n't a statement on his intelligence or research but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings in short everyone can sit around his table \( well almost everyone \) read'em twice	18

0	i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i 've ever read it was n't about the crimes it was about this author 's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she was n't she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that was n't what this book was about again it was n't worth the i actually threw my copy of this away	18

0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
1	charles h kahn 's account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion although less than 200 pages long is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality in a concise but intelligent summary kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn 's treatment \( or lack of \) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought but this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language	18
0	i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i 'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals	18
0	though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it 's the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction	18
0	camenson definitely has experience in this career with many quot career books quot to her credit however there are better books out there on writing with more information this book follows the same old tired format that vgm books are 'not so' famous for the internet has more info for a lot less money	18
1	ever since starting on the simple abundance journey with sarah ban breathnach 's first book i have longed for an opportunity to learn one on one from the queen of simplicity and authenticity we may not be able to meet sarah face to face but now anyone can enjoy a workshop atmosphere in the comfort of her own home women caught up in the day to day deluge of deadlines appointments and commitments can now curl up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self i highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur	18

0	this is for beginners it 's filled with useless forms and it provides very little information beyond a common sense and reasoned approach to real estate surely there must be better resources than this	18
1	i bought this book just recently and was really touched \( and cried \) by the whole experience that gus had went through he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance \( stephanie \) and without her he could 've been out there on the street again overall it 's a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another this book is a genuine prove	18
0	two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman 's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city	18
0	this book is very dissapointing sure this book is full of information but does not know how to teach this book is not completely written in step by step method before you actually start touch your project you are fed up with information i even found a couple of mistakes in earlier chapter dvd comes with this book but this dvd is not a lesson project like apple pro training series not useful if you are beginner and start studying dvd studio pro 4 do n't by this book ! you 're going to waste your money buy the one from apple pro training series which is much better easy to understand	18
1	i read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class and then i read it again and enjoyed it both times de wall does protest too much he 's clearly answering his critics throughout but i found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing more importantly de wall 's arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive \( not that i needed much persuading \) and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining i'm looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days	18
0	i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series this is by far the worse i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like but this work truly deserves a bad word it is not about shakespeare but rather about germaine greer she simply did not do the assignment that she was given	18
0	american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	18
0	i found this book to be very disappointing ms conant and her heroine were both suffering from memory loss with this book not up to her usual standard	18

1	elaine pagels is a wonderful writer her explanation into early christianity is wonderful it is definitely worth the time to read this she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this	18
1	tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts webs and walls states v markets v individuals and the comprehensive failure of the arab street leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day are extremely well thought out from reading this compilation of nyt columns i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best selling book 'the world is flat ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions his ability to see the big picture is spot on	18
1	tolstoy 's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing his writing is so personal and open that i do n't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved i was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active god in the conclusion of his search	18

1	i love readding calvin and hobbes best cartoon from the newspaper and great books what a great imagination the writer is	18
0	this book is for the diehard dave navarro fans only the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative the text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist neil straus approached writing the dirt with motley crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested this book falls short unless i would have been inclined to want to see things dave 's way i grew restless of this pretty quickly	18
1	this book is beautifully constructed concise gracefully written and should be of immense help to most golfers if you 've read ernest jones percy boomer or jimmy ballard \( for example \) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing try the keys you will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game my swing improved markedly after i came to understand author mcteigue 's lighthouse turn \( lesson two momentum \)	18
1	house poor identifies the key issues consumers need to know to survive the current volatile housing market the style is brisk and understandable and the information is focused and useful unlike books that try to entice readers with promises of getting rich quick by investing in real estate house poor gives suggestions about how to invest prudently and warns readers about the dangers of becoming overextended when activity in many housing markets begins to decline from its current unsustainable level many people will wish they had read the advice in fletcher 's book	18
1	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy although the book is considered an educational read i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well it 's just an interesting book it doesnt get much simpler than that	18

1	after reading several reviews on this unit we purchased it the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to get in the game it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it all i can say is wow ! the performance is phenomenal we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works i cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid highly recommended	19

1	unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated this product stands in nearly every aspect the sleek supreme design by f a porsche makes this product appearance timeless and its preformance is outstanding more effective in this model than its smaller slower \( 80gb 120 gb \) counterparts the autostart is a little slow for me \( its the usb model not firewire remeber \) but is a totally acceptable feature for the price design performance cost benefit equilibrium excellent purchase	19
0	purchased for my daughter an english teacher scrabble lover she said she 'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she 'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game she said it would end up on a shelf in her house she 'd rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary i returned the franklin she did n't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class	19

0	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges if any of them is out of ink you ca n't print at all if you 're out of yellow ink you still cannot print a purely black white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that	19
1	radio shack wanted 39 95 for a similar item so at 9 95 this was a steal swr is good and performance is as much as i need for corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what i need i did have to put a metal plate on the vette \( discreetly \) as it would n't stick to the fiberglass good produc	19

0	if these were free i 'd still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings it is the discs i must assume since my burner works fine with other brands anyway \( now \) i think it 's best to invest a bit more and get good media	19
0	i 've had these speakers for three years now hissing popping not holding signal all that has been true from day 1 and tonight one of the speakers just would not turn on the power supply was n't the problem it 's something inside the speaker box and something that apparently cannot be fixed so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution oh well	19

1	overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again	19

0	i bought one of these about 3 days ago and it 's already broken i try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda not only that but it drains rather than charges the battery this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk you 'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you 're trying to charge into one smart phone pda whatever that does everything you want	19
0	i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod \( one fewer thing to carry \) well about six months after opening this item i noticed that my ipod was running on battery one of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore i am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 i spent	19
0	i bought the kx tg5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it 'spredecessor kx tg5471 the 5571 handset does not have a flash button ! what you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button wait foroptions to appear on the screen and then press a different button toaccess the flash function and there is no way to figure that out whilelooking at the handset why	19
1	not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff	19
0	installation express install is over 200mb full install about 650mb ! ! ! it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer 6 to continue installation \( how it this related to printer installation and what if i do n't use internet explorer i do not \) install takes forever is memory hog then tries to sign you up for some services i used to like hp printers i'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software	19
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player but after the first week the earphone input \( hole in the player \) did n't hold the input jack securely resulting in no sound i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second but could not get it to work continuously unfortunately i threw away my receipt and box or i would return it	19

1	this memory card has not given us any trouble very reliable product highly recommend	19
1	everything about the sonos worked as advertised it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated the interface is commonsense and well thought out it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously you can also play different music all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises	19
1	this bag is very good the outside phone jack is a plus the only negative hard to access the other dvd 's when in use	19
1	theis is a small manuverable mouse i especially like it for playing games since it is very quick i had one before and i would buy another if this one quits	19
0	the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks	19
0	i bought this phone for the great features and because i 've had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i ca n't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them	19
1	for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i 'll say is that m audio 's tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \)	19

1	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit given our power failures brown out and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job i have not only my desktop pc but my scanner printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures	19
0	hard to believe this product is still being sold when it 's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it wo n't be long until they 're shaking this may influence what music you 'll end up playing through the system all said though i 'd be happy with it for the price if only they 'd update it to fully handle my ipod	19

1	i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that was n't too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it 's not terribly sturdy maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it 's in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too	19
1	this product is fantastic great sound with a small footprint i purchased a jbl on stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days the cta product has been great and it cost a lot less than the jbl product	19
1	i do all my burning on a standard windows media player and it 's almost entirely data and music no video for my purposes these cd 's sound great in some cases it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but nevertheless i'm a big fan of the memorex and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price recommended	19
1	i needed this cable to use with my garmin rino 120 because my new laptop did n't have a serial adapter my first try was to use a similiar product from radio shack but i found the radio shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable i ordered the cp technologie product from amazon and it worked great ! also the cp tech product was less than half the cost of the radio shack product \( including shipping \)	19

1	i bought this sd card and took some 100 snaps out of it the card is really fast with my canon a510 camera reading takes a slightly longer time than writing i would recommend this card to anyone actually this card outperforms the 16mb mmc supplied with the camera also the 256mb card will hold upto 200 \( may be lesser \) 3 2mp pictures	19

0	the sony mdr if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you 're like me a mere adult mortal they probably wo n't fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you 're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money	19
1	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight but certainly bright enough no battery feature ca n't be beat manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind i 've never left mine on that long but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year this is an excellent flashlight i 've bought several	19
0	no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i didconfirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie	19
1	i agree that these are not top of the line but they are n't bad at all i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for 2x in this case it takes longer but i get good results i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd i would buy these again updated on 7 3 2005 i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what so ever very happy with this product	19

0	after less than one week of use i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection in 5 days i have had to cycle power on this unit on average more than once per day after it locks up the web ui fails to respond to connection requests it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power i have tried to work with netgear technical support but their suggestions \( e g lower mtu \) have been useless and their responses quite tardy if you are looking for a firewall vpn unit i suggest you pass on this particular product	19

0	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p o s ! !	19
0	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	19
0	i wish i had read the problems and netgear com forums before purchasing this product huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers second problem i am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 3 5feet from the ap the unit is around 11 36mpbs do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke latest firmware fixes none of the problems	19
0	i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming and its response time did deliver it is more precise in it 's cursor control than any other mouse i 've used however it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me i find it 's side buttons are difficult to use they 're very small and their action is not to my liking further i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons i 've found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date	19
1	opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone	19

0	this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)	19

0	the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine	19

1	i purchase this on amazon for 499 no tax free shipping you can not match this quality at this price the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color i looked at samsung for 800 and i am glad i saved myself 300 with this lcd	19

1	i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago so far so good it interfaces very easily with the computer though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit \( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs \) it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane you may need some noise canceling headphones	19

0	item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53	19
1	i bought this for my wife i have an iriver hp120 which i consider to be one of the best ever made i have to say i think this is a great little player the interface is well designed the unit is well made and the sound quality is excellent i purchased a u2 about 1 year ago as a gift which was also excellent i think cowon is making some of the better mp3 players on the market now and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit	19
1	i recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required i did n't know that i would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board that 's ok i was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit	19
1	this is my second iriver product the first one was fine but it could n't survive a trip through the washing machine this one works well is easy to navigate through good sound the case is rather cheap the other one was rigid plastic this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order all in all this is a great little mp3 player	19
1	the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long i researched dockable ipod mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife 's office i'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment the i grove does not disappoint it provides room filling sound with no distorion i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on it delivered another bonus with the klipsch is it 's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and or personal compact disc players i'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i groove	19
1	we 've only had ours a week and i wish we 'd bought it sooner the photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones i like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big hp printer 's photos which stay sticky for some time having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters to use in scrapbooking and to frame for your home or for gifts really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop	19
1	buying from amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping stepped up for more power per channel stayed in the sony family \( previous sony surround output to center speaker quit \) dislike the speaker hook ups in back difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections overall happy with purchase	19
0	this thing is a piece of junk it stops working in between of a song for no reason u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much	19
0	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine \? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company	19
1	i use this when working around the house in the yard and at the gym stays in place very well and gives easy access to the control wheel of my ipod has stood up to more than a year of heavy use and is still doing well for me	19
1	easy to mount on the wall though this item came with hardware with different sizes i still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied this mount perfectly suited for my 46 sony lcd flat panel in about 30 min i could mount tv on this bracket	19
0	i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds the sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable	19
0	it 's too small and signal is too weak the life of battery is too short not recomment to buy this you can find some other model better quality	19
0	there are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player well it comes with no software or anything else if all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i	19
1	this is a great product for your mini the armband is well constructed from a neoprene type material \( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty \) with heavy duty velcro all the way around and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance this is n't a super cheap armband but as they say you \( usually \) get what you pay for this should last you for years of gymming running biking	19
1	these fit over everything very well and they stayed put without stretching out which is why my original pads fell off i guess it 's one of those products that you ca n't do much better than 10 for but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something	19
1	if you own a canon digital camera this printer is great it is portable and makes great prints people think they are from a photolab it is also vey easy to use i have seen other mini printers from olympus and sony and they are not as good they cost more too	19
0	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud where 's the tylenol !	19
1	this might be the best thing apple has ever made it works perfectly with my mac book pro and my pcs the security is awsome and it has great range with easy instalation after many flaws with my lynksys i took the risk with this and it was worth it i have never had a problem with this	19
1	i have multiple cameras and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time if you have a sd card and a cf card both can be inserted and read written to without having to switch out the cards very nice reader for a great price the blue led is very pleasant to look at	19
0	the apple remote is included with the imac g5 and works great with it and front row however for the ipod it 's almost useless the lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling in short do n't buy this remote look at other non apple remotes that are more full featured	19
1	i use this subwoofer to augment my 7 1 system it was easy to install gives excellent response and i could n't be more pleased	19
1	i purchased 4 of these adapters \( 3 extra \) so i could hook up my macbook 's digital output for digital surround sound through my logitech speakers the product works exactly as i expected great digital sound from my macbook parts express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than i expected \( ordered on a saturday and they had the package to the courier by saturday night \) very prompt service i would definitely order from them again overall a great product from a prompt company !	19
0	other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms907 you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms 40 wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one	19
1	this is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer all in one this unit can protect your sensitive high end audio system computers and video moniters from everyday power surges power sags over voltages and brown outs these surges pick away at your sensitive equipment taking years off their useful life i own and highly recommend this unit	19
0	after nearly two weeks i'm still waiting for kingston to ship out replacement ram the ram was installed and after just one day the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning after calling kingston several times they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet it 's been two weeks i would strongly consider a different brand next time this company is not responsive	19
0	i just received the printer in trying to set it up i realized there is no computer to printer cable included nor any explanation of what kind you need you have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema	19
0	this picturemate has been a total disaster after printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos do not waste your money on this product	19

1	as your dvd cd collections grow these are ideal for protecting and storing your treasures easy to open and take up little storage space the center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease just a great product	19
0	cases very cheaply made break when opening not worth shipping cost waste of money	19
0	the printer works great as a usb printer a fax machine and copier it may as well not even have a network port on it the networking driver will find the printer but then it goes back to searching fora printer and this loop continues till you give up i ca n't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem i can tell you that a dell 1600 works great as a network printer network scanner fax copier we have 3 of these and we tried this hp 3055 and i would not reccommend it to anyon	19

1	the carry case does the job of holding my walkman and therefore i say it is worth the money however i have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position but with some effort it does overall i am happy with the purchase	19
1	very good product you do need to use help menue for instructions because the paperwork that comes with it does n't tell you a lot overall i'm having fun using this product	19
1	this mouse has never let me down really works on most of the surfaces	19
0	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small now i am stuck with something i cannot use your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened how is one to know unless they open it	19

0	i wanted to convert an hp laserjet 4 plus to a networked printer even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work the customer support is claimed to be 24 7 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet this product cost more than a linksys router so customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time	19
0	this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons 1 this hub will not work with any usb powered devices so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub 2 extremely slow usb 1 1 this device is not usb 2 0 compliant3 it is clunky4 does not comke with a power adapte	19
0	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i'm very disappointed and i'm returning it	19
1	i love the sling media slingbox tuner ! the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days ! you rock amazon !	19
1	i just purchased a mogo mouse and i'm amazed at how usable it is i was extremely skeptical \( and probably would n't have bought one \) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is the one thing and it 's a pretty big thing is the lack of scroll wheel technology that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse that said there are always trade offs but in this case that 's the only one battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !	19
1	i got my replacement battery and put into the computer the date started working whenever the computer is off and i have n't had any problems	19
1	pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts	19
0	check 10 cases at least 6 are broken in new box i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces	19
1	i have and have had lots of sw radios including a number of sonys this is one of their many gems great perfomance lots of memories and snazzy look good for travel \( certainly not as compact as the sw100 of course \) a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio and do n't want to spend very much good for listening and good for dxing while traveling look no further	19
1	all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long due to the furniture arrangement in my living room i needed a longer cable to make the connection i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me the connections are solid and the sound quality is great it was well worth the money	19
0	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted meanwhile i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i 've used better and worse that said it 's definitely not worth the full asking price	19
0	when i went to use this product i did n't even have it for a day and the antenna broke	19
1	this has a nice size screen it only has 3 buttons play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button i just found this out by trial there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital this would only last a second or two at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them the volume control is on the side as well as the power button it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me	19
1	i just made a long trip from miami florida all the way to s carolina with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 everything worked just fine i installed the software unlock it upload the maps all with out any problems the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard from inside the vehicle worked very well never took more than a minute to track all satellites the street route where very accurate never got lost working with poi 's was very simple did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit	19
0	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer	19
0	besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my 4 port kvm stopped functioning after six months there 's no information on the web to help either it 's as if there is no way to fix a kvm that does n't work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin 's website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin does n't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin 's without cables	19
1	this is truly the best wifi you can get on the market right now its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1 most importantly i 've had the best gaming experience ever now i can host games on xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun the linksys wrt330n wireless n gigabit gaming router is well worth its money and a great investment i recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great wifi for whatever reason	19

1	outstanding product ! keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 usb ports	19
1	my husband and father both have this unit it 's really handy to have on road trips and to use while geocaching from our experience it does take a while to download map information onto the unit and a color screen would be nice but for 200 i think it 's a good value	19
1	i really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use ! ! it clips nicely onto my laptop or i can take it off it comes with a little protective case and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you 're not using i really like it and all its features as well	19

0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
0	it seems nice enough and it 's cheap but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs for use with those cameras buy sandisck instead seriously	19
1	i use this on my macbook works flawlessly to hookup a tv via svideo osx handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that i use when i have it hooked up plug it in and video switches to tv settings unplug it and its back to normal i use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook and i just get extra desktop space when i plug the tv in the quality is quite suprising for s video very good 100 must have for anyone that has a nice tv	19

0	this item produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x5 is entirely useless the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger i returned mine immediately if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed ill fitting unacceptable piece of worthless junk	19
0	this is an excellent item for anyone on the go who has an ipod nano no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano	19
1	needed the adapter to charge my shuffle since the ac adapter i have is one of those older apple ones with the firewire connector suits my needs perfectly no experience with any sound docks however so i ca n't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up	19
1	these headphones sound pretty good but they are n't the best when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones for running i would recommend something else	19
1	popped it in works like a charm hardest part is opening the packaging but other than that no worries	19
0	with no mode settings \( repeat shuffle etc \) or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you	19
1	i just got mine from amazon \( after a lengthly delay \) it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i 've already used up 600 mb its a must buy ! plus at 99 99 its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at 104 99 then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too	19
0	the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for 3 4 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk	19
1	this is a good compact flash card this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive	19
0	i loved these earbuds for 5 weeks right up until they stopped working the wires to the ipod \( the stationary wires not the ones that wind up \) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case but quickly stopped working altogether too bad they 're comfortable the sound is fine \( great on the bus \) and the retraction works good	19
0	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality	19
1	same as everybody else i ordered mine a couple of days back and it has n't shipped i want it ! ! ! ! !	19
0	i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great i decided i wanted another for work so i ordered another one i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the preset weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled they sent me a replacement and it too is off station at this point i'm wondering if the first one i got was the exception i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am fm radio that part works great this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first !	19
0	the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still ca n't believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to back up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this	19

1	just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they 've lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i'm not an audiophile so i do n't need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story do n't twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my earscons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil	19
1	this bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my apple notebook be sure to insert the bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin i thought mine was in far enough at first but it really was n't one caveat i was hoping that the bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room but it 's not also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both bluetooth and cable at the same time	19

1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot it is also silent and convenient it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable it was no problem to reformat to ntfs	19

1	the price i paid for this spindle of cd r 's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet the only price that i have seen that beats this one was staples running a sale of 50 for 10 but i have yet to use the stock that i bought as i still have about 25 left on the spindle if you do n't want to wait for their sale this is an excellent bargain the print surface has done very well with the inks from my epson photo r 220	19
1	the other effusive reviews are spot on the picture is fabulous on new dvds \( lord of the rings nemo harry potter \) a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony kdf 42e2000 42 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies \( some like it hot the king and i \) stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips	19

1	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed ca n't complain especially for the price	19

1	i have purchased over two dozen of these units this is the best unit for the price there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input also the card slots are a plus two things to be aware of if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required not a one disc does all unit	19
1	if your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy like me i would highly suggest this product sounds are crystal clear and fiber optics is the next step up in technology my first question for you would be how much do you invest in your gaming \? once again if your like me the answer is a lot my next question would be how important is your audio experience \? you dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference very happy with this product	19
0	i liked the md671 for the home office so i thought the md7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone not so the handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking i tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem if you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable right	19
0	after having installed the unit for 43 days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting this was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit flying ! very dangerous ! ! tomtom would not replace the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks ! buyer beware see the tomtom forum for description and picture and other links to the base issue	19

1	i am kind of a shortwave junkie and have a few radios all over the place i must admit that for the money spent and the performance and endurance this little bugger is probably my best buy ! i cannot believe the sound quality or the reception its phenominal ! i can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where i work ! \( big heavy steel freezers \) it is a simple small no frills pocket size radio but it blows away anything in its price range trust me	19
1	this battery will transform your epson picturemate deluxe viewer edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute must have item ! i take it with me when ever i'm doing an off site photo shoot or even when i'm out for a weekend shooting candids the portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless i have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge	19

1	i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i have n't authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd \( movie all the extras \) under 50 minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px 755uf for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap \( plug n play \)	19
1	very easy to assemble has very classic lines lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation hard to find add on shelf in maple holds a lot of equipment	19
1	i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office the reception on this unit is great bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound	19

1	i owned a bose wave radio for a number of years the price was well beyond my financial means but i made the sacrifice and i'm very glad i did the sound defied belief and i was very pleased you will be too forget the detractors herein they know nothing like the reviewer who listened to am radio if the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you then any radio will suffice but if a clear sound is what you 're going for then go buy a bose wave radio ! you 'll be glad you did i know that i am	19

1	totally agree with the other reviewers' comments originally i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus even with shipping this is still cheaper \( by 5 bucks \) and its metal ! fyi if you do n't have any filters \( like i did n't \) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm \( circular polarizer uv protector and 812 warming len \) a good buy for the price i bought it because of the reviewers' comments and do n't regret it	19
1	the tapes are exactly what i had searched the web for thanks to amaxon com for listing the seler	19
1	this unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery however replacing that was quick and easy although irritating after installation and use for a while i noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls if you do n't speak immediately after pickup the telemarketer hears the tone and hangs up ! great item	19

1	you can count on every monster cable made it 's worth the extra money over the cheap ones the gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19

1	i want the dvds i'm making to last to as close to forever as possible so i did a lot of research before deciding what dvds to buy verbatim came out as 1 for durability i chose the dvd r format for maximum compatibility with various devices and i 've only had a few errors after burning about 75 dvds amazon 's sale price for these was great if you 're just looking for short term backup media i'm sure you can find cheaper but these are a different class of dvds	19
1	i purchased the casio keyboard for my grand daughter 's 4th birthday she really enjoyed playing it as a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day it is the perfect size for a small child she sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms the only thing that was n't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it	19
1	i have been using memorex dvd r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player recorder not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this 50 pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many dvd r blank media i found memorex dvd r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance	19
1	i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it but that 's really a personal problem	19
1	the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it although i had considered just getting a refund amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	19
0	the software is terrible slow and glitchy i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player the operators manual is just under 100 pages so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls granted the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual	19
1	this is a great product for those who probably do n't write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally	19
0	this site is hard to find the ink cartridge i need 78 tri color for my hp 750	19
0	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	i'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but i was looking for something softer smaller for my apparently small earholes	19
0	i am a person who actually uses these items alot after 2 weeks of using these headphones the right earpiece quit playing and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating also it is too expensive i am enjoying the zune but all the accessories should be a little more accessible	19

1	very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my epson stylus cx6600 compatibles do not compare	19
1	i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	19
0	egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity	19
1	so far so good ! only takes up 1u in our rack this product arrived in good shape and on time setup was a breeze right now we only have 2 servers connected to it but switching between them is no problem so i do n't foresee a problem when we add 4 more kevi	19
1	one lvel up from the es30vs much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well remote control is easier to use than the last generation the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button i am very happy with this uni	19
0	i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be 110 for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that 110 i have other eight \( 8 \) lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i 'll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one	19
0	these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder but nothing special as you see the price is down to 22 00 which is probably a good price for these \( unfortunatly i bought them at 50 00 and had to return them	19
1	these folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory and amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it 's like money in the bank i hope no one comes in and tries to improve things	19
0	had to give it one star because there is nothing lower this printer was the answer to my printing dreams for about three months with light home use only fault at that time is it is loud it will wake the dead which is ok since the dead do n't have to print things that often this is the perfect printer for them other than noise a faulty load paper error kept coming up then the paper load went bad it is very unreliable and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop tonight i'm trashing it buying another printer tonight ! do not waste your money on this piece of trash	19
1	it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning using the item \( i put it back on but fell off a couple more times \) i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well	19
1	i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i'm very happy	19

1	i used to buy energizers and duracells at 3 4 a pop for four batteries now i buy generic alkalines at costco cost 8 for 10 four packs it 's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer according to a recent coprehensive story in consumer reports there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries	19

1	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	19

1	i struggled between this and the shure e2c i decided on the e2c after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3 this one has the least clarity but wonderful bass if i do n't listen to as much classical music i 'd definitely pick vmoda vibe it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason and i had an extremely hard time putting it in even with the help of my bf the vmoda did not come with any foam only the silicon ear pieces i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c	19
1	i originally bought my daughter an ilive ibcd3816dt boombox for her birthday the hiss was unbearable so i took it back and purchased this product much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2gb ipod nano using the supplied insert very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone it sounds great looks good and the controls are very intuitive	19
0	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic definently not worth the 15 i paided for them	19
0	heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?	19
1	great price ! cant compare it to the more expensive monster cables but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components	19
1	i have an explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove good sturdy bracket uni directional with strong suction cups installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield great product for the money \( in my case 30 76 free shipping \) purchased a second one for my other vehicle	19
1	i was a little worried about spending almost 70 on this bag but when i recieved it i was so impressed i really love this bag ! very well made ! ! the crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows but i really like it to be honest i shy away from croc patterns but it really works with this bag ! i have a 15 4 in gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag	19

1	i wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports i bought two and both worked fine right out of the box not the fastest card ever but certainly large storage for the price	19
0	i followed the install instructions to the letter but the install program started giving me an error that i could n't get past i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error but i could n't get the print server to connect to my wireless network when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable it detected the attached printer but could n't even print a test page successfully this product was a complete waste of time	19
1	this wall mount works and hold 's great i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems the instructions are not all that clear but it is not hard to figure out how to instal	19
1	i am a mild audophile and i love these headphones they have great base response treble and isolation if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music	19
1	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least pick one up you wont regret it	19
0	i have this setup with my new laptop that runs vista premium the device installs ok and it works with media center it 's great for watching tv but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in standby mode until it 's time to record you may be disappointed when coming out of standby sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not when it 's not recognized i have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized because of this i have missed several recordings i contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby	19
1	i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing ! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go	19
0	i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that did n't last long the connection would not hold and if i did n't hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less	19
0	this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it	19
1	these speakers can almost hit any range of sound but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side they put out very crisp sound for my system you might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound	19
0	i went online to amazaon a site i trusted to locate an hd radio for my desk at work this was listed as an hd radio only after i received it opened it and plugged it in did i discover it is not an hd radio both the 3rd party vendor and amazon claim i have no right to a refund the fcc calls this fraud and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation	19
0	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
1	there is not a lot to this device simply plug the wire that comes with it into your yamaha amplifier and receiver and away you go the ipod gets charged and on my receiver i can even select the song to play via the on screen gui on the tv	19
1	not as easy to use as a larger panasonic i used to own butotherwise fine good sound using cd player and radio buying via amazon as usual is super	19
0	it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony 's compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc30	19

1	excellant product excellant price hope to do business again ty for fast speedy shipment a pleasure doing business with you	19
0	unfortunately i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead this was not amazon 's fault but emile henry 's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not in fairness to amazon they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled althought i would have preferred the oval bakers i kept the rectangular ones and do like them	20
0	i placed an online order of the set at ronco and cancelled it 5 minutes later to confirm my concellation is in time i called ronco hours later despite their promise on the phone they still send the package after i refuses to accept the shipment \( follow their instruction \) they still charge me 35 for the shipping these people do business in such disgraceful way how can you expect a good quality product from them	20
0	the unit has nice large digits but the wireless sensors do n't work consistantly the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re established	20
0	this tea cattle is absolutely adorable it is not practical for daily use the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove the lid does n't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move	20
1	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef 's knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	20
1	this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole soup tureen handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only good for a large group rather than due to large capacity we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox	20
1	this was the first item that i purchased on amazon item was received in excellent condition and in a very timely manner very pleased	20
0	do n't waste your money on this unless you like your coffee luke warm \( i ca n't imagine it \) you will not be satisfied with this product i am promptly returning mine	20
0	this is not and i repeat is not a good alarm there is one alarm light and you can hardly tell which one is sounding it looks as if the specs are lying to me and i hate lies also the battery died after 6 8 months the low battery alert is loud and chirps so anoyingly i also noticed that the alarm sounds a loud shrieking alarm when it sounds i will return this alarm never again will i trust in first alert	20
0	the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down	20
1	my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i 've never had problems with it the material is light but very sturdy i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that wo n't happen for quite a while	20
0	i'm not happy the filter needed changing one day out of the box we have soft water so this should have lasted a while difficult to hang on to when filling have to hold it like a baby does put out the air though and fits about anywhere	20
1	the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisseriethe grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals	20
0	i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we 'll have to live with the damage it 's a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time	20
1	i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job	20
0	they sent me a blue hudson jacquard diamond love seat slipcover 3 times i gave up after the 3rd time what really sux is that they did send the olive sofa cover ! ! ! so now they do n't match ! ! !	20
1	we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it it toasts consistently it accommodates all widths and the digital selector is great	20
0	bought one it quit working within 6 weeks the litter box lid never did fit correctly and the unit just stopped running littermaid sent a replacement the lid on the replacement would n't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment after some fine tuning the unit worked for three days before quitting perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived the units i have bought and received are useless as it is i'm out 170 with no hope of a fix	20
1	living on a ranch i get a lot of junk tracked into the house this handy broom vac lets you do a quick clean up and be done it has been a life saver and works great on my hardwood floors	20

0	i bought this only because i wanted a pair of stainless shears you do need your muscles though i am using it to remove the fins from fish good luck	20
1	i bought the fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living in arizona the butter sold there is packaged in shorter wider and higher sized sticks so it did n't fit into the butter dish unless i trimmed it ! ! could n't figure it out why would they make a butter dish that a stick of butter wo n't fit into \? \? ! ! so have just moved to the houston area and guess what the butter here is sized just right for the dish maybe they need to make two different sizes for west and east coast butter \? \? crazy ! nice butter dish though	20

1	we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone i built a knife holder to use in a drawer now with the wusthof 25 slot i have removed my home made holder the drawer can be used to store other items i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years there is no need to buy a lot of new knives just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use you ca n't go wrong with this super storage block	20
1	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully i am very pleased with my purchase !	20
0	bought this model would not brew a full cup of coffee no matter what i did called customer service and they sent me a new one this one also did not work all it did was flash blue lights and never brewed a cup tossed it out and bought a different model by black and decker have had it for months and never had a problem with the new model	20
0	these lights are junk but the vendor i purchased them from is excellen	20
1	saw a demo of this at a local sur la table and very impressed the coffee it makes is outstanding i plan to buy one later this year amazon is being deceptive about price they state list price is 2400 and they 're selling it for 1798 95 at a savings of 601 05 not ! look at the jura capresso website the list for the impressa f9 is 1799 that brings amazon 's big discount down to a whole 0 05 the higher end impressa s9 is 2399 \( and amazon claims it is 3200 \) do your research do n't trust amazon 's claims for msrp	20
1	this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces	20
0	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet item is being returned	20
0	read the info about this product carefully this listing is not for kitchen scissors but rather poultry shears chef 's choice does make the 8 kitchen scissors in the picture but that is not what you will get if you order these i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon	20
0	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone do n't waste your money on it	20
1	this is a great product it comes with clips for a shoulder strap but no strap that is the only thing left wanting	20
1	the delonghi heater is light weight has multiple settings safety knock over switch thermostat and a remote i have moved it room to room and it has worked wonderfully the price was reasonable i would buy it again this is a good brand	20
0	i rate this negative five stars i just purchased it thinking after reading all the reviews that it was great what a crock ! ! ! ! it 's absolutely worthless it does not clean the water it 's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy the water flows and the motor is running the charcoal is in place but it does n't clean the water i'm better off with a bowl that i clean every day this thing just swishes around dirty water do n't waste your money	20
1	this has got to be the greatest little heater the only problem that i had was getting it to stop beeping when you change a setting other than that i really like the remote and use this in my office at work	20
1	i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp especially appreciated are the easy separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid gripper for opening jars and bottles	20
1	when i first saw this dehumidifier i could n't stop laughing this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed \? i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better \( bigger \) dehumidifier i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little bitty sucked up an inch of water in one night ! ! ! now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem the free shipping was a great plus as well ! !	20
0	worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out guess you get what you pay for	20
0	with an old coffee can true it does n't have the odor free aspect but if you are scooping a litter box there is going to be odor i just keep the can by the box and dump it in the trash when full same deal	20
0	i have two earlier aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies this new premier durasuede is like lying on a sheet of tin the material is so stiff it does not conform to our body i find it unusable	20
0	i expected better durability out of this fan it died after just 3 months and had flow problems from day one i tried contacting lasko but got no responses	20
1	this is the best snaps on easily cleans easily works just great our cats love to pull out the grass just like they were outside they love it and it is a great conversation piece just like the drinkwell our cats are truly spoiled !	20
1	the refill accessory \( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes \) definitely cuts the refill maintenance in half since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected	20
1	the merchandise purchased was to be a wedding shower gift when i received it i found minor damage and contacted the shipper who requested it 's return the replacement merchandise was in perfect condition and i happily gift wrapped it and forwarded it to the future bride i have not had an acknowledgement to date and hope that it arrived in good condition i am totally satisfied with service i received	20
0	this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year	20
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	20
1	ever since my curlers arrived i have been obsessed i love the curls i get from the larger size just roll your hair when you wake up do your make eat breakfast and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers \( very painless \) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials i love this product ! ! !	20
0	this is a lemon lime press the oranges in china must be real small so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit	20
1	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	20
1	my six month old son would not eat anything off a spoon or out of a bottle finally i tried mixing baby cereal and putting it in this then i mixed cereal and babyfood and or mashed food he loves it ! no gagging either ! i'm here now buying the replacement bags	20

1	high quality soft and absorbent large all cotton bath sheets areexactly as described and really hold up in laundering and usage great items	20
0	my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked \? not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it	20
0	sometimes it sprays when she barks most of the time it does n't so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it 's not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine \( my children found this amusing	20
0	i ordered this product 3 months back as they say got into the line this item was part of an larger order so i could have gotten free shipping now i get an email from amazon stating this item has been cancelled as it was further delayed and as i did not respond to thier email for extending the wait time i never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered if i need one then i will end up paying shipping too amazon is normally good about these things how can they still have it listed on the site when they are cancelling orders in the pipeline	20
1	i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon com and i absolutely love the rich cinnamon color of cinnabar ! the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal soup ice cream and leftovers \( smaller portions \) it 's microwaveable too ! if you 've never used fiestaware before this would be a great introduction to the line especially if you have use for smaller soup cereal bowls	20
1	we use this to serve ice water at meals it is so beautiful it holds a full 2 qts not much else to say about it it is a water pitcher after all it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table we have two one for each end of the table	20
1	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it 's also compact i gained a little more counter space	20
1	looks great just what i wanted i ca n't believe i have filled it up already \( i feel like such a chef	20
1	my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments all costing a fortune we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear this stuff is great and at 1 2 the price of prescription and no vet charges i'm happy to keep it on hand	20
1	i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook 's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list ! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas it is now my favorite knife and is used daily after cutting veggies fish meats and fruit this knife continues to be extremely sharp well balanced and easy to use what a great gift	20
0	this item has not functioned at all for me removable of the battery cover required rubber gloves for traction and the opener would not open a 2 3 4 inch diameter can a cute little useless item	20
1	sheets are great just the lace on top can be bothersome when sleepin	20
1	glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter point to reidel anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable	20

0	my kids think this is a better toy than our dog was n't worth the money i paid for it comes apart too easy	20
1	i bought a few of these collars out of desperation in the past my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on since i was moving recently i was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home i bought these collars because of the reviews and everything that the other reviewers say is true the only thing i 'll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months but it 's still the only kind i 'll use for him at this price i can easily afford replacements	20
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	20
0	i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it 's trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	20
1	i did n't know which maker i wanted it was hard making up my mind i finally chose this one and boy did i make the right choice it works great better than i could have hoped for cookies turned out wonderful and it was fast and easy	20

0	a few times it worked great but mostly it brewed uneven i'm not being a nitpicker here literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim there was no pattern to it sometimes it was the left one sometimes the right one sometimes neither filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging do n't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter ! it only took two days before i realized this was not worth the money or the time	20
0	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
1	love it ! rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it wo n't break if packed away makes good froth too	20
1	those sheets are so sweet i bought them in several colors it 's a dream to sleep in them	20
0	okay there 's something wrong with brita filters they do n't always fit into the pitchers when i tilt the pitcher i can hear the filter shifting inside and yes i am aligning it properly it may filter out impurities contained in the tap water but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles i 've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month but darned if there is n't a problem with every single one ! do n't buy this look for another alternative	20
0	was very disappointed in this comforter while it is heavy like i had anticipated it is not soft in any way shape or form it is like newspaper it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long	20
1	i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner this is a gaget worth having my husband even loves it it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze it gets plenty of use and it still going strong it is very user friendly and so easy to empty	20
0	not up to standard set by other kitchenaid pro line appliances when dessert is frozen will not dispense even with mix engaged when thawed dessert turns to near water consistancy no way to remove dessert other than through dispenser no control to modulate freezing either on or off manual setting when front comes off for cleaning retained liquid runs down the front of the machine short of the drip pan	20
1	i love this it keeps the bed toasty i takes some time to warm up the bed i turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour when i get it it 's very nice and i turn it down to 1 or 2 i find if i keep it on 5 all night i roast i do prefer this product to an electric blanket it has n't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills and it was worth the purchase price if you have a big pillowtop mattress the pad does n't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet otherwise i would have given the product 5 stars	20
0	gaggia used to be the cat 's meow in espresso they have lost the bubble in the last ten years many other machines do more are easier to use and produce better cups in an easier manner i still have my old gaggia but now rely on a saeko in my home the difference is obvious	20
1	this was the second highest rated bundt pan in cook 's illustrated i used an oil flour baking spray and my bundt cake popped out with ease it 's lightweight but perfect for me since i only use it a few times a year	20
1	after several tries and telephone calls to my brother i finally have the blade in the correct position \( i had problems with the directions in the book \) it works great now a reminder to oil the blades before you put the machine away they rust easily if damp	20
0	loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use total waste of money and shipping	20
0	ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot \? \? now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot ! now i know that they are not supposed to be like this ! ! ! do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk ! ! ! ! ! on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours ! ! ! ! i am trashing mine today ! !	20
1	we bought our french skillet two years ago and it has yet to even have one scratch on the cooking surface it can go in the dishwasher and although we usually hand wash it it is nice to know that easy clean up is possible it gets used in our house every day and is very durable i am planning on purchasing more for my family ! we also have a covered pan and a six inch pan that we use almost as much in my opinion you wo n't be disappointed in this pan	20
1	now i do n't know whether you are a die hard hello kitty fan or not but you gotta have this ! the numerous different settings the awesome design and the fact that it 's hello kitty makes it worth it 's weight in gold i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays ! so that worked well these toasters are cheap as they come online here so grab em and go ! good luck if ya get one ! \( the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too !	20
0	this came broken the packaging was not good damage good do n't make happy custome	20
1	for the money you ca n't beat this duve	20
0	i received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so i called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc i have since returned both pads in the same box	20
0	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after this one did n't even work out of the box there was no mist just air oh well i figured i was taking my chances anyway if you buy this hopefully you have better luck update nowadays most grocery stores sell pre packaged pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time	20
0	after two months a piece of the filter broke off after 3 months the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website so i could pay another 30 or so for a new carafe because glass is not included in their warranty no thanks	20
0	my timer did n't work either it arrived broken in two pieces and even though i was able to put it back together it just did n't work back it went it 's cute but pretty much useless	20
1	i found this same item at a target store in stock for only 39 99 they also have it for sale on line for the same price it 's a great chair	20
0	the heater works fine but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period i will not buy an oil filled heater again	20
1	rapid efficient sturdy and easy to clean must to attached to the edge of a counter and the right edge was hard to find i hand pitted cherries for 90 minutes and completed the same number in 15 minutes with the cherry pitter	20
0	the frother works well as others have said unfortunately it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning i 've only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events	20
0	we got this as a gift amp used it its loud and spits out water we 're not happy with it	20
1	still find it somewhat big for a dorm room \( but if you have a double and are sharing the fridge this much room is probably necessary \) but works great	20
1	i'm puzzled by the several reviews that say the filter gets moldy too fast i am replacing my first filter after about a year because it has built up deposits of lime i never noticed any mold	20
0	when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway	20
0	i was disappointed when it arrived in pieces they didn't pack this well and i had to send it back i was impressed by the free return postage i do want this item and have requested another hopefully it will arrive in one piece this time then it might be worth more stars	20
0	the add said it would seperate small berry seeds the holes on the smallest grate are about 1 8 you could fit 20 seed through one of them very disappointing	20
1	have had the granos for about 1 month great espresso great latte and great design i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved but only time will tell	20
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i did n't hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore	20
1	i really enjoy cooking in this pot it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes the enamel surface is wonderful i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family the only drawback is how heavy the pot is but that does n't change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen !	20
1	i bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of calphalon forged kitchen knives that i recently purchased i have used oriental water stones in the past and this stone is as good as any i have used with just a few strokes it will turn a calphalon henckles or wusthof into a gillette with this stone and a good steel your knives will last far beyond your years	20
1	eeks mice are great ! most catnip mice lose their flavor smell attraction for my cats pretty quickly but my cats still play with an eeks i 've had for over a year the one drawback is that they do n't look too good after being played with \( teeth marks drool stains ripped off tails etc \) but cats do n't care about that	20
0	i was pleased with the way the hoover cleaned my floors except that i had to empty the containers too many times after using it for 3 or 4 weeks i realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible i hope i can return it because i can no longer use it terry sit	20
1	i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk it is great if you like to make lattes or just plain expressos it brews fast less than two minutes it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes	20
1	we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon they were the best gifts we gave immediate hits with each couple one in their late 50 's one in the mid 20 's in each case the response was the same it 's like my childhood they are going in the living room each season vivid but soft these are superb decorations	20
1	i 've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32 and this works great ! i have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor this product lets me pick the length i need it 's metal materials makes it quite durable too hooray	20
0	i 've ordered three two were broken as were two replacements they sent fragile plastic breaks and ca n't support the weight of the drawers and spices they were really nice about sending replacements and refunds though	20
0	i bought this item based on price how can you go wrong for 10 for a programable coffee maker \? well you get what you pay for after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks it just stopped working ! just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item ! based on the rest of the reviews i just threw away and went out and bought a mr coffee lesson learned treehous	20
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly i feel we made a good choice	20
0	i like this type of opener very much and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing so i opened the package and tried to open a bottle of wine but the corkscrew would not lock i'm not even sure i 'll send it back given the warranty hassle shipping costs etc given the price i just ca n't recommend this brand to anyone	20
0	washed them once \( before using \) and now they look really old they have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them i am not impressed would not buy again	20
1	cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you 'll have bases covered	20
1	i bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine i was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it this carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours a great upgrade	20
1	i recently purchased the sakura embossed palm 16 pc dinnerware set for my mom for christmas she absolutely loves them they are so unique and when she has company over for dinner gets many compliments on them nobody has ever seen dinnerware like these before she is a big fan of palm trees and these fit her collection nicely	20
1	ice bucket is smaller than i expected otherwise a very good product	20
1	this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot i would expect to pay much more for such a product the grind is even and consistent the appearance is sleek and modern yet classic i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift	20
1	this whale is so much fun i got it for when my sisters kids came down they had a hard time staying on it though but it was fun for me it was such a hit i have two now they got one for me before they left saying now you gots two so next time we come you can ride too overall great strong and fun	20
0	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	20
0	this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso this will not pass for a full time espresso drinker the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso	20
0	i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time i was sorely disappointed there is no measuring cup so all water amounts must be estimated \( the unit has three lines to help but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs \) there is no buzzer when the unit is finished so unless you babysit it everything ends up overcooking this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled	20
1	good fabric and nice size great for the price free	20
1	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special	20
0	nice looking but not easy to move the bar at the top is n't smooth and it hurts if you try to move the stool with one hand also it arrived with the top plastic piece broken on one side disappointed not worth the trouble of returning	20
1	my grandma 's 10 year old yorkie just would never shut up he barked at our cat at our parrot and anything that moved really we bought this collar and it worked perfectly and immediately one bark and it sprayed and he would go running off and stop barking ! i felt kinda bad for him but his reaction was hilarious i could n't stop laughing at him poor thing however he did learn that if the collar was n't on he was n't going to get sprayed so he would bark	20
0	i often have to mix by hand things always end up dry and grainy might be partially my fault maybe i should try adding the ingredients as it 's mixing it makes a really huge mess my mother and i both bought one but i told her to return hers it was n't worth it	20
1	i own dozens of wine glasses from the most expensive lead crystal to winery logo glasses i also have a set of reidel vinum 's as well i bought these for everyday dishwasher use wow ! both the red and white are wonderful i side by side taste tested \( glass to glass \) my chardonnay \( yes mine \) and the white wine glass was way above average and perfect for everyday frankly white wine dose n't need a snifter glass as some do tip it also helps to not fill the glass to the top and please do n't freeze the chardonnay !	20
1	it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed	20
1	i received great customer service and a beautiful plant here i would recommend this gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift my gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition is still very healthy and smells terrific i 've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said what smells so good grandma \?	20
0	had this grinder for 8 months two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds i'm tossing it and getting a different brand all form no function	20
0	great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me ! i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it 's not worth replacing again argh	20
0	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	the space between the strands is much greater than shown in the picture the cutrain will not hide what is behind it	20
1	this is a very useful shot glass as you can see use it for measuring cocktails or for drinking a shot of your favorite liquor it is a very sturdy glass i highly recommend	20
1	i only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter has n't slept in it yet but i set it up and it was super easy almost one touch set up it is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome it has moons and stars on it the take down was 5 minutes if that it 's small enough to fit almost anywhere and deep enough so that a toddler \( my daughter is 2 \) will not roll off \) love it and i know i will be using it often	20
0	we 've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip and or crack they are beautiful and affordable but they just do not last i had two plates crack in half in the microwave a mug handle break off as i slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack it 's too bad because i really liked this set	20
0	after just 7 months so be aware that you might buy into some hassle by exchanging the knifes with henckels i am very dissappointed and will not spend that much money \( 80 \) on knifes ever again at least not on henckels my k mart knifes hold up better	20
1	the fact that you do n't have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great ! we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express it is a great product works great	20
1	this is the best way to clean a grill i use one each time that i clean the grill this is a must buy it is a great idea	20
0	i hate to rate something so low but my experience warrants a low score the larger burner was defective from the onset the knob turned but the burner remained on and at full it seemed regardless of the knob 's setting i had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on the smaller burner worked ! amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well packing seemed fine too guess it was a manufacturing defect hopefully this does n't happen to many others	20
0	this grater is fine when you can get it to work but most often the handle does n't screw in correctly and you ca n't get it to it 's mostly a waste of time though the concept is a great one i 'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one	20
0	this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it does n't create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one	20
0	i really made a mistake and bought 2 sets thinking i could always have extras ready i tried all types of grinds i packed loosely i packed firmly i packed tight i played and played still did not get a good cup of coffee finally threw them out just taking up space learned a lesson on buying quantity	20
1	i love the large size of these tumblers as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them the thermal feature works good the ice lasts longer and they do n't sweat so i do n't need coasters under them they are colorful so each guest can have their own color no mix ups they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher and they do n't seem to be marked or scratched yet after seeing mine my daughter in law got some as did two sets of my friends i am so glad to have found them !	20
0	i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift	20
0	ditto the other 's observations the thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room i had the thing in a 63 degree room had it set to 85 degrees it would register 90 after 30 seconds of running turn off slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period and then repeat the temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees	20
1	these tables are great i bought two of them solid wood classic design that will still look good in 10 years and easy no fuss assembly all this at a great price pick one up	20
0	very hard to put together drawers came broken both times cute though not at all sturd	20
0	clock is smaller than i thought and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall made of cheap materials definitely not worth 25	20
1	for many years i had a presto pressure cooker but when the sealing ring did n't work a few years back i tossed it out thinking i could never get a replacement ring i missed having that pot i'm glad to have one once again stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one but tonight will be spare ribs the new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one it works the same in the end though i would have opted for the aluminum as that was what i had but my husband bought the stainless steel i do n't think it makes a difference for the price except in appearance	20
1	this is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids they love to eat them and make their own	20
0	this product is ok it 's just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint catching fabric the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast but for what it is this attachment is ridiculously overpriced	20
1	this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money do n't buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you 'll be glad that you did	20
0	i purchased four of these pillows ! i really should n't have wasted my money they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up i 'd rather sleep without a pillow at all ! !	20
0	i wanted a humidifier that was silent but when i plugged this in not only could i hear it from the other room but it 's a high pitched whine i do n't know what to do about it i think i 'll probably just return it for something different	20
1	my husband and i took over a house with 2 kitchens and i wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black i fell in love with these but never received them they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time amazon would n't send them again and i gave up i went ahead and gave them 5 stars 'cause i was at a freinds house and she had these dishes they were really heavy and the print was consistent i'm so jealous	20
0	i'm terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute does n't hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself	20
1	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you wo n't bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces	20
1	at first i was n't so sure if it would work then it really worked ! ! it was amazing now every day i can a chocolate covered item whenever i want !	20
0	i purchased four of these shot glasses of the four one has tiny bubbles throughout one has black specs in the glass one has a bulge in the glass and the last is taller than the other three the shape is beautiful but with all the imperfections i 'd recommend something else my most disappointing bodum purchase ever	20
0	coffee warmer only keeps coffee lukewarm so i am still in the market for a coffee warmer	20
0	the decanter 's pretty the wine topper is okay however the picture is misleading these two items are clearly not meant to be paired the topper does not fit must have been very carefully balanced for the photo but it sure wo n't stay that way the topper is made for a bottled wine not a decanter	20
0	i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews but it is n't so hot the light is n't very bright and quite diffused and the light sensor is n't sensitive enough it stays on in all but the brightest light i ordered two but have only opened one and the other is likely to stay in its packaging	20
1	this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it 's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you 'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it 's worth it for such a fine knife	20
0	this bread box had to be fixed by the time i received it it was a minor thing and works well however i would not have bothered buying the box had i known that there would be problems with it	20
0	i purchased this fry pan in june of this year and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all clad but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer and a small fraction of the cost after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food ick ! i love the uncoated all clad but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future	20
1	this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri ply line is fantastic great weight and balance superb craftsmanship the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all the pricing is terrific i have all clad and yes it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less and it is still made in u s a	20
1	completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter from england so used a lot for cups of tea have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price m william	20
1	i bought this heater to head my bedroom finished basement the room is 16'x21' with 9 food ceilings the heater does a fantastic job at heating the room though takes a while \( 1 hour \) to do so which is fine with me i really like the fact that it is dead quiet and has a convienent lcd timer my only complaint is that it is rather large long	20
0	i bought this item at my local target the weekend i moved into my new apartment the parts are quality chrome and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye if only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture one of the shelves does n't fit properly over the four legs and the finished product sways at the slightest touch judging by the glowing reviews on this page at best this product is a hit or miss venture there 's a reason it 's priced at 30 dollars buyer beware	20
1	works great bought for making candle tarts and it did n't let me down i would recommend this hot plate for any use	20
0	it seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth it spit cereal all over the place i used special k and kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears ! i returned it	20
0	hopefully i will never make this kind of mistake	20
1	i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i'm sure money well spent	20
0	i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u s a they are very thin and cheap i do not recommend anyone buying them you willonly want to return them	20
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party it was the talk of the whole school the kids loved it i used sephra chocolate \( a coupon was included \) so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression the cascading flowing chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine i also saved 25 00 by buying the chp \( champaigne color \) version	20
0	within 2 weeks the pause brew did n't exist the coffee poured all over when i tried to pull the carafe for a cup my attempts at fixing it were for naught what a waste of money ! i'm not one who returns items i just wo n't buy braun again !	20
0	i'm a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover 's delight it turned out to be my biggest nightmare it takes a lot to set it up and get it started if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place boy what a mess it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy took up way to much room on my counter i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good if not better it 's small easy to run and the coffee tastes great deb in new hampshir	20
1	easy to use and easy to clean and storem look online for jerky recipie	20
0	product worked well for several months providing sufficient heating for moderate sized space however heater now only provides heat for approximately 1 2 minutes after turning on then sparks and the heating mechanism fails dangerous for a space heater no	20
1	i bought a pack of 3 for my purifier this filter does a good job and keeps the watrer tasting good	20
0	the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again	20
0	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end also i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere !	20
1	the electrolux sweeper that uses these bags is very expensive and so are the bags if i had known that i could only purchase these online i may have chosen another vacuum system but on the bright side the sweeper works very well and the bags are not too challenging to put on and remove	20
0	this is not a good product it is not a very flixible plastic and breaks easily if dropped or flexed it is also not large enough for some dishes and microwaves nordicware does make a more flexible cover but the advertising for this one is not very clear about features	20
1	i just recieved this a few days ago and it really works great i purchased this for using with my non stick cookware and it works like a dream i made alfredo sauce and it thoroughly mixed everything with no problems and the cheese did n't stick at all great item as well as product line	20
0	poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and could n't purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it 's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker	20
0	these are more like 200 250 thread count soft at first but after a couple of washings they feel rough loose their shape and wrinkle easily i purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment	20
0	i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world and look at all the different types of knives not worth it these knives do n't cut well at all \( as compared to my henckel knife \) i wish i did n't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives also the block holder is huge ! it takes up too much space	20
0	i returned the item because it fell apart as i was attempting to put it together cheap compressed wood by products and card board even though i did receive a full refund after it was returned i would not recommend it to anyone else i was able to find a solid wood and better made shelf from another vendor	20
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she did n't keep the receipt so i'm writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries i do n't buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands	20
0	i'm sending it back immediately no where in the description of the product did it say it was plastic and i do n't feel i should be charged for return postage	20
0	i dont recoment you to buy this product i dont under stand why they made i	20
1	i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used \( and washed ! \) on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try	20
1	i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one	20
1	this mug is microwave and dishwasher safe a great mug for a large cup of cocoa or coffee makes a great christmas gift for a cat lover	20
0	i wish i had read the customer reviews before purchasing this my wife just tried to use our kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries do not purchase this egg slicer ! it is a waste of 10	20
1	i absolutely love this decanter i have had two others one very expensive one inexpensive both without handles while very elegant they were a nightmare to clean and pour they both broke well good riddance ! this is the best decanter large surface area angled mouth and indespensable handle i have received compliments every time i use it while entertaining i am ordering several more for gifts i am positive they will please all who receive them perfect	20
1	very loud and heavy i have used lighter and less noisy vacuums in the past this one does pick up hair and lint very well seems to deep clean for the price it was a good deal	20
0	the scale does not come with a battery even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it all of this i can live with the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself when turned on it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds i timed it 40g for one minute \( and after hours just keep on going \) the box had no signs of damage so i'm guessing the load cell was bad very disappointing	20
0	we ordered one of these racks and it was ok then we ordered another one and one of the pieces was bent making it impossible to contruct target replaced it and the replacement was similarly defective not worth the hassle of going back and forth to the post office	20
1	gorgeous unique useful ! i bought this as a gift and it is the recepient 's favorite great gift do not hesitate buy now !	20
1	this pitcher is the perfect size for entertaining it makes a lovely appearance and is light weight i had one in crystal and this is much better additionally it 's a breeze to clean 5 stars all around appearance weight capacity ease of cleaning and price !	20
1	put these next to the riedel glasses and they show very nicely considering they are half the price	20
0	i have just used this spinner for the first time in a long while now i remember why i avoid it it is nearly impossible to get the top and spinning basket to mesh and at the same time get the top with the handle to fit onto the bottom part the very few times that all has gone together and stayed long enough to get a good grip on the bottom the greens have come out nice and dry otherwise it 's an exercise in frustration ! i hope that mine is defective or something because otherwise i must say pass this one by and find a different design or model and test it in a store before you buy it	20
0	the legs were a bit tricky to put down and when i did i busted the mounts never even used this thing threw it away coleman makes one that i bought that 's better built and excalibur electronics has one available as well that i also bought i like excalibur 's better but both are better than this piece of junk all 3 brands are in the same price range interestingly there are n't a lot of portable ac dc fan options out there i bought these for camping in florida	20
1	this is absolutely hands down the best toy we 've gotten for our dogs we own three sets of these in varying sizes because the balls are plush they will wear out this is not for your destructive chewers our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day before leaving for work pop a couple of treats inside and you 're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks	20
1	they really do work as advertised they go right into drywall \( be careful not to hit a stud however ! \) with no muss and no fuss i have n't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds but for basic home picture hanging etc they really do work as advertised	20
0	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan	20
0	it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits	20
1	i am a boy when i bouhgt this stuff it was the first time live without my family i do not know the cookwre set but my female friends always say where did get it \? or it look really expensive they alway said it 's good and reasonable price	20
1	i have found this to be a very good product and easy to use i would give it a 5 star rating if all the removable parts could be washed in a dishwasher i can't see why they could not be	20
0	i have had this scale for about 4 months it worked fine the few times i used it but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost i swapped batteries and still nothing the connection for the 9v battery is very loose and even after crimping and holding it tight it did n't get any juice not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets so maybe i just got a lemon	20
0	as you can see in the picture the pestle \( the part you hold in your hand \) has quite a wide bottom unfortunately this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location making it practically impossible to grind seeds \( e g cumin \) to dust i tried it once on cumin seeds and gave up	20
0	it 's noisy and expensive you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page ours stopped working within 2 weeks of light use i called the company and when i described the problem they said it was a faulty unit thankfully the store let me return it and i got my money back we have bought the hamilton beach trueair 04381 allergen reducer air cleaner which is cheaper smaller and very quiet most importantly it works ! ! !	20
0	the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good	20
0	a very impressive looking oven the temperature dial did not reflect the actual internal temperature of the oven by 50 to 75 degrees once i got that sorted out the oven worked well about 20 times then the motor started to sputter on and off burning electrical odor filled the air and an arcing sound could be heard while it worked it worked well i do not know if the defect is common or rare i tested only one oven	20
0	this tool is very poorly made when grating cheese the handle tended to twist in the hand making it difficult to control and causing discomfort with medium pressure during use caused the drum to dent ! returned cuisipro grater strongly dissatisified ! looks good but a piece of junk	20
1	the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material	20
0	why do most of us buy sharper image \? most of the times their products work well and they look great this heater looked great in the picture it ends there i bought three thinking i would keep one for myself and two for friends there 's no way i would give this to a friend maybe a stranger whom i did n't care about giving the wrong impression pros it 's small con it looks cheap it feels cheap it does n't work at all if it did n't have the sharper image logo on it i would guess that it was a 5 dollar clearance item at walgreens	20
1	i just bought my second one the first alarm hangs in our kitchen and does go off with a nice loud alarm when i seriously scorch dinner it 's easy to turn off with the huge button in front no false alarms here only goes off when there is smoke nearby	20
0	the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i'm almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though	20
0	after 6 weeks of waiting customer service said it was going to be another 3 weeks ! forget it ! cancelled order	20
0	sheets are full of wrinkles after being washed not as soft as when new and not the qualiy i anticipated	20
0	the sheets and comforter in this set are very scratchy and stiff and you can see right through the sheets i would not recommend the set very poor quality i do n't even use the sheets on my son 's bed because they seem so uncomfortable	20
0	sent it back could n't see the read out with a plate or saucer on the scale needs a tilted or canted face	20
1	these hangers were exactly what i was looking for at a great price ! they 're the first hangers i 've purchased in a long time that do n't leave bumps in the sleeves of my clothing i would recommend these hangers	20
0	this as a new and improved zyliss press it does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a nonstick surface it is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing the holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick difficult and time consuming i have sent multiple e mails to zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions zyliss does not respond the companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative do n't buy their products	20
0	this is a hollow ground blade \( not flat ground \) which does not cut straight the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this get a knife with a flat ground blade not this one you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade it is a cheaper way to make knives	20
1	this lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting the serving bowl is much larger than i anticipated and great for tossing space the individual bowls are also deep this is a great set for salad lovers	20
1	this vase is beautiful i'm considering purchasing the matching hostess pieces to complete the set	20
1	blinds were what i expected they were very good quality and low price too shipping was excellent and on time	20
0	unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i 'd suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i 've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you 'll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you 'll have trouble turning it not recommended	20
0	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater	20
0	the writeup is incorrect this does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200 while returning it is not difficult through amazon it means a trip to ups and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement	20
0	too expensive too little heat unit quit after a year of intermittent use i wo n't buy vornado again	20
1	great product too bad the shipping cost as much as the produc	20
0	mazon i ordered 4 for xmas dinner was sent three and they cancelled the 4th one saying the will never get it in thanks amazon	20
1	the plastic top has no vents thereby producing rubbery boiled tasting popcorn easily solved ! i drilled about a dozen 1 8 inch holes in the top \( bottom \? \) of the plastic bowl and voila ! wonderful crispy crunchy popcorn	20
0	we are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster the bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside i sent email to west bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck no help if i return it shipping cost makes it not worth it good appearance and company name fooled me fy	20
0	works good except for with the cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly but makes great coffee	20
1	i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly at first but after only about 6 weeks of use the flip up spout broke off actually just broke in half i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good	20
0	i could not believe it was for only one cup i did not read throughly and thought it was for four big dissapointment	20
0	i returned this item because it was too big for the brother es2000 sewing machine i bought it was very bulky and took up way too much room the machine rattled inside the case and slipped around it would probably be better for a larger machine	20
1	this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble ! this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 's fit just fine ! this shoe rack is perfect i highly reccomend it !	20
0	first the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner that can be overlooked but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability i may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks no matter what setting i put it on horrible to say the least i sent it back and purchased a new one which i enjoy to this day	20
0	this product does not pick up dirt on laminate flooring at all which was not my impression when it was advertised	20
1	my girlfriend received this kettle last christmas and it 's still working i even use it at times so easy to use fill it up 3 4 of the way with water and push down the red tab thingy nice and hot in 30 45 seconds a minute for larger cup full	20
1	the my pod and its filters work great in my senseo now i do n't have to buy the expensive pods all the time the only problem is i have to shut it off manually as it wo n't sense it is full and shut itself off	20
1	the stool is excellent quality looks good and works well the surprise is the weight very heavy	20
1	these are gorgeous bowls they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking i am very satisfied with them no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily and they look fantastic on my pot rack	20
1	i was looking for an quot offset serrated knife quot as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights	20
1	i have found this item to be very helpful i only have 1 arm and dust pans are not an option now when i spill something i can clean it up on my own	20
1	i gave it as a gift she loved it since the granite roaster she had for over 20 years had gotten a small hole in the bottom from so much use	20
0	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had the third time i used it the belt broke with each use my back would start hurting the forward motion was very easy but pulling it back was hard i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it	20
1	i'm impressed with the quality of these towels i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally they are large soft absorbent towels	20
0	i have been searching for a baster with an injector this one looked good it works ok with the injector but it does not work at all as a regular baster i guess i will keep searching	20
1	this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container	20
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it its the perfect size to make pancakes eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles college students and anyone who likes great things in small packages	20
0	this is the most poorly designed machine i have ever seen it is continually clogging both filters and the hepa filter becomes filled with dirt quickly causing loss of all suction i replaced it with the dyson dc17 which is awesome do not buy this vacuum	20
0	this is a great sweeper but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty since then we have replaced it five times \( we really got our money 's worth from the warranty at least ! \) it 's getting to be a joke one day \( usually 2 3 months after we bring home the new one \) the rotor just stops turning and that 's all she wrote next time we will purchase a different sweeper warranty or not	20
1	i need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price plus 6 napkins both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and i threw them straight into the washer they are 55 cotton and 45 polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free i am very happy with these basic table linens i like the price too made in pakista	20
0	the can opener does not swing tight and once installed kept swinging out instead of staying stowed i bought it because it was so highly rated but i am very disappointed there is no magnet to hold the can lid either although it was intended to save space it is kind of a clunky eyesore	20
0	the rainbow 600 count egyptian sheets were so irregular that the seams on the pillowcases were not square i returned them	20
1	i spray my foods with olive oil using this wonderful sprayer it 's great to use if you want to avoid the unhealthy chemicals you get in the spray cans off the shelf just poor in your favourite olive oil	20
1	i owned this dispenser for close to a year and love it the cereal is always fresh and accessible and i do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack great design	20
0	while this vacuum is easy to use it loses suction after only 6 months do n't buy this to waste money	20
0	one should n't have to empty water out after every use one should n't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware ca n't even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details	20
0	we ordered a cherry coat rack \( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item \) and it came as light oak i tried to get it exchanged but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause it wasnt their fault i dont know whose fault it is but i ordered a cherry i got something totally different and their customer service didnt service me and wasnt customer friendly never again	20
1	we love this item it 's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them they look cute in the kitchen too !	20
1	this is the nicest pie dish i 've ever seen i dont even make pies but i got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things it 's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too the color is deep and rich i got the cobalt i will find a place to display this dish it 's so pretty got one for my friend too she loves it as much as i do at 20 00 and free shipping you gotta try this ! maybe i 'll even try a pie	20
1	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well	20
0	this is junk the blades tore through the plastic with the first potato i tried to slice the apple slicer broke on the 4th apple the blades are not sharp and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything the julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder though i do think any attachment would be able to slice brie and if not that then perhaps jello worst purchase i ever made with the name kitchenaid on it	20
1	immediately became my favorite skillet cooks evenly cleans up easily only wish it also came in the 12 size	20
0	for the price i expected a quality canister the plastic insert in the lid arrived unglued and hardly creates an airtight seal had i seen this item in a store i would have passed on it immediately	20
0	did not work right out of the box the heating elements did not get hot so i had to return it otherwise i would be throwing money away do not buy	20
1	this duvet set is soft and easily launderable looks great and feels even better fits over my overstuffed down comforter	20
0	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away	20
0	i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer	20
0	we were very disappointed upon opening the package to see how small the glasses are i was concerned about this when i purchased them but could find no info on size \( and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are \( 2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1 4 inches tall i can hide the entire glass in my closed fist \)	20
0	saw the other review and had to share my similar experience the glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing it 's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings i have to return it because i know will get angry every time i pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess	20
1	the best product ever ! i have 5 cats and let me tell you if it were n't for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago \( or i 'd just have a very stinky household ! \) have used it for a long time and will continue to do	20
0	short and not so sweet first unit did not work at all second unit worked for about 3 months then sporatically then quit i should have believed the other reviewers going to try the senseo supreme unit now	20
0	this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well but this one came out of the box warped the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy with only one strip through the center that made contact i could return it but for 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box i would never use it again	20
0	not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money	20
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided much smaller than anticipated i can only fit a tablespoon in it	20
1	locally one box of 5 runs about 2 3 of the cost of this case lot of 5 boxes a terrific savings	20
0	not as addd says its just a sheet of material that comes it must be cut to fit and is not ehat one would maybe want to do !	20
1	i have used this vacuum only on carpet as i bought it for my finished basement suction is very powerful it is quiet and the dirt cup is so easy to empty the cup is designed so that you push a lever and it empties from the bottom very clever and so easy and clean it is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot other nice features include a very long cord and great looks ! the most important thing is suction and this baby is powerful ! ! it 's amazing what this thing picks up overall extremely pleased with this vacuum !	20
0	i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail	20
1	i really love the litter locker the price ca n't be beat at amazon so get them here for sure most pet stores will charge you twice that	20
1	this is a good pet bed and a bargain for the prize seems to be well made very puffy my dog was trying to pound it down before laying on it i love the round shape have always had rectangles but this fits the area better and seems to provide plenty of laying room for the dog	20
1	this claims to be 100 cotton but my girlfriend who is n't allergic to cotton broke out in insane hives all over her body we figured it was the blanket because we did n't use it on some days and one day it was horrible she was using that only it 's probably cursed by the devil aside from this it 's nice soft and also light enough to use as a summer blanket which i plan on doing	20
1	i bought this for my husband 's birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that do n't keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee	20
0	i have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and i have a lot of experience peeling vegetables i am fast and have rarely cut myself however i bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago i cut myself so severly with it i thought about going to the hospital this peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others i have used and so it some how gives me an quot out of control quot feeling with each thrust it is also extra sharp i ca n't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well	20
0	the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface 100ft would be pushing it	20
0	we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one	20
1	this is a big saucepan ! i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines this has become my favorite pot for many things from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night the see through lid is great for monitoring food as it 's cooking and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look and i love it	20

0	worst product ever do n't know how it passed through initial testing when you turn the crank to dispense cereal it crushes it and sprays it all over the room awful just awful too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash waste of money and space and we tried dog food which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck really made me angry that i wasted the money false advertising	20
0	i am sure there is a lesson in my experience i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt pepper did not go where i wanted it i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube i am sad to say that i again found it 's performance to be a big disappointment	20

1	the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now with no problems to speak of we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily and each time it has been very good a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided the provided tamper is plastic and can be wobbly but i am very satisfied with the product	20

0	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it 's simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday	20
0	i bought this belgiam waffle maker 30 days ago it worked fine for 30 days and then the iron stopped heating up i contacted villaware and they suggested getting amazon com to replace the unit which they did time will tell on the replacement	20

0	if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat \( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic \) pros1 reduces tracking somewhat2 more attractive than other litter mats3 does n't take up too much spacecons1 my cat does n't like it most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet2 it 's too smal	20
0	if you are looking for a plastic box that rotates then look no further if you are looking for a space heater keep looking	20
0	i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal so i bought these as replacements the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal the rubber sections on these are so thin that they did n't even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on all three stoppers in the set had the same problem oxygen and leakage are death to a wine so a stopper that does n't seal is worse than just replacing the cork	20
1	i am potty training my son so i needed a good waterproof mattress pad but did n't want to spend a lot of money this fits the bill it 's lightweight but sturdy and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress and held up well in the wash so far has a nice feel and it does n't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do our mattress is old and thin by today 's standards but the pad seems roomy enough that i think if we got a new thick mattress it would still work very pleased with this purchase	20
0	i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before but the picture on the site and the product review looked good when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time	20
1	being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars ! \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine	20
1	my mom has arthritis in her hands pretty bad most peelers are difficult to impossible for her to use not this one it works flawlessly it is easy to hold in her hand and the blade is sharp enough to do a great job on potatos and carrots	20
0	this item comes with many warnings as it should it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house	20
1	we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it 's a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter	20
1	this dish rack fits into small spaces and holds a decent capacity of plates etc perfect for a small apartment kitchen ! love it !	20
0	see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning cool design but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press i only used this coffee maker 3 times and reverted to the press	20
0	i did n't get this order did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf number and when the credit was given	20

1	i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try it does a perfect job ! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago this one is more streamlined and improved the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups	20
0	they look nice but the towels do not absorb much water i am very disappointed i suspect i 'll use them a few times then give them to goodwill	20
1	this is great ! easy set up dishwasher safe \( top shelf only \) and super quiet \( there is a very faint humm \) our cats went right over to check it out it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher 5 stars ! ! ! i 'd give it more if i could	20
1	sturdy well made spatula perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks for the price you just ca n't go wrong	20
0	i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush unfortunetly it is just messy annoying and takes up counter space when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction if the cereal is too big \( honeycomb size \) it does n't come out easily if it is too small \( fruity pebbles \) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere ! i definetly would not buy this product again at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter	20
0	this filter is not in my estimation any good it leaves a sediment and the end product the coffee tastes terrible use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee	20
1	yep i had some 20 year old revere ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem and the lid from the pan fit the steamer it 's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes and probably more exactly what i needed and the price was good too	20

0	i have the black version but i'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model from day one it has n't been able to toast anything evenly be it frozen fresh refrigerated bread bagel english muffin you name it if you do n't believe me see the photo i uploaded the toast is burnt and raw at the same time	20

1	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20

1	this stock pot is enamel on steel not cast iron it was never meant to be no reason for any confusion i 've had mine for 5 years there are no chips or scratches no matter what i 've made spaghetti sauce posole or any kind of soup nothing has ever burned nor has the enamel come away from the pot turn the heat down i always get perfect results lecreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and does n't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some i 've read above	20
1	it 's as absorbent as advertised and the color is much better than the photos	20
1	i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses my wife can even use it without burning stuff which she admits is a feat for her so she uses it several times a week too it holds heat well cleans up easy and the lip on the corner works great for draining only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove with gas you should be fine it has n't seemed to effect the performance though and for the money it is quite perfect	20
1	i have these on my bed right now they are wonderful i am not quite sure what the complaints are about i got these in a gold color and they are wonderful yes they get wrinkled but i put them on my bed when they are still hot out of the dryer and spray then with a wrinkle releaser when i put them on the matress i love them i have a 20 wide matress and they fit so nicely ! for the thread count the price is right ! i am sure that you will enjoy these as much as i do	20
1	there is n't much you can say about a sharpening steel it sharpens well and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest the handle is ugly gray plastic but it seems solidly put together and is easy to work with	20
1	best investment i have ever made in cookware heats evenly more thoroughly and burns less amazingly tough and the best part is i do n't have to hunt for special plastic utensils to mix and stir this is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean i love it !	20
1	i bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas i do n't think she has used it yet but i'm sure i did n't go wrong with a kitchenaid product i currently own the hand mixer and large mixer and love them both prices on amazon ca n't be beat	20
1	i almost did n't purchase these because of the reviews but my son likes thomas so i did i was expecting really rough but i do n't think they are all that bad maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material anyway the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly	20
1	i use this in my 29 gallon and the filter is excellent the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in it is also very quiet however when the power goes out and comes back on it wo n't begin working again you must add water to it to get it up and running this has been a problem when i 've gone on vacation and i 've come home to cloudy water the refills are also pretty expensive and can get a bit messy it 's all worth it though it keeps my tank in nice condition	20
1	this is one of the prettiest shades fiestaware has put out i would like to see them put out a bright shade of pink as well	20
0	i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink black and white almost every buyer complained all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red black blue white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers	20
1	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable clean up is a breeze i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces	20
0	this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing it is luke cold ! i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave ! it is hard to clean and very loud	20
0	not the best sheet experience my legs broke out in a rash best to wash before using i guess the thread count is a bit lacking too for microfiber sheets i want a cloud like surface i will go for a higher priced item next time	20
0	i was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer i have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were i bought them because i liked the color and the red is a very pretty bright color i would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets or dry them on low heat the material of the sheets is fairly thin so i am not sure how long they will last	20
1	i got this to replace my bulky turner that i got from the dollar store for 1 00 for an extra 3 or so i got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me also the turner part looks plastic but i guess it 's silicone or something because it does not melt also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat if washing by hand its easily washable too ! i have both the blue and green flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen	20
1	the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer 's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly	20
1	petsafe batteries are the best of course they are the only ones that work in the dog collar but they are still very good	20
1	the cheaper ones do n't quite fit unfortunate because these are so expensive which is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars i would give five for the product but the price really is outrageous they know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers \( hamilton beach not amazon \) too bad the makers of these machines do n't have the users in mind instead of their bank accounts they take advantage of people who need these humidifiers	20
0	this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it 's light and relatively shabby in construction it 's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited	20
0	just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back even on maximum setting it hardly toasts we tried different breads different settings and it just does n't work right we even tried toasting \( on maximum \) one lot of bread \( not good \) and followed it by another lot of bread \( better but not adequate \) on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread forget it on the up side the toaster looks good but for 80 it should toast better than my old 9 99 black and decker ! !	20
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no frills straight lined attractive furniture it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set i love it ! and the price is right too	20
0	i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money	20
1	this is the fourth piece of furntiure i have bought from this line \( mission natural \) i love it i have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center but use them as night stands it fits my 1950 's contemporary home perfectly price is great delivery even better i ordered on a saturday night and received it by tuesday noon i could n't ask for more	20

0	the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside between the sun and cold air the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top i have gone through 3 of them all with exactly the same results	20
1	i love that it has a mini bowl so much less storage also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach i am so impressed love kitchen aid anything	20
1	the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area which came out with laundering other than that the sheets are great the lace needs starch and ironing the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses these two beds are put together to make a king bed this product was a christmas gift and it was well received	20
0	i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around i promptly called amazon and they replaced it it was a waste of money the first time i washed them white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out i was very very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again do n't waste your money	20
0	the heater that i received was defective i down loaded a return label from amazon com and returned the heater i received my refund very quickly i have two other delonghi heaters of a different model that i am very happy with but are no longer manufactured this was my first experiance with this particular model	20
1	we were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it but we are really glad we decided to buy it ! so far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around ! and believe me we live in a mountainy area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage i have not seen them ever since we bought this product it is working for us	21
1	the companion group works to create new and innovative barbecue accessories that exceed expectations being the first to produce the compartmentalized grill basket means we have a learning curve to balance out before attaining perfection we have identified improvements including a simple insertion mechanism for the detachable handle and have stream lined the compartment lids for easy opening and shutting these adjustments have made for superior functionality making this a product we are proud to call part of the steven raichlen line we sincerely apologize and would encourage anyone who received the unsatisfactory product to call our customer service manager \( 800 521 0505 ext 3512 \) and we will replace the item at no additional charge	21
0	order was shipped very quickly i will keep item advertised hanging hardware and swivel not included chair could easily fray cotten ends are only taped not knotted no way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised i should have read advertisement closer i could have gotten 100 cotten chair for less this ad did n't state the material used i could buy from this company again i 'll just pay closer attention	21
0	the editorial review states its big enough for two heads to rest on it it would be more informative if you stated the dimensions of the pillow !	21
1	this is compact and fairly accurate i use it inside my bedroom to check humidity levels and it is quite helpful would recommend ti to anyon	21
1	like all cast iron cookware not preseasoned preseasoning is an absolute must i use this product with the bayou classic single burner it makes awsome eggs bacon and grilled cheese whatever with lots of space for cooking a bunch at once great for camps or just in the backyard for fun	21
1	the cover is easy to put on and take off it covers completely and has a very sturdy feeling to it it 's a great value ! i would recommend highly	21
1	this is in excellant condition and came in a timely manner	21
0	after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	21
1	thermometer works fine holds up in extremes temps and conditions i wish it reached farther but when within range a nice satellit	21
1	the cover is exactly what i needed to protect our smoker from the weather it is strong and appears to be durable i felt that the price was fair for this product	21

1	i sent this to my in laws foy christmas and they loved it ! ! they recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks i am told it is quite comfortable as well	21
0	i bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month one night i saw a mouse running across my stove so i brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop later that evening i was washing dishes and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of shake'n'bake right past the rodent repellant five times ! !	21

1	i bought this grill for my husband even though we already had a weber i thought he might appreciate the added features this one offers i was right he raves about it every time he uses it !	21
0	the third time i used this brush it broke the wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush a little before where the bristles start i now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire my other weber brush \( which i purchased at a diff website \) is still intact and works okay you see the bristles are a little gunked up that 's why i bought this second grill brush buyers and vampires beware	21
1	very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my weber spirit 500 grill took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button no more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy cold day	21
1	wonderful grill everything we expected shipping a problem showed up a week late sat at home for three different delivery dates before the shipper finally showed up grill was slightly damaged we elected to keep it rather than start the shipping hassles over again not sure the money we saved buying through amazon was worth it	21
1	my 15 year old son put the grill together while i was as work the grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls i have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures all items have come out great so far the stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time my last weber grill lasted for about 12 years i expect that this one will do as well or better my only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick connects like the last grill did it uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle	21
1	picked up the time signal within five minutes set your time zone and you 're in business no more guessing if you have the correct time no more resetting twice a year for dst large display characters are easy to read neutral design fits with most any decor i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed a full black circle is actually a full moon	21

1	the ws 9119u weather station monitors outside temp and humidity and inside temp and humidity further it monitors barometric pressure and make a gross prediction of weather change via pictoral representations of weather for the price it serves a function but it 's not an all encompasing scientific weather station most of which cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars this unit is good to observe outside weather conditions monitor inside conditions and monitor gross weather change for this it a a reliable and relatively inexpensive instrument	21
1	this cushion is extra long and extra thick and should work with most any chaise lounge it has really firm support not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season i highly recommend it	21
0	the product was as advertised easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since i installed it so far it does not appear to have affected the mole population however to be fair it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device \( instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil although the critters have dug quite close to it \) to be really bend over backwards fair i suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles although the telltale signs are exactly what i understand mole tunnels to look like	21
1	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21
1	i got my husband this hammock for father 's day and he loves it no complaints whatsoever	21
1	elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put oxo good grips on the grip map i bought this to complete my good grips bbq set the only thing it lacks that some bbq'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle but that does n't bother me seeing as i do n't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design if the dog does n't get ahold of it it will last a lifetime	21
1	excellent product my third experienced with oregon scientific products simple to set up and accurat	21
1	i gave the grill to my son and his wife as a housewarming present i think they 've cooked out every weekend since they love it	21
0	essentially a one season lightweight hibachi that does n't stand up to extended use so at 12 it 's too expensive but may be worth about 5	21
1	a very nice thermometer very simple to use to read and pretty accurate for a thermometer of this price at least it is more accurate than the local weather company made in china try to do n't drop it something that could be kind of annoying is that every 3 seconds the lcd will display the hour and after those 3 seconds will display the temperature if it does n't botter you \( like me \) you should buy it i tested it in temperatures from 15 c to 25 c and works fine 1 year warranty in the us and canada	21
1	i did buy this grill in a store and now that i search amazon for acessories i find that it is a lot cheaper here it is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking many parts are not as sturdy corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as i would expect	21
1	we did have one of these items before and ours was just at the end of it 's life so the only place we ould find another one was through weber we love it	21
1	never failed on me ! it realy works ! i was not a believer before i tryed it it worked great from the first try ! before that i used a special jelee to start my b b q charcoal i 'll do it never ever again ! this chimney is great	21
0	the picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is \( by a long shot \) it does not screen out unwanted pests birds and harsh sunlight well maybe birds but certainly not bugs or light there are large gaps between each strand of beads and it 's completely see through this is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy on a positive note amazon made the return very easy	21
1	after much research and reading lots of reviews we chose this weber it is more expensive than others in its category but the high reviews and our past experience with weber and the warranty helped us make this our choice we love it so far we live on top of a hill and one of our concerns was the wind well the grill performs superbly ! even on a cold \( 40 degrees \) and windy day it heated up in less than 10 mintues	21
1	one of the most comfy chairs i own just delightful to sit outside on the patio i love my chair in fact i 've got two i ca n't say anything more then these are beautiful relaxing comfy chairs	21
1	this thing works great i prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so i never had a chance to make beer can chicken the chicken i cooked came out perfect crispy skin and juicy inside excellent ! i'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time the bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean highly recommended	21
0	bought the driveway patrol and had nothing but problems with it it constantly went off no matter how many times i moved it around also when a car drove into the driveway sometimes it would n't go off ! ! ! talked to the telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back they replaced it free however it worked just as bad as the first one now they refuse to refund my money ! ! this product is an absolute ripoff and i would n't recommend it to my worst enemy i agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars ! ! i suggest you beware of any other products you might want from telebrands	21
0	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
1	i received the chia herb garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start but most of the plants are still going strong i have more chives and parsley than i know what to do with these are also some of the tastiest herbs that i 've ever eaten	21
1	i use this along with the 807 bbq fork for the bbq and the smoker i use the bbq fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting the lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light the alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached the silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free	21
1	what a pleasure to put together ! ! it took me 1hr to assemble all the parts were there and i dide n't need assistance just leaned it against the wrought iron rail of the patio and presto ! ! i was enjoing a fire in no time !	21
0	i purchased a 40 wt stinger insect killer from home depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months since it was near the end of the season i decided to store it and replace the bulb when i put it out in the spring the bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently insects also clogged it after a couple of days i gave up on it and recently purchased a flowtron bk 40 and it works great do n't waste your money buy a flowtron instead \( my last flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb \)	21
0	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
1	this storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside it was easy to put together and i got it on the friday sale for 69 99 so the price was awesome ! all other benches like this that i researched were over 100 0	21
1	i purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser \( selling at football games \) it came out to about 06 cents per piece what several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace \( there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that \) the combined price of 18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at oriental trading \( 1 00 each \) and you ca n't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace would recommend these for kids birthday parties fundraiser church parties etc	21
0	i called weber to verify the basket fits my genesis silver b model and weber factory customer service informed me this item does not fit my model which they had registered and knew what model i was referencing the guidance on many weber accessories is incorrect according to what weber customer service reps are telling customers either weber cs is wrong or the weber person filling in the detail on the items is wrong i strongly suggest weber managment cross check all detail on amazon for accuracy and or straighten out their service reps this was a bad experience and occurred on multiple accessories i was trying to buy	21
1	i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm this one 's lots better ! the projection feature works ok though does n't really focus sharply at the close distances i 'd prefer to use the eight minute snooze alarm is great just the right interval ! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock	21
1	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
1	everyone who walks in to my room where i have this clock sitting comments on and wants to know where i got it this is one of my favorite things	21
1	i 've had one of these for years and bought them for gifts several times they work great	21
0	when my house painter could n't figure out how to use the nozzle he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts i looked everywhere on line for a replacement part but could not find anything finally i called hozelock in new york and they sent me a replacement part they charged me about 6 for shipping a part that cost about 3 the system ca n't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler also it is hard to reel the hose in overall i do n't think this item is worth the cost if you need to call hozelock their number is 1 800 297 7461	21
1	used it tonight for the first time made 5 pizzas with an average cook time 8 minutes bottom was a golden brown with very even cooking a very good simple design faster than a real brick oven bob pratl gloucester mass	21
1	just received this and think it will turn out to be a great table bought the bench and matching chairs they are a great set	21
0	do n't waste your money \( even just 10 bucks \) the plastic is not rip stop and tears very easily i will now just use a big heavy duty black trash can liner they are much stronger	21
1	unfortunately i wanted a spatula and wok to use in the house not outside therefore i just recently returned it but it was great !	21
1	this is the only feeder that attracts hummingbirds to our door we had birds eating right at the glass slider on the front deck all summer long ! the birds loved it and my family did too	21

1	easy to read accurate enough for the girls we date and cheap	21
0	i do n't own this clock but i do own one of it 's sister clocks the tambour style mantel clock and it did not change for dst now that the date has changed even though i 've owned my clock for all of a month and a half river city cuckoo clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect since i would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics i would be very wary about buying this clock	21
1	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
1	after having my silver b for 7 years the origional porcelin bars were very rusty my grill would flare up terribly i thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse i was right ! these stainless units \( the length is listed wrong here \) are great ! i just cooked brauts without a flare up ! price was great thanks amazon	21
1	bought this for my apartment have two remote sensors one in the bedroom and one between a window and the outside screen for outside temps works flawless and gives the same temp outside as it shows up on the weather channel ! humidity reading is great too as its led me to buy a humidifier for the dry months all in all a good product	21
0	it arrived fast enough but i should have sent the chair back it 's pretty cheaply made the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape it 's ok but i 'll keep my eyes open for a better one and we wo n't swing on it i do n't think it would take it	21
0	i received a gift certificate in mid december for my birthday ordered this item the shipping date was pushed out several times this week it was bumped again with the expected possible date to ship now april 29 very disappointed i never received it i see so many others received it and have great reviews where was mine \?	21
0	i recently bought the stinger uv15 it worked well for one month ! in that month i followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs but does n't kill them this product is not worth the money	21
0	i tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some i didnot see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes actually thereseemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed i did try different locations perhaps they are attracted to it but they are not being sucked in looking at the tray it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects	21
1	fun gift that works great ! ! ! ! after receiving one to give i ordered one for myself	21
0	i read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing so it 's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing ! i was hopeful the product would work for me i 've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard all with the same result mounds of dirt leading right up to the molechaser ! they seem attracted to it not turned off by it i only wish i could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device ! this product has done nothing to discourage moles voles etc in all three locations the lawn damage continues do n't make the same mistake i did look for another solution rather than this product	21
1	nice stand paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements but is n't peeling or exposing any metal there are 3 segments they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending but they 're freely attached so if you need to move your hammock stand you 'll need 2 people unless you push it if you pull it one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar you could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom \( horizontal \) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt but the steel is very thick about 3 16 quot or 1 4 quot thick	21
1	i needed a nice bench for the entry but did n't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so i stumbled upon this one and i love it ! ! ! ! it 's well made and the cushion is very plush ! the colors are perfect ! love it ! if you are looking for a nice and classy bench this is it	21
0	of 12 batteries i purchased 2 of them were leaking in the box i would rate these higher except that i also purchased 20 aaas and 12 of them were leaky i imagine i was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices i paid 4 99 4 pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive \( whick may not be very likely \)	21
1	we bought this for an intelligent 95 year old woman who wanted lots of information at her finger tips she knows immediately the date time day of the week and weather prediction it is very ugly but does the job perfectly ! !	21
1	this is a great fire pit for the money it is deep and secure no fear of the fire getting loose it also doubles as a bbq great buy for the money	21
1	i am using the product for my charbroil grill caddy it is a decent fit however with the colder weather the material has become more stiff we 'll have to see how it weathers over the cold months	21
1	they are handsome and nicer than i expected by far the fabric has a really nice quality strong pleasantly textured durable and a fine rich color they 're handsome well stitched and sturdy very comfortable and are holding up to the sun some rain too i must admit these were a terrific deal	21
1	i bought one for my girlfriend over a few years ago it sets itself and projects the time on the ceiling in a soft red this is an amazing feature no more getting up or turning your head to check the time it makes the sleep experience much more comfortable	21
0	aside from the nifty weather prediction this clock is completely impractical the projection numbers are about 1 2 inch tall with minimal clarity the clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible i am surprise this is sold on amazon thank goodness for amazon 's customer friendly returning policy i think amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good	21
1	i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars	21
0	there oughta be a law i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
1	i purchased my oregon scientific station 8 years ago the internal sensor batteries need changed annually and i 've changed the rechargeables outside once i live in georgia and we get lots of sun other than needing to reset the unit about every 6 months \( gets confused by near lightning strikes but then what wireless electronics do n't \? \) and perhaps not the high precision rain gauge i 'd like to have it 's more than adequate for any home weather enthusiast	21
1	someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag it is not it is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	21
1	have had this grill for 8 or 9 years unbelievable great product have a 2nd house on miss river used almost year round atleast twice a week have never had a problem highly recommend if like charcoal opposed to gas	21
1	i love it ! it 's a bit of work to maintain but it 's an awesome grill that cooks everything \( once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book \) i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it 's a at a quarter tank it 's worth the price	21
1	this grill cover is much nicer than the weber standard cover i have the 18 1 2 and ca n't imagine that the 22 1 2 is much different what i really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing again it looks nice all black stitching virtually invisible and a nice weber logo after a couple nights left in the rain the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather	21
1	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
1	we received one of these chairs as a gift from our daughter several years ago it has been a great conversation piece besides being a very comfortable chair the grandkids argue over who 's turn it is to use it it is very relaxing to sit in it on the patio on a nice summer evening and read or watch the sunset	21
1	i did a lot of research and if you follow directions it is safe and fun it takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb turkey the pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird the turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering watch the oil temp so it does not go over 350 do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells	21
1	been using the bar388hga bk for about a month now appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier \( who 's hygrometer is way off \) automatic atomic clock is cool too highly recommend	21
1	great product durable and quality stitching worth its price to protect your grill	21
1	i expected that the burner would work just fine i was surprised at how easily the burner was installed the old one came out effortlessly and the new one went in just as easy had i known it was going to be so easy i would have done it two years ago	21
1	it works in new jersey just wait a night before you say something else	21
0	this product malfunctioned from the get go i was unable to get it working for that price it 's a shame you can purchase one of those multifuntionclock thermometer for less than 5 i would give this product 0 star	21
0	not the manufacturer 's fault i blame u s congress for this the clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier dst change this year there was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and or clock that we just returned the clocks disappointed	21
0	very nice alarm clock easy to set up but huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button very inconvenient ! ! ! !	21
1	i bought these because i'm always burning my arms when i remove bread from my oven these gloves cover my arms to the elbow and are flexible enough to allow me to handle bread pans easily the price is outstanding i saw the same thing at one of the chain home stores for 7 99 each	21
1	i gave it as a gift to my son and he likes it	21
0	80 for this \? seriously overpriced if you can find something cheaper buy it this is not worth 80 bucks clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping worked well with ribs	21
1	i have used flowtron products for years this year coud n't find one locally and purchased another brand ! lated one month andhad to replace the bulb the new bulb lasted less than a month total cost was twice that of a flowtron bk 40 the flowtron bk 40 will last one year 24 7 year around like a car weatherand age takes it 's toll but you 'll need to clean the deadcritters off every other week finally found a flowtron onamazon thanks no critters around my house big or small	21
1	we enjoy this firepit because it is unique and also doubles as a grill it is nice quality for the	21
0	a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts no comments whatsoever on the safety it seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at charbroil in the past we have used weber and got ten years from the grill i would look at the weber	21
1	keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord i bought a 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord and i'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature i got this cord at lowes and it cost around 18 dollars the manual says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can also thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out got to go my ribs are almost done	21
1	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
0	this item was a disapointment looks great in the picture but is cheaply made peices of the wicker were coming loose the item is also very short i am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches i guess you get what you pay for if you spend 800 1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this	21
0	i spent the extra on this alarm because i wanted a projection feature the projection feature lasted 2 weeks i also had a wall clock made by lacrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity save your money folks hopefully amazon will refund my	21
1	the brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then the brush has a strong wooden handle leather loop a sturdy set of bristles and a grill scraper for tough jobs be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12 inch one does not have the reach especially for larger grills	21
0	it does not like rapid changes in temperature when the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back all of that is moot because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors though it is a mere 45 degrees outside sent it back	21
1	i bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in i have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet so it is protected from the weather you can see it well from across the yard have had several comments from visitors they think its a great outdoor clock the thermometer is not automatically set you need to set it it seems to work fine i have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio tv would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece	21
1	i love having a sun tan and thus have had a variety of beach lawn lounge chairs over the years this on is by far the most comfortable and best built i recommend it highly	21
1	we own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean \( cobwebs ceiling fans windows etc \) that are out of reach we found this product online and it works great our kids even enjoy using it around the house each attachment is perfect for the task at hand i wish we bought it five years ago	21
1	this little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink it scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean sturdier than any other brush i or my family has used the one we have now has lasted quite a long time it cleans each rail on the grate beautifully the wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean	21
1	i recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases i can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes it was so easy i also like having the temputure show up i would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock	21
1	received after a weeks time per amazon this was supposed to be in stock and shipped immediately clock is working good there is no instruction maunal in the packag	21
1	i was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product i need to point out i am 5'4 i did need the assistance from my boyfriend \( who is 6'1 \) to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs but he did it and they are gone ! i just received my simple clean today and i have already tried three attachments the ceiling fan attachment worked well i used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting loved it ! we also used the spider web remover and it was great ! i recommend this product to everyone !	21

1	i purchased this prep station for my yard it is the nicest prep table i have seen for the price it is durable while still nice looking delivery was on time i did have a problem that some parts were missing from the box but they were replaced free of charge from the merchant	21
1	protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time this is by far the best grill cover we have had it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s 320 perfectly and it is heavyweight recommended definitely	21
1	this is a very nice cover it is heavy duty and vented at the rear of the top others say this cover fits tight and it does but i can get it on and off by myself the trick is since the cover is a little stiff you can hold it with one hand above the grill while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill then it slides down and fits properly it looks awesome really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' unkept grills ! \)	21
1	i bought this grill set for my fiance he absolutely loved them they are heavy and extremely sturdy i would definitely recommend them !	21
1	this remote temperature sensor works in conjunction with the base unit and permits you to monitor the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor temp anywhere in your house i keep the base unit in my bedroom and can then tell both the outdoor temp and the lower level indoor temps when getting dressed for the day i think the system works very well for a reasonable cost	21
1	this is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it 's hung on the wall the fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home the atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed i put the battery in it and that 's it it took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time but it 's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception i highly recommend this clock it is more than i expected	21

0	when i bought this product it was said to be new ! however upon opening the package it arrived in the cooker was in an already opened inner box i though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent \? as i opened the inner box one of the legs on the cooker was broken off and rusted ! i needed to use this right away so i did not send it back now i will have to get this leg welded back on ! beware of the new designation !	21
1	the item arrived about three weeks after it was ordered one of the pieces was damaged in shipment i called the customer support line a replacement part was shipped out to me at no charge the broken piece was to be discarded constuction was easy and quick \( 1 hour \)	21
0	as a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the sw i can say that red or any other color dye is nonsense ! not needed quite likely harmful also i question the instant nectar instructions say it does n't require boiling is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth \? if so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers it could harm their natural internal flora	21
1	this is great furniture folks many times i have thought that amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but i cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is ! i bought 4 chairs the settee and b c they do n't have a side table in the bainbridge pattern i bought the shaw table with the ice pit i have recommended these to everyone lol the price has gone up 10 every week for the past 2 weeks get em while their hot	21
1	this is my second smokey joe the first one \( about 11 years old \) really only needed the charcoal grate so i figured i 'd get a new grate and pass that one on to one of my children and have a new one for me although it 's relatively small in size i 've done 7 big burgers or 5 6 chicken breast quarters with smoked sausage at one time and it does n't require a big amount of charcoal to do the job after cleaning the cooking grate and the housing it now looks almost new would i recommend it you bet	21
1	while the 04' model of the performer is slightly pricier than the latest 05' model there is no comparision between the two models in terms of design function and useability if you want the best charcoal grill made your choice should be an 04' performer ! ! !	21
1	i 've used my smoker for 7 years now and i have nothing but great things to say about it one recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer \( about 7 \) for accurate monitoring of the smoking you 'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels it also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat after 7 years the heating element broke and new ones are 40 through char broil i'm appalled that they 're so much and am contemplating buying another smoker instead	21
1	this is an awesome grill for tailgating it 's easy to pack up and cooks great	21

1	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting grilling with much less heat loss the extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product this steak is b tching was a quote from the gameday crowd at jack kent cook stadium at fedex field in maryland i will continue to pimp my grill with more accessories for next season	21
1	we love these chairs ! we have been looking and did n't want to spend 1000 dollars just for one chair we ended up buying 4 chairs and the sofa the look great around our pool and all our friends rave about them we had seen some chairs from frontgate and these were just as good but at a fraction of the cost	21
1	fast and good product	21
1	i 've only used my rack for cooking chickens but i'm looking forward to doing a turkey soon i 've never sprayed the rack with non stick cooking spray there 's no need to everything comes off and it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher i like the fact that i can put the chicken on the rack way before i put it on the grill the rack makes it easy to get the chicken back into the house too i typically put the rack and cooked chicken on a cookie sheet and carve the chicken right on the rack well made tons of uses yet inexpensive does it get any better	21
1	just received one for a housewarming gift have used it twice and am sure it 's a sleeping giant what a great bbq ! ! ! a little messier than a gas grill and takes maybe 20 mins for coals to be white hot start to finish but what gas grill will get the temperature up to 700 deg ! \? \? talk about the ultimate in broiling ! super easy to light push button ignites w propane in 3 5 mins then wait 15 20 mins and go everyone 's going to want one of these ! !	21
1	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock	21
1	this sofa is a complete bargain it 's stylish in design and comfortable the cushion is firm and supportive the colour and texture of the all weather wicker is fantastic it 's strong standing up to our kids yet light and easy to move around it arrived very promptly and i'm delighted	21
1	i bought two of these sets along with the table and wow i get so many compliments they are beautiful on my new front porch i was skeptic at first because of the price but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more	21
1	i'm so excited to use this table the weather has been rainy ever since i got it it assembled beautifully comes w it 's own little tool it 's a nice strong sturdy table but it 's not overly heavy i was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w o any help it 's going to get a lot of use this summer	21
1	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	21
1	the flowtron bug zapper is a great product but bulbs do wear out the cost of the bulbs are not cheap but the destruction of bugs by this unit is very good i use this unit 9 months of the year	21
1	this is truly a high pressure very hot burner the amount of heat that this is capable of producing is nothing short of amazing if you want to heat or boil a large quantity of water or frying oil it is too hot for small pots this burner will do the job	21
1	grill burner replacement was easy to install the directions where usefu	21
0	how do you expect someone to purchase this item if they do n't know its dimensions please get with the program ! !	21
1	very happy with it my husband and i use herbs from it frequently it produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use	21
0	i received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner i grabbed the arm rest and tried to slide back into the recliner the mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger i could not get out of this trap had my wife not been there to help i would have lost my finger no way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public !	21
0	while the mitt is beautiful and the price is right it is narrow most mitts flare towards the opening this one does not i have larger forearms and it wo n't fit all the way up my husband has average sized arms and it wo n't go around his upper forearm either since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	21
1	its excellent but with black paintings it doesnt reflect too much i recommend i	21
0	a handle was missing the box was retaped may be a return from a store etc overall the item is chintzy you have to assemble it the charcoal pan is painted black this will burn off slowly i am going to assemble it but this item when shipping is included is a total ripoff john	21
0	the name on this item should be pillow it is much too small for a cushion they need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head i wish i had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before i ordered it lesson learned	21
0	the projection was too small and not bright enough the clock was a pain in the neck to set i have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment i returned it	21
0	misunderstood directions made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time cracked all sides trying to take apart called 800 and asked what they could do for me and they said buy another one they 're not responsible also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent suncast will never get my business again and i hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company	21
1	love the projection clock but the alarm is not very loud its also very easy to change the settings without realizing it	21
1	using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill 1 \) an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank 2 \) the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank it does n't look like it is included as offered the quick connect adapter by itself wo n't do you any good	21
0	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
1	just got it yesterday it took a few hours for the clock to adjust to correct time it is accurate and quiet it 's a beauty too this is the 4th la crosse atomic clock in my house \( first analog one \) recommanded	21
1	i'm happy with my grill putting it together was n't that hard it took me under an hour also but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container the grilling was great flames were consistent cleaning is a pain though but i think thats a pain for all grills	21
1	we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too the original one was bought w the 22 wok which is gorgeous we use both w woks and it 's kewl easy to break down for travel too only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available ca n't seem to get one now	21
1	i keep seeing this companies outdoor furniture am tempted to buy but wish someone who 's purchased some would post on how it weathers my porch is uncovered so weathering could be a problem thanks	21
1	sorry to see the other poor reviews of this product because we think this is the best thing since sliced bread ! we bought four of these pest repellers and found that they kill all the flies and spiders in the house we have lots of plants that are breeding grounds for fruit flies this product disrupts their teeny little lives and no sooner are some hatched than they disappear we have to vacuum up the dead house flies and spiders periodically and we have black decker to thank ! i'm buying more for the rest of the house and garage and for gifts	21
1	keeps the ribs from searing lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	21
1	the off color did n't bother me i expected that after reading all the reviews i agree it could have been about 6 lower to the ground however there was a 3 flaw in the stitching of one seam a bead of duco cement sealed that up and it will never be seen on the back side of the grill the heavy duty material looks like it stand the test of time and weather	21
0	after buying two automatic retractable hozelock 50 foot hoses \( that we love \) i bought this for the extra hose length it is a very disappointing unit it tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up i am a big guy and still struggle with it pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle i cut off the end and put on a std us hose fitting	21
1	i have owned one for the past 4 years \( have n't turned it off since the day i bought it \) and it 's still projecting strong as ever i bought one for my friend for christmas also and he loves it just as much as i do	21
0	i would not call this a chair cushion it is much too small more like a minature pillow for children	21
1	i 've been looking for something like this for a long time this product has plenty of room in it for the tree that i have unfortunately it has no structure to it so it 's very flimsy and makes transporting the tree somewhat difficult the fact that you 've made something that replaces the original product packaging is very helpful though i 'll give you an a for the concept and a b for the product design	21
1	the best money i 've spent in a long while got a great bargain at amazon com ! food turns out delicous and it is easy to keep clean charcoal grillers unite ! this is an excellent grill for a small family	21
1	great value sure case could be metal instead of polymer but for the price the capabilities of the watch ca n't be beat very intuitive interface and easy to use compares favorably to watches costing 3 4 times as much	21
0	this product to my knowledge is completely untested i suspect it because it says it requires no boiling which sugestes that it may contain a preservative yeast and or bacterial inhibitor this could not possibly be good for the hummers listen to the experts such as sheri wlliamson \( peterson 's hummingbirds of north america \) sugar and water is just fine filtered water best but not distilled	21
0	i ordered two of these sets and was not sent what is described there is no large aluminum basket and no fish fry basket included the description says it is professional grade but i received commercial grade customer service has offered to send me out a replacement but i am assuming the same thing will happen again it seems as if amazon attached the wrong picture and description to this item beware if you want everything that is listed that's not what you will get	21
1	clock was a great value and looks good on the wall just keeps ticking always on time thumps up to river city clock	21
1	it was more than i expected it was easy to hang looks good and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised too bad i do n't have more places to hang more hammocks	21
0	after opening the weather station and setting it up i noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing characters i contacted amazon and returned it within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem when i contacted them again they would not replace it again saying that the batch they have must be defective i was not aware that amazon was selling the seconds from other retailers a phone call to lacrosse remedied the situation they advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises they further advised the fail ratio with the problem i had with both units is less than 1 beware if buying this from amazon	21
0	do yourself a favor and buy a real heavy duty bbq mitt this one looks nice and fits well but it starting burning one night and i threw it out	21
1	just got to use the weber baby q griddle it worked great the only complaint i have is that it could be bigger it covers just a little over half of the available grill area more would be better other than that the design is excellent and it works great	21
1	i bought two different atomic clock weather from this company both with outside monitors it works just as it is supposed to one puts the time on the ceiling and the other does n't they both read both the outside monitors like a charm some of the buttons are a bit confusing in the dark once i set the alarm by mistake and at 2am i just had to put the thing in another room i could not find the off button	21
0	we need a little more information the chair looks great ! but what kind of material is it constructed from \? how big is it \? a side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves the price is good now if i just knew a little more	21
1	this is a nice rotisserie it could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks \( and shrinks in the process \) you will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets	21
1	i ordered this clock for my dad and he loves it it is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically the indoor temp is a nice addition and the price is right	21
1	in this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate so far this product has worked great its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine i had an indoor outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio garage and the kid 's bedrooms	21
0	we took a chance on these for part of a father 's day gift and the piece of metal that acts as a spring broke after only 1 use after reading the reviews i called the company instead of returning for a refund they were very nice and sent out another one this one just broke exactly like the other one after about a month of use the overall design of the tongs is great like other raichlen products but the construction is severely lacking do n't waste your money on this model	21
1	i have n't tried this item yet as the weather has n't cooperated but the service was great i ordered it as a last minute christmas item and got it in time to make my recepient happy thank	21
0	had for not even a month and when used it broke would not recommend	21
1	wood chips and this rotisserie you are missing one of the great pleasures in life well made and built to last years	21
0	much better versions out there and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one then conserve for a disposable mode	21
1	the la crosse weather station has excellent looks and works well however the outside temperate regulary drops out especially in cold weather overall i'm happy with the form and satisfied with the function	21
1	i purchased this last year and i love this grill i always check consumer reports and they rated this very highly i agree cooking is a cinch on this grill wide grill and cooks evenly ! the only way this grill will catch fire is if you do not clean the grease after each cooking session fortunately lowe 's was putting a whole bunch of of these grills together when i was looking for one so i bought one fully assembled way cool	21
1	the fabric is very strong and nicer looking than the usual black covers very attractive on the deck	21
1	i love it looks good performes perfectly only thing i would like it better if it displayed the outdoor relative humidity numbers are large enough to see from a long distance i would buy it again	21
1	item arrived very soon after ordering using the free shipping option product is of very good quality manufactured by weber not a look alike manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of	21
1	this is a good brush i think it is a bit overpriced though i would have rather saved the money and got another brush it 's good but not worth this much	21
1	a great portable shelter for sun and rain we bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained the weather turned out to be great and sunny so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun it was easy to set up and bring down and the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily	21
1	for the money 10 99 i wish i had bought another set now that i see the price has risen these are heavy and they stay in the ground where put i have had no problem whatsoever with them coming up due to pressure from the hose my hose is very long ultra heavy and thick and the guides keep the hose from going into my plants at the corners they are also very good looking and are a complement to the yard now that the price lowered to 9 99 i bought three more in december 2006 the new ones have the same quality as the earlier one	21
1	our storage shed is perfect ! we are very pleased with the quality size of this unit ! our shed was delivered via eagle usa and i must say this company is awesome a we had never dealt with this company before they called me ahead to set up a delivery time the truck arrived exactly on time \( earlier actually \) the driver was extremely polite very helpful very neat tidy ! ! ! the paperwork was precise legible ! hopefully we will get to use eagle usa in the future ! ! thank you ! sincerely deborah slessinger	21
1	this pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels the squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes i would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound i ca n't hear this noise in the attic so i will buy another when this wears out	21
1	we already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well that we have now added a third sensor in addition we have bought the base unit as gifts and have now bought additional sensors for those that we bought the base unit for we like to be able to check the temperature in our motorhome especially during the winter as well as the garage attic etc my husband moves the sensors to other locations from time to time and has been very impressed with the whole system	21
1	i set the buner in the backyard fire it up the jet engine equivalence heats up extremely quick and i finished sauteeding meat vegie in no time and they taste great full of favor all i need to do now is building a outdoor kitchen so i do n't have to keep moving all the ingredients in and out of the house	21
0	i'm very unhappy with these lights i placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun but they did n't work at all we set them out in the middle of the patio and now five of them do work for a little while but they do n't accomplish their purpose in that area they 're also in the way one of them has never worked at all i gave them the old college try for a month or so but now it 's too late to return them so i'm stuck with them and out my money	21
1	i purchased two of the 9 foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail oriented i 'll probably get one more before the end of summer	21
0	the spring on these tongs broke on first use in september 2006 this renders them largely useless i purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired despite this assurance i am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective i returned them and i cannot recommend these tongs	21
1	put a few racks or ribs and a full chicken in the smoker on the first use and everything came out great with the lp gas it was easy to maintain a pretty steady temperature and the large chip box made great smoke for a long period great barbecue with very little effort	21
1	cover fit easily over grill no problems plus it was cheaper than name brand	21
1	i am extremely happy with this perfect accent lights for my front planter i will definitely buy another set for the side planter price was right but shipping costs a little too high well packaged on delivery	21
1	i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews it did the job i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual	21
1	this is an excellent little grill for home or the road the lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece smokey joe is an apt name the carry handle is awesome the side vents direct air such that i almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor i 've had mine for over a decade and while i 've gone through another big weber kettle and now a huge smoker this little number is still in the race and i have no intentions of giving it up i'm taking it camping with me next weekend it 's a no brainer buy it and be happy	21
1	i have had this for 1 month now and i love it it does record the outdoor and indoor temp you can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock we had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night \( also great ! \) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time it is updated every 24 hours i love it	21
1	i am very pleased with the hose hanger big and sturdy plus it does not look cheap my only problem is that one of the leaves broke off already but for the price it 's a really good buy	21
1	this grill works great everytime ! the only problem i have is with the lighter but it is not a big deal easy to use and always give a great grilling experiences	21
1	the ring and motor do what they are supposed to do the ring did not fit very well at first it was able to rock back and forth however after a little bending into shape it fit more snug the way the ring rests on the kettle there will alway be some gap which does not allow for a good seal i not only use this as a rotisserie but also to give me more room for beer can chicken its worth getting it for the added flexibility	21
1	i have 2 indoor stations in different rooms in my house operating from just 1 outdoor sensor about 60 feet from my house and they work very well and the tempt they show is always the same as my mercury thermometer which is always right on robert johnson lewistown p	21
1	this is a great portable grill for the size the 14 one would be fine for 1 2 people but not more this grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones the hardest part is finding one ! i finally found one on ebay but you better hurry !	21
1	i love this clock it does n't take up too much space on the nightstand and it is religiously accurate	21
1	stainless steel bars will last longer than plain enamel metal bars which lasted a ling time in all kinds of weather since we leave our weber grill outside all year cookung results seem to be the same	21
1	i purchased this for indoor use so it has worked great for what i wanted it to do everything works flawlessly plus it 's a big enough size that you can see it easily across the room	21
1	my family and i love beer can chicken but i did n't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can this weber poultry roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can the chicken remains stable too no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can and it 's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine what a fabulous product	21
1	i love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price the battery lasts forever so it 's portable the time sets itself atomically it shows the temperature has the obligatory annoying alarm clock the time lights up on the ceiling and it looks good to boot very well made and highly recommended oregon scientific rocks	21
0	mine showed up broken it seems that a single string on a pulley is what is used to raise and lower the umbrella via the crank the string in mine was broken off \( not connected \) and inside the main pole not a great design for lasting a long time in any kind of weather i 'll try another brand	21
1	this is the most awesome wonderful fantastic grill there is out there everyone knows charcol ca n't be beat for flavor but it 's a bummer to get started weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill it is super easy to start the coals easy to keep clean and looking fabulous easy to empty the ashes and easy move around the deck \( out of our frequent seattle rain \) and of course the food we grill comes out delectable i am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method a snap with this grill ! it is well worth the price we love it ! !	21
1	it 's not the best grill in the world but for the price it does the job well enough it cooks unevenly the front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center	21
1	this is our second weber grill in the past 10 years in fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s same size and features we actually use natural gas rather than propane \( i goofed on the order \) but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one we 've used it a few times and it works perfectly quickly heats up and grills evenly looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill	21
1	an excellent product fits my grill perfectly easy to put on and take off looks like a winner ! one small sewing flaw but otherwise well mad	21
1	this chair is stylish and comfortable it 's hard to tell what the wicker is made of which does not look like plastic \( even though i suspect it is \) the wicker is smooth and looks high quality the cushion is firm and deep we 've had it a while now and it 's stood up to rough treatment from our kids delivery was unexpectedly quick within ten days	21
1	my husband was very pleased with this set it is the best one yet the handles are great to grip and the set is easy to use they wash clean easily this is a great product i would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill	21
1	i cannot wait to have a party i purchased both this and the fire pit table both pieces are easy to assemble sturdy and really fun ! my sister is going to be so jealous what are sisters for	21
1	this is truely a must have the flat non stick skewers holds everything in place they wo n't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for 7 39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for 5 99 a set i ordered 5 sets ! ! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food get yours today do n't wait get at least 2 sets	21
1	i got one of these loungers as a gift this past christmas as soon as i put it on the deck everyone wanted to use this chair so i got online and found another so we can share it is more comfortable than any chair in our house	21
1	i purchased this item for the offic gift exchange the golfers went crazy for it we have the kind of exchange where you can steal someone else 's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds ! nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture	21
1	this is a fantastic grill i highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening	21
1	i received one with my la crosse weather station and placed it on the east side of my dwelling it provides a true reading unlike others i 've used in the past i plan on adding 1 or 2 more sensors for an even better reading	21
0	this product is a waste of money the mice in my room are completely unaffected and walk right by the device without any sign of concern besides being ineffective the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound \( not silent as advertised \) i now have to buy a set of \( humane \) mousetraps and i recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves 40	21
1	nice cushions that dry out pretty fast seem durable they also seem high quality the only thing is they are more of a tan color the picture shows them as white which is what i really wanted but they are nice could use a strap at the top also so the wind does n't constantly blow them over	21
1	we have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area	21
1	my husband loved the size quality and heavy weight of this product great for the male chef in the family	21
1	i have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years the igniter was actually still quite good it is very well made as are most weber products the stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting \( yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat \) it is easy to replace and i end up giving the entire grill a cleaning and tuneup	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
1	the person that i gave this gift to really enjoys and finds it easy to use	21
1	bought this as an open box what a great detector for the money i had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins very easy setup ! ! took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins \( one was a wheat penny \) the lcd correctly displayed them as a pennies as this was my first time detecting the unit seems very easy to use an excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price	21
1	fast delievery great price and quality we will enjoy it many years to come	21
1	we absolutely love it it is truly amazing we only wish we had this clock a long time ago we have missed out on a lot of fun and convenience we have enjoyed this instrument so much that we ordered six more for each one of our children they have all reported back on how much they love theirs as well	21
0	i bought this thing to solve a problem and i have a new one i red the little manual trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way it does not stay in projection mode if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button i change the battery i left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters and no way i wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection of course i do not recogmend it	21
1	exactly what i was looking for very heavy duty and the fit was perfect	21
0	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
1	bought this as a gift for my husband he says it 's great for bbqing over oak wood i like the way the light shines thru the cut outs	21
1	this is one fantastic grill it is easy to ignite and heats up faster than death valley in july cleaning is easy with removable parts for maximum effect i suggest some type of grill cleaner to dissolve the carbonized left overs that will make your bbq look like new there 's some assembly required which took us about twice as long as the directions say it should but once you taste your steaks and burgers you will never be sorry you made the purchase	21
1	i 've used this along with the base station for one year now i 've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine	21
1	i use this bbq with mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks and smoked some pork ribs a chicken a london broil and a giant hamburger so far no marinade just a dry rub and on the grill the book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the i in ideal for as much of the cook time as possible which is not hard to do make sure to cure it before you use it this burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing cure it using the propane burner easy to assemble too	21
1	i agree completely with the other reviewer well packaged easy to put together very sturdy way better quality than those you see at outdoor concept stores i mainly ordered it b c i knew it would be the right size to go w the strathwood chaise lounges i ordered i am very happy with it	21
1	this outdoor bird cage is ideal in the winter because it has a strong wire mesh that prohibits piles of snow or manure to fall into the living area of the bird works well with mostly smaller birds plenty of room for seeds and water even a furry friend or two can also substitute for a squirrel cage or a mini buddhist temple for midgets	21
1	the umbrella was quite a score through amazon including the shipping handling it was still cheaper than walmart ! lol additionally it is of great quality we utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green it is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with tropical storm tammy ! twice	21
1	i bought this grill locally after researching many others i originally did not want a side burner but have been very happy with it it works great for cooking vegetables in a pan and is superb with the griddle for cooking breakfast i can cook an entire dinner or breakfast without using the stove i do agree that it did take a long time to assemble \( about 2 hrs \) but is solid and works beautifully i would highly recommend this grill for the money it is a great deal	21
1	these are very nice quality and comfortable everything was as expected and came in just a few days	21
1	no longer is my wall clock wrong because of power shortages or because i failed to set it or reset it correctly	21
0	this unit will be lucky to be within 15 deg of actual out side temp after several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different sending unit which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit i would not recommend this unit to anyone	21
0	one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector 's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a 10 tie for his birthday	21
1	plain and simple very effective i plugged this device in to the wall in my office in a school within seconds the roaches in our kitchen area ran into the hallway they have not been seen since there have not been any mouse droppings around either	21
0	i purchased this for my husband and it quit working after 3 months	21
1	if you are looking for this to be very accurate then you need to use the lithium batteries because of the cold temps here the cheaper batteries do not work as well maybe where it does n't get in the minus temps the rayovac batteries will be okay but not here in ne the sensor needs to be put in a location that is out of the sun and out of reach of your pets and children which makes for a little decision making time on your part	21
1	we bought our performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store it was the best purchase we ever made ! its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition about 15 20 minutes you 're ready to grill for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal its a piece of cake \( we had our reservations too ! \) and you 're going to wish you switched sooner food never tasted so good	21
1	the bench is easy to assemble and lid actuallydoes work well it is not an item that will lastforever but it is priced fairly for what it is a storagebench	21
0	i bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly i do n't like it when small pieces of food fall through especially on gas grills so i bought this well on first use it stained so bad despite my priming it and worse it warped hey i can still use it but it 's kinda like wearing soiled clothes wo n't feel as good	21
1	when the time zone change happened earlier this year the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock the outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings however i would never ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it 's cloudy or sunny it 's often wrong i also like the light projected readings of the clock it 's too bad that you ca n't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which i prefer sometimes over the projection	21
1	these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella very low tech and smart my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for they are totally stationary and do n't have a tilting feature that might be standard i just do n't know but i would have wanted that flexibility oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible and they 're simple to put together and take apart great price and they block the sun and look terrific	21
