0	i seriously hope that the price tag i am seeing is \( 7 000 \) is a mistake	6
0	impossible to rate product as amazon shipped brake cleaner instead of polish return of inexpensive items not worth the time it takes consider not using amazon for small purchases until return system is upgraded	6
0	ok it 's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate i thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it \( and even then the edges are blurry \) check the laws in your local state i'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal ! ! ! i had to trash mine thanks for taking my money	6
0	i installed this cover and took pictures from various distance and angel i could read all numbers clearly they claim that it will work with actual traffic camera i have no way to test that	6
0	this is bad very bad it slips so easy that you cannot get a firm grip on the filter i would suggest anyone to look elsewhere and get something else that actually works i really regret getting this	6
0	listen if you truly want an ionizer that dramaticaly changes the air i strongly advise people to purchase one by flair this home unit retails for 300 need results that 's what a real one costs	6
0	i drove for an hour with the cooler plugged in and it did not get any cooler inside it might keep frozen things from fully thawing but a regular plastic cooler would do it too not worth the money	6
0	they broke the first time that i used them the locking mechanism is cheap and slides out of its intended slot do n't waste your money on this item	6
0	i cannot believe they put this on the market once it gets wet there is n't much you can do about wringing it out it 's title is true it is a water magnet the problem is it just wo n't let the water go this towel is horrible i suggest using the 3 pack microfiber meguiar 's towels sold by amazon as well under the subject meguiar 's x2020 supreme shine microfiber pack of 3	6
0	advertised as easy to install just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it wrong if your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle they also do n't tell you it is not compatible with motorcycle relays if you get past all of this it does have a great sound	6
0	my car was stolen with device engaged it was stolen while my wife and i were both at home we did not hear a single thing their 'guarantee' by the way is a complete farse wow they 'll cover the deductable but only on a comprehensive coverage policy if you are wanting to keep your car safe do not buy this product ! !	6
0	i own both the original unbreakable autolock \( with the flat key \) and the autolock pro \( with the round key \) the original autolock never failed to open after 10 years of use on two cars the autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use this is not a key problem because i could not open it with two original keys i eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it i recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device	6
0	this product was purchased as a christmas gift for my father unfortunately it did not perform for him i was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model i am not sure if we just got a defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i have to say returning to amazon was straightforward they just simply refunded my money i will inturn buy my dad something else from amazon you just cant beat the service	6
0	fatally flawed magnificently compact clever design but broke first time i used it el cheapo plastic clamps snapped service center would n't repair it so i had to return it an otherwise beautiful design with a frustrating achilles heel aarrgh !	6
0	i just received the gauge and i'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes the hose did n't seal well on the tire valve when bleeding air the display did n't update you have to remove the hose wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading this is ridiculous the display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel	6
0	if this gauge cost 20 i would give it a high rating but even at the discounted 35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value let alone the nearly 50 it cost me ! as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool not just cold temps general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway i would not buy again	6
0	as other reviewers mentioned the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings it may be accurate but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several minute guessing and waiting game calling it a racing gauge is ridiculous	6
0	dimensions are confusing inaccurate stated height of 11 5 inches is not correct perhaps this is shipping container actual product is about 8 5 inches high but taking into account the cradle for tire only raises the vehicle about 6 inches	6
0	i'm writing this reveiw on the company discount ramps rather than the ramps themselves they charged my credit card immediately upon ordering then 6 weeks later when i inquired about where these ramps were they told me the manufacturer had n't received the metal to build them yet and the build time is 4 6 weeks just be careful people	6
0	i bought this item and i literally hate it they make it seem so simple and easy but the blade does not do a good job in removing water from car surfaces i would only recommend it for doing windows much easier to use chamois or regular old terrycloth towels	6
0	i got this item for my coffee loving truck driver husband when we took it out of the box we saw the obvious problem the mug is tiny ! only a bit larger than an espresso cup to add insult to injury it took way too long to brew for such a small cup now it 's back in the box collecting dust and we 're sorry we wasted our hard earned money	6
0	this bag was junk on a 2001 4runner the poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload i realize it is n't made for all vehicles but i purchased mine only after speaking with lund who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware great service from amazon terrible service from lund	6
0	i had a previous non brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died i bought this one thinking it would be better the first time i used it i could n't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings it also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading it would disappear before i could read it fully	6
0	i have had 2 faulty units right out of the box the first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times i returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge even after being on charge for several days i am moving on to another brand do n't waste your time and money on these poor quality items	6
0	bought one of these to jump start my 3 6 litre 911 it doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged complete waste of time maybe it will start a lawn mower	6
0	i would n't recommend this product the positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it i as i was stranded rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w the remaining half of the clamp then the charger \( which was charged fully the previous night \) did n't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over i will be returning to the store tonight returning this item and purchasing a different charger	6
0	i have not used this product our local news did a test on it they found that in 2 vehicles \( exactly the same \) that this device only lowered the temp 1 degree again i have not used it i am just throwing the test i saw out there their call sign is wcpo so look it up from there \( not allowed to include link \)	6
0	it 's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it then you can never use that window for anything else it 's a pain because it will not work on tinted windows run	6
0	the product is not working the provider is terrible ! ! you can not reach them via email nor return the product it is the worst experience in amazon ! ! i wish i knew this provider and read these reviews before i bought it ! ! !	6
0	does not work \( cool the interior of the vehicle \) barely at all compared to the ads so false advertising i purchased 2 and one also broke right away very cheaply made product also would never purchase again nor recommend to anyone	6
0	i purchaced this product because its a great idea the problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway	6
0	absolutely useless do not buy this product you are wasting your money learn from me i wasted on two ! they are tiny tiny fans that move hardly any air at all also they do not work on tinted windows trust me save yourself some money and just crack your windows it works 100 better	6
0	it worked for me ! my car is now a blistering 120 degrees as opposed to the scorching 121 degrees a month ago the only thing i ever got out of this product was screwed i 've been bamboozled ! ! do n't believe the hype stand up against the man ! chumps unite ! god ! what a piece of poo	6
0	i also purchased this product was extremely disappointed when i found out it did not work like the 1st reviewer wrote it basically is a mini fan that moves but it does not cool the car down at all ! there was absolutely no difference in the temperature of my car after i installed it ! don't waste your money	6
0	to turn off your check engine light on most vehicles with your vehicle turned off pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle in most cases the light will shut off if there is truly a problem with you car the light will either not stay off or come right back on you do not need this device to do that the second problem is if your car does need attention this device wo n't really properly diagnose or certainly wo n't fix it and you 'll still have to go to a mechanic so i'm left wondering what good this is	6
0	it is ok for small dogs large dogs will knock it down	6
0	maybe it depends on the car but i could n't get it tight enough in my suv to prevent the dogs from knocking it down it also probably depends on the dog if the dog really wants to get past it they will if you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a psychological barrier this would be ok oh and as a previous reviewer mentioned the trombone style sides slide easily back and forth i had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place	6
0	loved the price but i never actually received the item it shipped to the wrong address and i never got it back	6
0	the product came defective so i had to throw it away i emailed the company three times and nobody ever answered back	6
0	this is the worst smelling freshener i have ever used its just a terrible smell like the other reviewer said its very chemical in nature i sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and wow i opened the windoes pretty quick i could not imagine this in a hot car i picked it up for 1 50 at a biglots and i feel ripped off dont buy it	6
0	the cushion was designed for what i needed due to an injury but the curve of the cushion the pressure points and the density of the cushion are wrong i guess you get what you pay for i have found a similar cushion that works very well	6
0	i bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant unfortunately after about half an hour the memory foam gets totally squished down and it 's almost useless do n't try to save money by getting this cheap one spend the extra money and get one that does n't suck	6
0	i bought the wagan 9788 ortho cushion and it does not meet the deminsions at all the total lenght was to be 19 it 's 16 1 2 etc how can wagan screw up something like that or did they \? making something to short by accident and lying to the people until it 's fixed	6
0	this product came quickly but i should have listened to the other reviewers they said the cushion would squash flat in a week and it has just spend the extra dough and get some thing of a better quality otherwise you will regret it in the long ru	6
0	this cushion is very disappointing in less than a week it has gone completely flat and the seams have separated i am not a large person either ! it does n't even puff back up when i do n't use it do n't buy it it does not do anything it is advertised for	6
0	i had been wanting this for 2 years due to having a cracked tail bone several times in my life when i saw it at this price i bought it right away i'm here to tell you not to waste your money ! i only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when i sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever it was a big disappointment	6
0	i could not get enough vacuum to draw the oil from the crankcase unit would not work i am very dissatisfied with the product	6
0	the pump in theory suppose to suck oil out of the dipstick hole it did not do it for honda engine it did for snowblower you will need to get dirty to change your own oil	6
0	i followed the instructions to the letter but it only worked about 50 of the time i will be sending it bac	6
0	i purchased this for my 2001 vw golf and it did not work i know some of the other vehicles wire directly in but you have to put a spare key in the unit and wrap it around the ignition it made the install seem very half a ed i could have just taped the key to the ignition at that point i will get the immobilizer delete software instead of this junk thumbs down from me on at least vw and audi application	6
0	thought i 'd just confirm what i 've learned too i bought it realized after research it could be picked in seconds with a pen and returned it	6
0	advanced security is all a lie these locks can be easily opened without a key i have written to the masterlock company and they replaced the lock free of charge to a one that uses a regular key	6
0	bike lock manufacturer kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks which this model uses can be very easily picked kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place	6
0	sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct does n't work the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work i was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module it does n't hold it in rotational position	6
0	you are better off with a sponge and a bucket there ai n't a quick fix to washing your car without going to the local car wash	6
0	arrived with dead batteries in it factor the price and time of getting three aaa batteries on your own into your decision of whether to buy this product or not	6
0	i'm very pleased with this laser garage park this laser garage park was easy to install and works really well i would recommend this to any one looking for a practicalway to avoid damage to their car while trying to park in thegarage	6
0	i purchased the set of two park smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door but even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again i may say the service i got through amazon com was first rate it 's the product i found wanting	6
0	the description of this product is not accurate these lights are not bright i have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light it is a pretty color of light but very dim	6
0	we were trying to get rid of the wires for under the cabinet lighting however the led lights were definitely not sufficient for this area we were very disappointed even after trying to double the number recommended in an area	6
0	caution too many equipments through one socket may cause overload and possible fire in yor vehicle there is no proper technical information provided for this product and no mention of a safety fuse either even if you buy this product be careful not to plug in more than 2 things at a time also note that all outlets are very close to each other with a potential to cause damage to your charging adapters	6
0	installed my bulldog 2030 ! it 's is a total piece of junk it only works when you tap on the hood you can pound on the back of the car and nothing put the sensor at max still nothing ! this is more of a novelty not an alarm its a freaking joke ! do n't waste your money	6
0	highly concentrated chemical smell definitely gets rid of odors but does not smell like a new car	6
0	this car seat cushion 's foam padding is not only paper thin but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts \( i'm not kidding \) placed in some of the cushion 's massaging bubbles this makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine ! i threw my massage cushion into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing	6
0	one day when it was 100 degrees outside i used it in my car rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop when i came out and got into my car it was hotter than i could have ever imagined it had n't cooled my car prior to that either it looked like a very small fan blowing and that was it i came home took it off and threw it out i was not satisfied at all	6
0	this includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item who 's actually going to put this on their car \? it makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away check the picture see anything messy you have to stick onto your car \? misleading and a waste of money do n't buy it	6
0	these are more of an accent light than task lights not what i expected should have paid attention to other reviews	6
0	a tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well that is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire my accugage was reading 5 psi high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer that 's why i give it only one star	6
0	easy and clear steps to follow in installation although the universal remote is really bad feels very cheap tachless mode works great but finding service and tech support is almost impossible good luck contacting them	6
0	this item performed as expected reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with obd ii connector easy to use only 2 buttons ! you might be able to find it 10 cheaper at a local store on sale but even at the price i paid it was a bargain ! cost of tool 1 diagnostic visit to local shop	6
0	this obdii reader is way too simple does n't really do much in diagnostic could not reset anything save up and buy a bit more better unit	6
0	the product would not put out enough current to help with the drain on my battery i think i purchaced too small of a unit for my needs may work well with a smaller type of battery not on a car battery	6
0	bought 2 of these both failed at extactly the same time after a few months save your money	6
0	it took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi truck air \? it could barely fill a car tire it would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it stay clear	6
0	we received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it not only does it not fill anything pass 15 psi the 12v cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig lighter the plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out with the few more times we used it i the tip completely broke at least it comes with 7 year warranty save yourself the disapointment and headache	6
0	last time i purchased them they came in a nice sleeve these are awkward and only have a band to wrap around them	6
0	i would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above thanks for alerting me to the misleading information	6
0	i returned the activation card without activating because i was misled by the description of the product i understood that the eautorepair activation would be for a multitude of vehicles from 1983 to present but the card is for only one vehicle per subscription not mentioned in the description	6
0	i think i must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated it never dried to a haze for me the first time i used it i thought i had n't shaken the bottle enough the second time i shook the bottle seven days later it still has n't dried enough to buff off i'm not sure if its the product or whether amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit	6
0	you cant chose the music to play not that loud overall sucks \( just get the airhorns \) if i wasnt too lazy to return this item i would have it sucks	6
0	the seat covers are cute but only 1 comes in a box and while i was putting them in my car one of them ripped ! obviously the quality is not very good	6
0	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	6
0	the oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case and the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil maybe you 'll find this product wonderful and a cost effective alternative what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine \? a small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil	6
0	gimmick there are a number of rerouting oil change kits available why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail \? the oil filter seals itself very well on most engines while it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles i would n't risk hose failure for a little convenience on my toyota truck i discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter i'm not sure that many people even change their own oil it 's cheaper to take it to the toyota dealer 29 95 and they even rotate the tires	6
0	sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits ca n't siphon all that out most quickie lube stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine the right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom that does a much better job of removing the sludge	6
0	i purchased two of these both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual not that you really need one the outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes i guess it depends who defines a few minutes both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water to make a pot that would be 100 minutes i am returning as i am definitely disappointed	6
0	it was not as advertised it did not come with the lighter power cord i am returning it because that is why i bought it i need a back lit display so that i can see it at night this will not stay on because it is battery powered only	6
0	this piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it 's dead and it 's really easy to charge and use problem is after i had used it a couple times the cheapo plastic clamps both snapped now they ca n't grip on the battery terminals under warranty but so expensive to ship \( shipping not covered by warranty \) that it is n't worth it great idea shoddy construction all vector have these same plastic clamps so try to find one with metal clamps	6
0	this is the second accu gauge tire pressure gauge i have purchased the first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years this one when compared to three other digital gauges always shows about 3 4 lbs less pressure	6
0	this product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows tv convinces you there 's a real chance you might find yourself underwater in your car and now whoever manufactures this makes a killing i 'll put it in a drawer with my sars facemask my whole life insurance policy and that replacement plan best buy just tried to sell me on a twenty dollar pair of headphones i'm sure this thing works as advertised and i'm just as sure you 'll never need to find out	6
0	after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed in plain view of the sun the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again after the effort i put in carefully mounting the unit i'm very disappointed and do n't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work	6
0	i was looking for something like this for months it was a new product on amazon when i did a froogle search installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when i turned on the light i was disappointed my 8x10 shed was dimly lit lots of shadows certainly not enough to work by not much more light than what my lawn lights put out during the past two months i 've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time after being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died i have n't even begun to look for a new one very disappointe	6
0	when the factory charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light this was a fluorescent version the replacement unit quickly sent by amazon was led the same case and everything but with bright leds inside i liked it much better than the fluorescent one the second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted then the leds would start blinking like an emergency light sunforce said that this was not normal behavior i returned it as well the light will stay up for around two hours charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use a nice product but quallity needs to be improved	6
0	well i bought two of these i put it in my car in less then a week both of them ripped in the middle area i expected it to last a little longer \? \? i guess ill try sewing it back together or somethin	6
0	i received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam \( also shortly after they were installed \) i came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem i know not to waste my money they are very unique and i do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality	6
0	if i can see what i'm buying \? please add a picture	6
0	this is a single extension the product description is completely misleading	6
0	very dissapointing the inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims	6
0	the tie down straps are for my harley you get 2 5 inch rubber cords and 4 flexible 1 ft cords and 25 plastic 5 inch hose clamps what do you use them for i can get 1000 of them for 5 bucks at bargain corner im sendin my package back not worth the money you might use the plastic case for fishin thats allr lako pittsburgh pa	6
0	we were expecting more of a cushion feel to this seat but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving it would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe but for a cushion its flat and cheap feeling as for king size it barely covers our car 's seat we ended up returning them not worth it	6
0	i 'd give this a zero if allowed easily leaks from both twist caps any money i saved by changing my oil was spent on degreaser and paper towels cleaning my garage floor	6
0	this product works great for draining your car 's crankcase oil it has a screen to catch the drain plug however the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a piece of crap you are supposed to tighten it down then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal the large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half inch too far makes no seal at all it falls off when you tip the unit to drain emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor this is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well	6
0	whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire do not buy unless you enjoy wasting your money	6
0	this product is absolutely worthless especially in the hot texas summer the pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit it is still blazing hot when you get inside do n't waste your money on this over hyped piece of garbage better to leave your windows down or park under a tree	6
0	this product is not worth the money it does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money beware of products that only make money for the inventor	6
0	too hard to follow the instructions i bought it for my mom who said she could not tell the difference i am not sure she followed the instructions i am just assuming \( she is an english professor \) it didnt work too well	6
0	must be in the window with direct sun cheaply made very low air pull best advertising campaign since salad shooter and chia pet it will not perform to the expectations that the tv ad promises glad that i did not buy more than one of them	6
0	very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but no go to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress no go	6
0	this product works well if you want to strip paint do not use this product if you have any paint on your wheels that you want to keep ther	6
0	it was cheap so i figured what they hey bad idea it only worked when it wanted to showed the wrong direction most of the time and being cheaply made fell apart	6
0	i thank goodness did not buy this product but was very tempted i want to thank all the honest people for their reviews it saved me money and time thank you	6
0	whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire do not buy unless you enjoy wasting your money	6
0	this product does work but it has to face the sun so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning not in the afternoon it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the tv ad also they are hard to place with powered windows	6
0	this device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising but does absolutely nothing it says it does the unit is hard to install for beginners it is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather if there is low sunlight or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows even factory shading it does not work you must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun \? \?	6
0	this product does not cool down the car it is too small i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks if you buy this please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe	6
0	if you have tinted windows this product does not work	6
0	it does not work and when it arrive i found it broken ! ! made from cheap materials and i can rate it with a half sta	6
0	it does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it i would n't suggest this product	6
0	this thing does not install in seconds as suggested it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you 're supposed to put in the window with it who want 's to fool with that everytime \? it also says to not use with tinted windows something that could have been mentioned here	6
0	installation of these blades is not straightforward three adapter pieces and a pin are included which might work well enough but the instructions provided with the product could not be more of a joke i 'll be returning to the store and asking one of their employees \( at kragen \) to install all three blades \( they 're nice enough there if you 're willing to wait \) in the future i wo n't be buying this product when i need new blades i do n't mind a bit of complication in installing stuff like this but the instructions should be adequate to the task and they 're really not	6
1	i bought one today for my mazda tribute because i did n't like the built in cup holders it 's actually very sturdy and fits very well	6
1	i bought one today for my mazda tribute because i did n't like the built in cup holders it 's actually very sturdy and fits very well	6
1	has everything and more inside great price concidering how much you get literally has like 100 of stuff in it	6
1	very thorough kit seems to be a very good value for everything included my husband really liked it	6
1	has the power to get you back on the road when the battery fails i am sure it does more but at this time that is all that has been asked	6
1	the reasons that i bought this charger is because it has a docking stations which can be used to charge and store the unit when not in use after the charging is completed the docking station will enter a floating charge mode to prevent overcharging some other charger need to be monitored carefully since overcharging can damage the battery with this unit i can just leave it and forget it also this unit is small enough that my wife can use it to jumpstart her minivan some other multifunction charger are so heavy you 'd have to be a weightlifter to carry the thing	6
1	i use this as an alternate 12v power source to power a 12vair compressor and it is a great product ! it can power aspot light \( 15 watts 12v \) for 12 hours so it does n't have a problem at all when i blow up tires floats etc	6
1	worth the price as my window is always clean just for a comparison i leave a new but lesser quality wiper on the passenger side the difference is incredible	6
1	these are great blades installation is very straight forward the only gripe i have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1 2 but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke but it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars i guess there are no replacement for factory blades	6
1	you do not need to remove the adhesived back despite the commentary by another reviewer the instructions explain how you can just take off the top portion to replace the batteries it is not a blindingly effective light but it does work the dot its were recommend to us by folks on the scion xb boards the light in the interior is n't suffcient the dot its work very well and fit nicely throughout dark spots the adhesive is very strong	6
1	very nice product holds lots of things especially able to put full size pieces of paper in a zippered compartment which is very useful for me	6
1	the product really charges my two batteries and let me when they are getting low glad i brought the charger	6
1	i am not trying for a show quality shine just a nice clean car and drying with spots was always the issue for me outside the 6 wash i liked this i washed and watched dry two cars and a motorcycle in just the time it took to wet wipe with soap and rinse with the no spot setting worked great for the price	6
1	i use this system on the outside of the windows of our home and love it i picked up a long handled sheepskin window washing tool and love the whole system must do the windows when the sun is not on them it has worked great now for two years inside of windows shine if you use a window cleaner and newspapers i thought the newspapers would not absorb the cleaner but they work great hope you find this as useful as i have bluekitt	6
1	i think the people who give one stars are n't following the directions wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly \( even in texas \) i do n't think it really matters how you wash it using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product also the filter does n't as long as i would like this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle	6
1	simplifies car washing as soap and water are contained in the easy to use sprayer the best thing is the finish eliminates the need for drying with chamois etc and leaves a streak free spotless finish especially on windows i'm happy with it	6
1	what is missing is that the product gets free refills from zymol for life so if you use a lot of high end wax then this will pay for itself in a few years and yes zymol makes the best wax i 've ever used	6
1	i hope the person reviewing above is joking because it is not a body hair removal wax it is for automobiles the high percentage of white carnuba which is what it is made with provides an intense luster to the car paint	6
1	the desert gets really dusty so having this product to swipe over my car \( especially windows \) helps me save money on car washes i wish the package had included a bigger cover to store the brush in it 's awkward putting it back into the same cover it came in once you start accumulating dirt	6
1	although i have not tried other models of the california duster i really like this design since this model has dusting tassles all the way around you simple rotate the duster after each wipe this will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot this design also works well for dusting the underside of my car 's spoiler the duster really does capture dust and not just push it around my only complaint is that the re usable storage bag should be larger than it is to make it easier to get the duster back into it	6
1	this is a very good duster i have owned one for 5 years and now i have to replace	6
1	have always used the regular california duster time to replace the one i have had for years thought i would try the extra large duster this has twice the dusting surface it is faster and does the same great job i have a black town and country which shows dust ! this does a great job in just a few minutes a great product	6
1	this duster is heavy duty does a great job and is much bigger that i thought it would be overall i am very happy with this item if you need a car duster this one is a home run	6
1	the super duster has been very efficient in removing dust off my new 2005 camry xle and keeping her shiny between washes along with trimming car wash expenses the full knitting minimizes twists of the wrist inherent with one sided dusters to keep upright i recommend this product most highly paul everett vinsonsan antonio t	6
1	i just bought a new white convertible and this product is the greatest for quickly removing dust and light dirt i am using it daily as it is so easy and quick car is spotless after 3 weeks of heavy driving and i have n't needed to use my free car wash from the dealer	6
1	the powerball products work well if you have wheels and other billet goodies this will become your best buddy	6
1	my husband was very happy to receive this gift he loves the mothers products	6
1	if were a celebrity i would endorse it on tv it sweeps my car hood windows roof trunk lid and headlights beautifully ! the scraper is fierce and lets ice on the window know who s boss ! me that s who with my long reach red handled blizzard model 3512 snowbrush and scraper thanks hoppy !	6
1	what can i say \? mothers makes great stuff for auto care and this is one of them just make sure you read the instructions and do it right also this is not going to raise any death from its grave it the wheel is pretty busted it may just not have hope	6
1	works just as i anticipated great product very simple way to put onto your licence plate and definetly worth the buy it doesnt get no bette	6
1	great product ! my wife gave it to me as a birthday present and i thought what a cheap gift but who would have ever thought this would actually save me a year of tickets	6
1	the reflector cover works great ! it has consistently kept those tickets out of my mailbox its simplicity and ease of use is what made me interested in it in the first place and now i can be sure that it is a 100 effective for all those red light cameras i would seriously advice all of you to get this product it definitely does justice to the unfairness of costly traffic tickets \( most likely not even your fault ! \) excellent product !	6
1	i like to think of my self as a responsible driver but when i get a ticket for going over 10mph i get really ticked off i searched trough the internet trying to find a solution for these ridicules tickets and i found the reflector cover this stuff is amazing i have seen a flash go off while i pass trough speed camera it 's been almost 2 months and i still did n't get any ticket i think everyone should protect themselves with the reflector cover because the cameras are there to collect revenue instead of protecting the public	6
1	i recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on amazon after i put it on my plates i have been through several red light intersections in the evenings on numerous occasions and to date i have yet to receive a fine i believe the reflector cover has already paid for itself	6
1	i kept getting tickets in the mail for going through ez pass tool booth out here in new york city my sticker was valid and i had money in my account they had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail each time i wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets they told the system had problems and they would fix it well i put a stop to it when i ordered 2 reflectors for my cars i have not had any tickets in the mail since i love this product it is so simple and yet effective everyone should get it the best 50 i have spent lately	6
1	i bought a pair of the reflector about a year ago i love them i have n't got a ticket since now i drive with confidences i do n't get stressed out when i go through a yellow light or see a photo radar van on the side of the road they are not going to get me again the first 100 ticket was the last as far as i am concerned trust me do n't wait till you get zapped	6
1	did n't realize how easy and effective it is until now i can clean a room in a couple of minutes definitely worth buying	6
1	the dash of my black car is anthracite gray and it shows dust easily the california duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax this picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior picking it all up in one swipe i keep this in the car and once a week i swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean it 's small enough to keep handy under the seat this makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car or for someone who likes doing their own detailing	6
1	works great ! use it around the house on computer monitors tvs your car 's dash etc	6
1	even if i could have only used this once for the 8 or so dollars it cost it would be worth it for how quickly and easily i was able to rid my apartment of dust sort of like a cheesy carnival game except i ended up with a dust free home just shake it off and it looks a tad grey from remaining dust but continues to pick it up amazingly well i bow before it 's greatness and just hope it lasts although if i need to buy a new one in a few months i 'll do it in an instant	6
1	this duster is fabulous dusting will never be fun but with this tool it almost is ! as a computer teacher i purchased two the students even asked if they could dust with it they did a great job on the computer screens tables and shelves	6
1	i show mustangs and dirt lint dust can really impact a judge this little thing works wonders and it 's bigger brother keeps your car clean and dust free initially it will leave a bit of streaking on dark paint as the waxy substance that grabs dirt can come off a bit but as you use it and it gets dirtier it works better and better the streaks easily come off with a quick spritz of detail spray get this use it you 'll love it and get the large one for your outside trust me it 's that good	6
1	the dash duster leaves the passenger compartment spotless it is better than having strangers at the car wash wipe the interior of your car with the same soiled terry cloth towels used on other vehicles along with wiping their own sweaty faces with ! paul everett vinsonsan antonio t	6
1	many years back i worked retail and the shelves in my store were all black and our district office always sent us these dusters to clean the shelves with so now many years down the road we refurnished our living room w black furniture and the first thing i did was go out and get one of these it is the best thing ever for dusting ! it leaves absolutely no lint behind and works like a charm !	6
1	i purchased it about a year and half ago it still does the job however i recently noticed that the duster does not work as well as in the beginning	6
1	a wonderful kit to have in case of an emergency situation all that it lacks it a cellphone	6
1	this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time	6
1	the meguiars water magnet lives up to its name it dries great and does not scratch make sure to wash the car with a brush before drying to get all the dirt off simple powerwashing will not remove all dirt do not use one of those california water blades sand and dirt particles get swiped across the side and leave tons of tiny scrathes	6
1	installed this on my 2006 civic ex sedan to replace the pathetic \( meep meep ! \) sounding factory horn the factory horn made me shrink in embarassment everytime i used it well no more this bad boy made the receiving end to shrink now lol	6
1	i have had this horn on my triumph bonneville america for about a year it is extremely loud and attracts alot of attention it was easy to install and has proved to be very reliable	6
1	my fiancee loves these they are cute and they keep the car clean and they match the comfy steering wheel cover	6
1	my last 5 cars had leather seats my new town and country has fabric seats my wife insisted i get leather the wagen tech in 2248 looks right fits right feels right i liked it so well i bought another for my side of the t c the right product at the right peicejerell sorensen	6
1	this is a much nicer seat cover than i imagined it would be \( especially for the cost \) the only complaint i have is that with it in place i ca n't extend my head rest \( i'm tall \) but other than that it 's very comfortable and protects the car seat under it very well i wear suspenders and without something to protect the seat the car seat gets cut by the buckles	6
1	i think in this country where i live dominican republic it 's a must to have at least two security features installed in oyur car if you do n't want to bewith your hands over your head when the thieves take your car i choose this product because everybody uses steering wheels clubs and to make it more difficult i purchased this one i do n't know if it works or not because i have n't been robed but i hope it does as promise	6
1	i have degenerative disc disease and am in chronic pain this back support seat cushion is the finest there is for supporting your back while sitting anywhere it is odd to find it under auto supplies when i think it should be under health supplies i am purchasing my second one for my office my first one sits at the dining room table always if i did a lot of driving i might also use it however my car seat seems designed for back comfort on its' own there is no way to explain how this forme supports your lower back while sitting but it does just radiate comfort because of its' shape i can only say get one ! carol d	6
1	reasonably priced used it once so far to jump start worked perfectly very well built feels sturdy \( the led charge indicator is useful \)	6
1	i 've had it for about a month now and i finally got to use it yesterday i was so impressed by how easy it was to use and how fast it worked to be honest i hate dealing with anything under the hood of my car but even in my incapable hands this thing could not have been any easier to use best of all it started my car instantly i was so proud of myself ! i highly recommend it to anyone and as others have mentioned it has sturdy metal clamps that look like they would very difficult to break the whole thing looks solidly built	6
1	several people here have mentioned that the clips are made of cheap plastic i'm happy to report that mine received march 2 2007 has all metal clips that seem to be quite sturdy ! they have definately updated the design	6
1	perhaps black and decker got a lot of complaints about an earlier edition of this item but i should note first that the one i received today has nice heavy metal clamps have n't used it yet but i'm confident it will work well i'm very impressed by the apparent high quality of construction and fit and finish as well as design frankly i think it would be a good value at the 49 99 amazon lists as the retail price but of course amazon 's price with free shipping is that much better	6
1	i have a honda which i love but since i do not drive her on a daily basis now the battery is tempermental i bought this product and have had to use it several times i 've found it easy to use and even when the car battery has been completely dead this jumpstarter has had more than enough power to get her started i comparison shopped and the price of this black decker was the best bargain too recommend it highly	6
1	i am very pleased with the purchase of the reese towpower class iii iv hitch pin lock from amazon this is a sturdy lock and will keep my usmc hitch cover secure from theft i would definitely buy the same reese lock again the boss	6
1	i wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models this gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use my favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve with other gauges you have to put in air then check the gauge put in air check it again with this gauge you can overinflate your tires a little bit then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired psi assuming this lasts a long time i would recommend it to everyone	6
1	this is great to keep your stuff from falling off the seat and keeping organized	6
1	this cover worked great kept the windshield dry ice free during the last snowstorm	6
1	this is my second item of this type and in the wintertime it is indepensible with no garage to keep my suv in this cover fills the void it is easy to put on just takes a few minutes and saves many minutes of scraping ice the next morning ! this particular one is large enough for my suv with some room to spare	6
1	really good product works well placement is important and make sure you adjust the tigger leve	6
1	great seller to deal with and the product is the best on the market	6
1	like the other user i had to use a 1x8 under tires to clear my honda civic these ramps made changing oil a breeze now i have to get rid of the old metal ramps	6
1	i have a 06 corvette and 05 explorer and i use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes they work well and seem safe and strong \( you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure \) with the vette the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage \( if you are worried about it rubbing you could use two 1x4 's in front of the ramps for additional clearance \) the ramps are about 6 25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me \( 250lbs \) under the vette nice product	6
1	plugged the unit in a few weeks after i purchased it i was heading down to va for a reunuion \( 8 hr trip \) set it up facing backwards so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan the unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas cheese and veggies cool throughout the unit is quiet did n't really know it was running unless i had the engine off could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats overall got what i paid for and the unit worked as advertised	6
1	works grest and is easy to use keeps me warm in my car since my heater is not so good	6
1	i really like using this product because it cuts the drying time of car washing to almost no time at all i hate spending a long time drying my car so it is perfect	6
1	i used one of these water blades at a school car wash and was sold the parent that brought the water blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it used it a lot it does not remove all the water you still have some small amounts that will require a towel but this is a small amount we used it on 20 30 cars at the car wash to pre dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great ! purchased one for myself so i guess that 's a good recommendation	6
1	if you wash your car yourself you should have this once you have the blade you only need one small towel for drying edges the blade does all the work for you it 's fabulous my neighbor who washes his car weekly has one and i saw him use it and was amazed at how well it worked he said he has owned a blade for years and gives them as gifts then i saw another neighbor using one i gave them to my husband and adult sons and they love them my eight year old also thinks it is now fun to wash the car that is priceless	6
1	we 've been using this water blade as a shower squeegee it is the most effective tool we 've found to remove the water from the walls of our shower it 's large and efficient	6
1	i just bought one of these for my new car it works soooo nuch faster than a chamois i can tell that i will get better at it with more use and with more use the squeegee will take on the shape of the car it dried better than the chamois that iwas using and left no water spots on the car i used the rag that came with it for hard to get to spots but that was a small amount compared to the whole car	6
1	it works great easily sheeting off water from flat surfaces i always use this prior to hand drying my car because it makes it 5x quicker with most of the water gone from the water blade i definitely recommend it	6
1	this are excellent and i can dry my suv with all three easily after a few wrings with each towel they begin to get too wet to dry efficiently i definitely recommend it for the diy car detailers	6
1	i use meguiar 's supreme shine microfiber to dry my car after i wash it there 's no lint and it gives my car an incredible shine it 's also great for windows as well i will only use this product from now on	6
1	i bought these not for my car but to clean stainless steel in my kitchen wash mirrors that sort of thing i can honestly say i 've bought just about every microfiber cloth out there and none work as well as these i can clean the stainless in my kitchen in minutes with no streaks no lint just shine and without using chemicals \( just some white vinegar and rubbing alcohol in warm water \) i probably added a few years to my life with all the time i 've saved with these cloths i highly recommend them	6
1	delivery was ontime to hawaii i order large size helmet but box said size m \? make sure inside helmet was large other thing evrthing good open type full face helmet is easy to put on head then sunglass is working good daytime i recomend this helmet for all motorcyclist if you need more safty helmet you may be buy japanese brand and spend over 350 00	6
1	i love them ! they are not only cute but practical the steering wheel cover protects my hands from the hot or cold temperature this is my first steering wheel protector and i will definitely always have one from now on this steering wheel cover seems like it will last a very long time my only concern is how to disinfect it i wonder if this is machine washable \? the license plate frame looks great and so far there 's no rust \) tip buy this package instead of separately and save some money	6
1	i already had 1 needed anotherso i bought 2 more so i would have a sparei needed one for my 1954 buick 2d h t 50s custo	6
1	well made tool can seem to be a bit heavy cleans well it was shipped lazer fast	6
1	great purchase if you like to keep your vehicle looking good and do n't have a lot of time to wash it when it is only dusty then this is a great time saver takes only minutes and looks like it was just cleaned well worth the money	6
1	i am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more as long as the surface is dry it works wonderfully once some contaminants start to build on the paint use the duster then some quick detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean my cars always look new with these things i just traded in my 2004 rx 8 after 2 5 years of using the duster and it still looked absolutely new i now use it on my 2006 lancer evolution and again the car looks brand new \( which it is \) i love them	6
1	i live in a desert climate and i 've been using this for 5 years on my corvette and it works great i use it daily which allows me to avoid the carwash up to 2 weeks in a good stretch highly recommended	6
1	i just purchase a harley davidson motorcycle and this is the best product to keep the dust off of it i live in the middle of the desert \( ft irwin \) and i always receive comments on how clean my motorcycle is kept in this enviornment i highly recommend this product to anyone who ride a bike and takes pride in the look of his bike	6
1	works great only if you have dry dusts if the dust is wet or was wet and now dried it does n't work otherwise great as a touch up dusting in between washings	6
1	well i bought this duster with a bit of skepticism having just bought a new car ! it works very well when you literally have a light dusting to remove which is what i was looking for for in between car washes	6
1	fast shipping great product very easy to use i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicatedwiring and difficult to install alarms this products works fine and very easy to work with	6
1	my car was broken into several months ago so i decided to buy the wrap it has worked so well it is better than other steering wheel binders since it has an alarm on it much cheaper than other conventional car alarms a little bulky but it does the job i really think thieves think twice when they see the huge thig on the steering wheel and the lights for the alarm i am really glad i got this product here at amazon co	6
1	super fast delivery and packaging love it thank	6
1	this thing increased the pressure 8 lbs in 20 seconds you ca n't beat that in a portable unit i wish i did n't have to screw the nozzle into the valve stem though	6
1	this package arrived very quick it arrived secure and in great condition	6
1	i received the mv50 for christams to air up my ram 1500 megacab after surf fishing i gave it a trial run in my driveway today and was very happy i dropped my front tire down to 15 psi the mv50 aired up to 45 psi in 2 minutes ! ! ! very cool with the length of hose and jumper cable attachments i can reach the back right tire as well you ca n't beat it for the money	6
1	the money shipping for this item is right this thing will get up to 125 psi no problem i have a corsair 2 5 gallon tank this lil fella i do n't know why you would need anymore ! ! ! ! thx amazon for the servic	6
1	just yesterday i got out to my car to find a tire about 80 flat within 5 minutes the tire was fully inflated saved on having to deal with my spare high highly recommend this item to everyon	6
1	compressor provides air at good rate in reasonable time frame coiled line provides convenience ac adapter would be desired addition but there must be a reason it is n't included	6
1	this little machine is capable of pulling so much current that it would blow most fuses for cigarette lighters which is why the adapter is n't included it needs to be clipped directly to the battery and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes	6
1	my mv 50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery the gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi so it is off by 5psi ! the gauge reads 0 5 10 15 20 25 at 20psi it is showing 25psi the only confusion is what i found on the internet for some people paying only 25 for this and not 70 plus shipping charges the connector is not useful for tight spaces like a rear motorcycle tire on my yamaha 650 maxim i think it is going to perform to my racing needs	6
1	i bought this compressor with the intent of airing my tires back up after a day of 4 wheeling for this purpose it works amazingly it comes with an awesome carrying case and everything else you would expect with a portable air compressor it will air up my tires quickly the specs state about 4 minutes to air up a 35 tire when running the compressor is pretty quiet and does n't vibrate and bounce around the built in gauge is quite accurate once the unit is turned off in short buy this air compressor if you have any use for it at all it will easily beat compressors which cost over 3 times what this unit does	6
1	you do n't even need windshield wipers with this and given the fact that the arizona sun usually ruins them before needed this is a very good thing	6
1	its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off i dont really buy any of those as seen on tv items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping remember this works best when over about 40mph and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea	6
1	this is the greateast invention to winter driving i 've ever found i have told all my friends and coworkers about this stuff i remember an ice sleet storm of early 05 i sprayed this on thewindshield of my car the ice flaked off easily ! ! ! ! ! ! ! pleasepurchase this item if the scale to rate this item went any higeri 'd give it as high as a 10 please i recomend this for any winter driver highly	6
1	i love rain x the rain literally beads up and rolls right off your windshield it keeps my windshield nice and clean it 's almost like you do n't even have to put on your wipers when you 're driving and there 's a light rain	6
1	i had problems keeping my tent camper battery charged until i installed this unit and it works like they say it does ! go solar	6
1	the helmet fits snug on my head no complaints about its styling there is only one complaint i purchased this helmet because i heard the horror stories of people saying there helmet would fog up this helmet stated that it was an anti fog helmet not true i still have to pull the shield up or pull the helmet up other than that its a great helmet	6
1	very nice kit and bag only drawback is that it does n't have flares	6
1	product works great ! ! ! used it up against sam 's club mechanic and it passed with flying colors would purchase it again try it you 'll like it	6
1	one of the best bargains yet that we have purchased from amazon	6
1	works great everyone needs this tire gauge it is easy to use and easy to read	6
1	works great use it on my harley and it is a perfect tool for father 's day	6
1	this was the perfect gift for a friend who constantly checks tire pressure it comes with a case and easily fits in the glove box digital readout \? no more stickey readings ! this new technology easily allows you to read and check the accurate tire pressure definately a nice gizmo gift for most anyone who takes care of their cars	6
1	this is simply the finest tire gauge that i have owned or come across	6
1	take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire	6
1	i 've been using a mity mite for three years and have never had a problem until now it wo n't charge i 've used it to jump my toyota tundra \( v8 \) and honda civic when the batteries were deader than rocks i 've also jumped my riding mower which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down \( on top of the battery jumpers and all \) to get it to start hopefully my next mity mite will work as well i wish it had an attachment to blow up tires	6
1	great item at a great price i bought two for a bit more than one at local stores	6
1	despite its size this product works wonderfully ! i have already used it multiple times to start my suv on days when the weather has dipped below zero and it 's worked every time i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced jump starter	6
1	my trusty ford escort experienced cold shock when moved from tx to pa in december it needed to be jump started the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use	6
1	pros inexpensive compact and thoughtfully designed cons no dc adapter although there is a hole for an ad on connector no power cord and you need an extension cord to to fit in the recessed a c port recommend yes ! paid 19 00 on summer closeoutcomments i bought this to jump start my 1 ton dodge rv after winter storage i 've jumpped my 1997 gmc suburban and various other cars trucks and it performed flawlessly and i live in an area where sub zero temps are the norm during fall and winter it is not a flashlight warning light battery charger air compressor or dc converter ! but it is a decent jump starter at an affordable price !	6
1	this device has saved my old car from a non start once and given me peace of mind continuously since i purchased it one note the green charged light never goes on the first time it is charged but will after it 's been charged used at least once and charged again it seems to need to learn what the full charge is before it can register properly	6
1	i live in germany and my friend bring me the autodry to germany i washed my black tahoe in the sun and it works ! ! great ! ! but you need a good water pressure that the water is strong enough to wash the hard dirt away regards from germanytobia	6
1	i bought this product for my husband he tried it out on one of the hottest days sunny and 90 degrees he is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours this really works not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing it looked as if he did the vehicles the old way there were no streaks the truck looked like it was polished unbelievable i would recommend this product to anyone buy it ! ! ! ! ! !	6
1	this is a good product for the price my only concern is when changing batteries the adhesive tape might be useless and must be replaced i recomend it for use in the closed or in the kitchen under cabinet	6
1	just be careful when using it in tinted windows they filter out the sun and the motor does n't spin	6
1	i love may cargo organizer rather that have all my stuff slide around in the trunk of my car i have it all right at my finger tips inside the organizer	6
1	bag all in all is fine the stiffners were hard to fit and two had to ne trimmed other than that it is a fine catch all for emergency item	6
1	i had a check engine light problem with my car i purchase the meter and it was able to determine the problem via the code i was able to fix the problem with 1 4 of what the dealer charges the meter saved me hundreds of dollars highly recommend it	6
1	i am surprised that the other reviewer of this product actually expected the code scanner to fix the problem my advice \? read the product description and you 'll know all it is a diagnostic code scanner and not a 'diagnostic code scanner plus mechanic in a plastic box it 'll help you if you want to repair your own vehicle	6
1	have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was mr wizard \? all the way down to the bad attitude \? only to find he has a doo dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all like a crystal ball well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball it might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the check engine light has come on big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see mr wizard sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it i would not go to oz without mine !	6
1	i just ordered this item from amazon to be used on my 1995 dodge neon however i have been searching in product description what 's in the box and have noted that the actron cp9135 comes with a cd software but thecp9135 do not have any visible pc \( serial rs232 \) conector it is true that this actron cp9135 is firmware upgradeable anyone knows how to connect and perform this upgrade \? thanks in advance	6
1	there 's nothing worse than having that service engine soon or check engine light come on this scanner can give you some idea of what is going on under your car 's hood easy to attach connector and simple navigation screens too bad it ca n't tell you how much the repairs will cost you	6
1	easy to use my car frequently has the cel for engine misfires i took it to the dealer and they said as long as it 's running ok do n't worry about it now when it happens i can clear the light myself for free	6
1	the scanner worked fine although it reads out a generic code when i went to actron 's website and signed up for lookups which go into more detail i found what i was looking for it was very detailed and helpful however subsequent attempts to enter the lookups at actron 's website proved frustrating after i had paid for them	6
1	if you are a tinkerer or a professional mechanic this tool is a must have for owners of 96 or newer vehicles youre blind without this information and can only guess at what is going on with your car i keep it in the trunk of my car so when ever the check engine light comes i know instantly what the problem is tas	6
1	read out my obdii error code with a one line description and allowed me to reset it no problem	6
1	an excellent product i bought one for my mom then tried it and bought one for myself a great back support	6
1	it works great and never falls down my dog isnt too rough with it and im not sure if she was if it would still stay up but it does what i needed it to do keep her from sitting on my brand new car seats	6
1	i have a rottweiler and a pitbull and it keeps them both in the back of my explore	6
1	i installed this in my mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived \( which was very fast i might add \) it fit perfectly the height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon so it did n't require a lot of adjusting that way the bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely i 've had my three boston terriers back there numerous times now no escaping possible ! i had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this but they were 3 times the price ! this is a great deal	6
1	this product satisfies about 95 of what i wanted it to it accomplishes the purpose keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat however the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you do n't secure them i also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward overall this product was worth the 26 or so dollars i paid for it	6
1	the lifehammer is a good product a bit small but i have seen tests on mythbusters \( discovery channel \) and it seems to work just fine i purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me if i could find this product in a brick and mortar store i would have purchased it there	6
1	i 've never had to use this product and do n't ever want to but it 's hefty enough to do the job keep it in your console box or velcro it close by not in the glove compart where you ca n't reach it when needed price is right i 've ordered one for each member of my family they say it 's the best gift so far i think that 's because it 's the thought that counts	6
1	my wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car not only does it break the glass it also has a seatbelt cutter	6
1	after watching myth busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests my father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes the lifehammers appear to be very well made and i fully expect them to do their job if ever needed the sheriffs office just recently pulled a body out of a local river his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river his girlfriends body was found right away but it took several months to find his body if they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better the lifehammer is cheap life insurance	6
1	my husband is a bmw mechanic and he drives cars all day i wish i could get him one for every car	6
1	my husband and i ordered one for all our family members for christmas they all appreciated it something people do n't think to buy for themselves it 's a good quality product i would reccomend one for each car	6
1	the tool everyone needs for the car you never know when you will need it	6
1	it is good to know there is a safety tool like this on the market having had my mother killed in a car accident where she was trapped in her car i have a better understanding of what might happen when you least expect it i highly recommend this product it is lightweight and well constructed and the directions are easy to understand and follow i hope everyone buys one	6
1	although this is one item that you never want to have to actually use i did try it on an old piece of safety glass and it worked beautifully i will keep this in my car at all times and will order the key chain hammer as well for myself and my family members	6
1	everyone should own this product i receieved my item on the day i was told it would arrive and it looked exactly like the picture	6
1	the tire stop parking mat works great ! i have tools against the wall and never could judge whether my nissan armada suv was fully in the garage or not the tire stop mat prevented me from bumping into my tools and damaging the paint on my front bumper	6
1	i do n't know what this customer is talking about when he said it smells horrible it smells like a new car not flowers or fresh air new car the stuff has worked great for me i 've been using this brand and this smell for over ten years now my father turned me onto it and i have n't found an air freshener that deoderizes and makes my cars smell new like this one	6
1	ozium 's that new car scent is the closest scent to actual new car smell that i have tried the store where i buy it no longer carries it so i'm glad i found it here i always get a lot of compliments from friends riding in my car that it smells great	6
1	for those have back pain or sciatica nerve pain you have to try this i did n't believe this until one of my colleague let me tried it for a few days it makes a big difference with my situation	6
1	i use one in the car and one in the house it works for me	6
1	this really help me on my 4500 mile trip in my toyota van i am thinking getting one for home too bo	6
1	i use this in my car while driving it takes pressure of your tailbone which can reduce back pain \( if you have lower back issues \) i really recommend this prodcut both for its function and its price	6
1	worked like a champ ! i have an rv with tires that require 115 psi this was not a problem for this compressor the rv also has an air ride system for the axels and the 5th wheel hitch this compressor had not problem filling the system to the required level good pric	6
1	this device works awesome i use it all of the time since i want to make sure i'm getting the best mileage out of my tires as possible i recommend to anyone who does their own basic car maintenance	6
1	i had used mothers wax about 20 years ago because it very good well it 's still a very good wax this wax followed by a coat of top coat reflections is just amazing glad i'm using it again and so is my car	6
1	goes on easy and wipes off super amazinglyl easy and gives a very nice finish i 'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts but the application was a pleasant experience one thing they said it does n't get the black trim white but it looks like it does the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after i applied it it is possible that it is from my previous wax but i do n't think so since i covered that with mother 's back to black product	6
1	i got the car buddies frog covers for my daughter it was a birthday present she absolutly loved them she is a big frog collecter her whole dashboard is covered in frogs	6
1	these seat covers are adorable so much better than the picture the frogs are tightly stuffed and appear real sturdy sitting up on the seat top the covers are dark green velvet like and rich looking better than any in the stores	6
1	i got two of these for the front seats of my toyota suv they are very cute just like the picture but the backgrounds are a jungly green not black which i expected from the picture however the green goes great with my interior so i'm very pleased with these seat covers	6
1	i bought this seat cover for my daughter she loves anything with frogs on it they are really cute a friend had bought her one so i said i would get her the other to match and she really loves them she said that she wished that they made them for the back seat of her car also	6
1	it is really very nice and my colleague would like to buy that too they made my car looks very comfortable	6
1	the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of it took too long well that would be because you did n't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing idiot if you follow the directions this thing works great 5 stars i would buy it again in a heartbeat	6
1	i have used this item for 2 oil changes and it seems to work well i am concerned with the longevity of the hose connections however i would be afraid that they could develop vacuum leaks over time since it is simply a matter of inserting the drain hose rather than a more formal type of attachment	6
1	i had read about evacuators on a few forums it works as described no complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts that said perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve the fill drain capability looked appealing but if you do n't need to use this device to fill fluids i would opt for the drain only device less moving parts fewer things can fail	6
1	the mityvac appears to be a sturdy well built piece of equipment i 've used it twice and it is foolproof and fast i really hated lying on the concrete garage floor in the past this tool has eliminated that	6
1	i use this for changing the oil in my mercedes s320 it performs flawlessly and with minimal effort i look forward to using it again	6
1	works well it operates a bit slowly but i assume that they all do this is not a problem and would not prevent me from purchasing it again a significant advantage of this unit is that the fluid can be evacuated from the unit w o having to pour it out others require opening the resevoir and pouring the fluid out this is useful when dealing w motor oil or other fluids that can be messy i am satisfied and would purchase it again	6
1	owning 2 mercedes it is a pain to drain normally using the mityvac you insert the hose pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil my only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid the resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum still it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it i also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use it was a real time saver on the differential since i did not have to break the gasket for the cover	6
1	used on dodge grand caravan roof rack on roundtrip from ky to fl in the rain worked great rain x is also on axius carrier	6
1	i picked up 2 of these at a local retailer they are redesigned now with the new flat key locks not the tumbler pen pickable locks works very well on both my cars my only concern is there is a lot of oil on the teeths so becareful on your new car	6
1	the dual grips are kind of handy it fits securely into place	6
1	i bought this to use on a bmw motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims it works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you ca n't see the readout the readings are consistent with other gauges which i believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described	6
1	this unit works great i bought it for my father and it works like it 's supposed to it has enough juice for a regular size crt tv and has been used to jump start a few times the first unit i bought had a problem with the generator part and would not power anything up i notified amazon and in no time flat ups was back to pick it up and i got a new unit the next day ! great service from amazon ! ! ! and a great product too	6
1	works great good price fast shipping good packaging all is well thanks larr	6
1	i have n't purchased one of these but i'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables \? or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not also how long does it take to jump start a car \? thanks in advance	6
1	hi alli am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me it has the features i wanted it to have and is very easy to use	6
1	this electromate 400 saved me serveral times i will never be with out another one love it i ordered this from amazon one day and the next day it was here very fast shipping well pleased thank yo	6
1	i have n't had to use it too much thank goodness but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind i did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great love it	6
1	fortunately my brother was nearby when i had a flat he pulled the electromate out of his trunk hooked it up to the flat tire in about 20 minutes i was safely on my way to get the tire repaired i swore i would buy one just in case he was n't there next time or worse yet if i got stranded without help anywhere the jumper cables are a plus ! ! i highly recommend this item to anyone	6
1	this unit is even better than i had expected i read the reviews of those who have used it and decided that it was the better of the b d 's that were also available a little pricier but with the many features it makes it worth the all in one package i was surprised it had dc plugs \( for things you usually plug into the lighter \) mostly i was looking for a c plugs and a jump starting capability \( for road trips camping etc \) a great deal especially with the amazon automotive promotion 20 off 100	6
1	only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump otherwise i'm very pleased with this product	6
1	this is an all around great emergency product for both car and home they only thing is that i wish they had the dimensions so that i could have assessed whether it would be too big or small	6
1	seems that amazon does n't want to sell this item because they do n't tell the most important thing about it that is that it 's a 0 60 psi gauge to be used for tires needing about 30 psi give or take 10 the illustration is incorrect but they show the same picture for all the different moroso gauges i measured accuracy against a digital and it 's within 5 psi best thing is that it makes a perfect and instant seal with the tire put a little extra air in press the button and it 's an accurate fill i think the rubber cover is a must amazon 's is the best price	6
1	this cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm it does n't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat so it does move around and fall forward when i get up otherwise i'm happy with it	6
1	this little gizmo really does work it seems to be pretty accurate too although it 's tough to tell you need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading i 've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work unfortunately there 's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading if there 's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath still for the price it 's pretty darned impressive you 'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions are n't very accurate	6
1	saved me twice so far tow rope got me out of a snow bank has almost everything you need some things are kind of cheap but in general the product gets the job done	6
1	this is the best ! ! ! best store best service fast service and great packageing i will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	6
1	perfect for my needs stores well in my saddlebags i saw it five dollars cheaper at auto zone a few days after i received it but i'm still happy with the purchase	6
1	i rate this product a 5 star although i have n't used this product yet decided to purchase it as a result of the review of motorcycle tire inflator 's in the motorcycle conumer news just wanted to have one to carry in saddle bag of my hd ultra classic in case it was needed	6
1	well i bought two of this i have only used one and it works fine looks very nice and feels solid in your hands the only thing i dislike is that it sounds and vibs too much for my taste but not a big deal	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
1	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	this is great for the outdoorsmen ! bring it on your boat camping blow up a raft this is the ultimate gift for your man ! especially the outdoorsman he loves it and it is a great price it is good to have around the house too	6
1	i use it for the air compressor i just wish the gauge would be easier to read the numbers are too close together and to smal	6
1	i love my tink visor it matches my tink seat covers and floor mats i wish it held more cd 's though but it holds the typical amount for a visor \( about 10 cd 's \) i'm very happy with this purchase	6
1	since my daughter loves everything tink and the local auto parts store did n't carry this tinker bell style i decided to buy the one amazon had it turns out that she loves it and it hold the cd 's nice snug too very well made	6
1	it 's great just the perfect size for the visor and i can still pop open the mirror easy to install with the velcro and the cd 's stay in tight and easy to remove	6
1	works just as advertised but requires a bit more light than just sticking it on the outside of the light cover by tucking it under the cover you get a nice bright blinking dot no batteries no outlet no transformer brick	6
1	the laser parking system works great ! it took me 5 minutes to install and now my wife can park her way oversized suv in our garage with little problem no kidding there is 1 inch to spare in the front before she hits the shelves and 3 inches in the back so the garage door can close with the laser she hits the mark everytime	6
1	i bought this from northern tool for 9 00 and found a much better product than i expected the 75 watt bulb in my door opener powers the solar cell without a problem guess andrew got a defective unit or is trying to use this with the light guard over the bulb it must be in direct view of the bulb the laser points to a spot on my dash allowing for perfect parking every time	6
1	i recieved the mr clean auto dry system for fathers day im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place and one with the incredible claim that this product makes that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel well quite frankly i was very skeptical about this products claim i used it today and was very impressed it took about 10 15 minutes to dry but when it did my beautiful silver car looked better than when i used a shamois it was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes i would have spent drying the car i am a big fan of the auto dry system and will never towell dry again	6
1	i own a cleaning service and was not satisfied with the current stainless steel cleaner i was using all the other cleaners you need to buff until the streaks are gone but with sprayway it glides on and that is it love it nikki madison wi	6
1	i have been in the housekeeping business for six years i ran out of my stainless cleaner today and used my clients it is the best i have seen there is absolutely no effort to apply this product and the results are fantastic two thumbs up for sprayway stainless steel polish you have my business from now on	6
1	i have a stainless steel table top and was very disappointed when trying to clean it with standard household cleaners most cleaners would only leave a dull finish and streaks i saw this product specifically for stainless steel and tried it the results are stunning a light spray and quick wipe with a cotton cloth leaves a dramatic bright and shiny surface no rubbing no scrubbing no fuss it 's worth it to have this one trick pony in your cleaning arsenal	6
1	they arrived well packaged and in perfect condition they certainly look cute on my yellow mazda ! i would recommend more people to personalize their vehicles with license plate frames the plastic molding seems sturdy thus far and have held up nicely so far ca n't tell the difference between metal and plastic frames	6
1	this item topped of the entire matching set i bought for my van ! ! we love all the tree frog pieces we purchased	6
1	it was simple to install on top of my rv i was able to put a cover over the panel and keep getting the sunlight to charge the batteries it charges even through glass on the inside of the rv	6
1	acts more as a flashlight than an area illumination which is ok if you need another flashlight and no more illumination in closets	6
1	these little dots work great and stick anywhere the light is very bright watch you do n't blind yourself i sometimes have a little difficulty pressing so the light stays on but usually after 1 try it 's fine	6
1	easy to install and reliable even dropped it in the water and no problem still working even immersed of course i had to dry it but it was easy to disassemble	6
1	we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard one tap it is on and another it is off leds are the way of the future	6
1	i love this thing very convenient and can go mostly anywhere super bright directed light	6
1	these ramps work well with my lowrider saturn i can get up on them without scraping the spoiler extremely light a major improvement over the old metal ramps i used as a kid	6
1	i use them whenever i do n't feel like putting my car on jack stands the rubber feet fell off quickly but they did n't make much of an improvement on traction anyway so no real problem very durable i'm pleased	6
1	i have had 2 different auto ramp systems prior to the rhino ramp 8000 i had the same problem with both sliding as i was trying to drive up on them with my car or truck or riding lawnmower this does not happen with the rhino ramp it stays in place and does not scoot any i recommend this ramp system	6
1	solid sturdy what can i say it has a simple job and it does it well	6
1	i received these for christmas from my boyfriend \( note to girls only put things you really really want on your christmas list \) they work we were able to change the oil in my volkswagen golf w o scrapping or having any other catastrophic emergency the only bummer is that you ca n't stack them within each other for storage	6
1	great product light weight stores easily does n't need much room will fit under low stance vehicles used mine under my subaru and did n't scrape the bottom of my car highly recommended product	6
1	since auto tire guages have the potential to be bumped dropped etc this protective boot is clearly worth two bucks it slips on snuggly and does n't block meter readings or hinder gauge use in any way if you own an accu gage you should get one of these	6
1	i'm not a car enthusiast and i hate having to wash the car but ever since we got the california water blade washing has been fun and fast this baby dries the particular area of your car you swipe instantly no fuss no waiting time no repetitious hand motions just a beautiful shiny dry a bit tricky to work in the curved areas but not impossible it 's one of the best car accessories we 've ever bought	6
1	we got one to use on our cars a couple of years ago it wipes them almost dry it does n't scratch because it is made of silicone now we are using it in the shower and have to buy another for the cars i'm getting one with a handle to dry my camper too i recommend them highly	6
1	the product is very nice it blows up a tire within just a few minutes the only bad thing is the cord that goes from the cigarette lighter to the tire is n't quite lone enough it is great for cars but it wo n't reach my back tires on my truck	6
1	fit snugly over the seats in my brand new 2007 toyota corolla s model very comfortable material nice colors with black background i love it	6
1	this just topped off our entire set now i have every item that goes with this set amazon is the only place i was able to find all the pieces	6
1	very affordavle very convinient beautiful design that match my car sit i am very happy with this cushion this is the best cushion that i ever had thank you	6
1	this is a cool bag and it does n't have to be used for litter	6
1	this oil pan is great for changing your oil multiple times depending on your kind of car or truck it is easy to work with not too large and will help you save a lot of money on oil changes being that doing it yourself costs around fifteen dollars versus the fifty dollars it will cost you at a mechanic plus oil changes take only around fifteen minutes and you can dump your oil at any local mechanic like jiffy lube or grease monkey you ca n't go wrong with this oil pan	6
1	received product as described within several days of order item is excellent quality and does the job	6
1	this product was great and makes metal sparkle i will buy again	6
1	the mothers powerball mini powerball are outstanding recommend it to all car collectors we just loved the way it works and the time it cuts down to polish crome wheels used the big ball on the pro street wheels and the mini on the front we 'd still be polishing if it was n't for the mothers products great buy	6
1	i bought this for 'just in case' scenario it happened about three weeks after purchase dead battery on my pickup previously i had followed the mfg 's recommendation instructions for a newly purchased unit and unit was fully charged this thing is great i had to jump start pickup 3 times before finding out i had a defective battery and needed to replace it kept me from being stranded it is simple and foolproof to operate it has worked form me and sits in my garage fully charged again it is cheap insurance and saves having to call a friend or a tow truck for a jump start i wished i had purchased earlier good bye jumper cable	6
1	got three of them for the shop they have been used this winter and they work great got them at a great price with free shipping should have got another one ar	6
1	this is not a cheapo chinese product made very well works great very very good price	6
1	it 's what i will need if the car battery is drained i hope i never have to use it	6
1	very helpful and easy for anyone to use i no longer have to call towtrucks to start my car when my battery fails me the money it saves me is put to better us	6
1	this jump starter has the capacity to jump start diesel engines and everything else i 've used it on i only wished it came with the cigarette outlet cable that is an option if it also had that i would have rated it with 5 stars	6
1	this product is great now i no longer have to guess where to stop when parking with limited space in our garage i was always stopping to short and the garage door would n't close or to close and hitting the garbage cans now i no longer have to guess great bu	6
1	this product just arrived i am very impressed by the quality of the material and the zipper i have adjusted the roof rack on my fj cruiser and may put something in the bottom of the carrier for support we will see if that is needed this product is cheaper and of higher quality than those seen in department stores	6
1	this carrier worked well on our honda pilot it kept several large suitcases dry we used several large bungee cords to secure it the only problem was that it made noise but we taped them down the fabric kept them very well protected i would recommend it for anyone needing the extra space in their car	6
1	the carrier held 2 huge suitcases and several other duffle bags and packages we went thru a snow and ice storm on a 1200 mile trip toorlando and there was not a drop of water inside i also purchased a bungee web to put over the top for the extra security and this worked out well there was no wind noise even when traveling 75 mph great item	6
1	i am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000 mile tour from nebraska to florida with this on the top of my subaru and i must say it was great thing to have everything stayed bone dry and secure but i would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure plenty of room and solid construction for the price it ca n't be beat	6
1	i purchased this bag and drove over 1600 miles in rain and snow the product performed wonderfully i noticed small water droplets when i finally opened it after six days this may have been due to opening and closing the bag to take things out during the trip i really have nothing negative to say about this bag if you need a bag for your car roof buy this one	6
1	i knew we needed this thing with 7 people crammed in a van but i'm short so i was leary no problem it saved our travel experience and wore very well easy to work with well worth the price which was n't bad to begin with	6
1	we purchased this item to travel to the mountains for christmas we drove 7 1 2 hours in the pooring rain our luggage stayed completely dry it easily attached to our mini van luggage rack and stayed secured the duration of the trip this bag is awesome and reasonably priced !	6
1	our first experience with a cargo carrier was over christmas we were really counting on it and things worked great it is very spacious easy to pack and stores nicely	6
1	this carrier is very good only one draw back the zipper only went around on two sides would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap	6
1	it does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location i had to remount move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position the forward backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me	6
1	this parking assist works as described its easy to install but the laser does n't stay on long enough and even with the car in motion the light sometimes goes off before the car comes to a stop because it does n't detect motion on the smooth one color surface my wife ca n't see the light on the front of the hood because she line of view is lower than mine however i find it working fine	6
1	this little gadget works well ! it 's easy to install the motion detector works as advertised and most importantly it does help us park our cars accurately in our crowded garage i tried other devices but they did n't work i'm glad i bought these little dealios they 've made my life infinitely better my wife is happier and my dog likes me again	6
1	the park smart mats work that is if your 're a good aim really these mats need to be about twice as wide the mats are about a foot wide and as you are pulling up to them you can not see them because the hood of your vehicle blocks your view consequently if you 're not lined up perfectly you 'll drive right past them that being said they 're still the best non electronic item on the market for stoping your car where you want it	6
1	overall i am satisfied so far i have not experienced creep but i move my car into position very very slowly so that may help my one suggestion is that it could be wider it is easy to slide by if i am just a little off line i have yet to try it on my boat trailer so that will have to be covered later	6
1	i 've used gs27 on two cars of mine that had scratches i 've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches it really depends on the scratch and how deep it is it works like magic on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches it works alot like a car wax as far as application removal you have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine the only reason i do n't give it 5 stars is it does n't completly remove all scratches	6
1	this is a fine product the 3 led bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination i ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom i left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when i chose to shut it off you will not be disappointed with these awsome	6
1	do n't confuse these with the cheap ones going around cheap ones have only 1 led light and no batteries these come with batteries and have 3 led light in each unit i bought these for a bookshelf and curio cabinet i have come up with 1000 more uses and ordered 12 more you wo n't be disappointed i have been looking for these for about 2 years and finally found them	6
1	i received 2 multi outlet adapters for our cars plugged them in to each car and the adapter has a red light indicator that it has a 12 volt feed the items i plugged in work without problem	6
1	works very well i suggest screwing the mount in as opposed to using the supplied tap	6
1	i recived this product about a day or so before christmas it was in perfect condition will order from you in the future thanks	6
1	a must have ! ! well you can live without it but if you do n't mind spending 20 25 bucks for a skt holder this is the one well made versatile and it does what its supposed to hold the sockets in place magnets make it handy as a shirt pocket	6
1	does a good job for what it was designed for did have some trouble recognizing certain types of batterie	6
1	works fast and good this is a great charger anybody can use this the voltmeter and of battery indicator is nice i do n't have to check the battery with my multi meter hav n't used the alternator tester yet but have no doubt it works by far the best charger i 've seen and used however it is noisy but who needs total silence in a garage	6
1	this unit has done everything i expected of it and it was not overly expensive considering the features	6
1	this is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor high quality and easy to use	6
1	after trying every wiper from the 2 wally world variety to even the most expensive bosch wipers i 've found performance and longevity was actually about the same throughout the spectrum of windscreen wipers i was very disappointed in how long they would last \( about 2 3 months of perfect wiping \) before purchasing a set of the icon wipers for my volkswagen golf i was about to spend a few hundred on oem wipers aero from the r32 which seem very similar to these after more than six months of use i am glad to say they still perform very well and there is yet no need to replace them i only wish bosch would make a 13 version for the rear window	6
1	i was able to put this on myself i really love my steering wheel cover will definitely want to get the other accessories	6
1	this is not only a nice tinkerbell accessory for the car but a quality steering wheel cover also the material appears as if it should hold up nicely and the graphics are nice	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
1	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	these are a girl's must have ! ! they look even better in person ! ! they are very soft and velvety ! ! i absolutely love them ! !	6
1	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6
1	i have a nissan sentra so i guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars i had the easiest time to put it on it popped right on it does n't slide around either i bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day it 's a beautiful steering wheel i got seat covers to match with it amazon has the best price i definitely recommend you guys to buy it i usually do n't write reviews so this is how satisfied i am with it	6
1	i love tink ! i found this item to be very easy to put on my van steering wheel it does not slide like others i have had before but easy to remove too	6
1	if you love tinkerbell this steerling wheel cover is a must have ! it was a little difficult to put on but it looks very tinkish ! i love mine and plan on adding more tinkerbell stuff to my truck ! oh and if you plan on taking it off good luck it 's pretty sturdy and is meant to resist sliding but i love it !	6
1	very impressed so far used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly never impressed with black and decker tools but i think they got it right this time time will tell and i would have given it 5 stars if it holds up for a few years	6
1	you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	6
1	i 've loved this product since i first got some from my dad in many years ago forget the car i use it in my bathroom ! stepping out of a shower and being able to see in the mirror is great no more trying to blow dry the mirror or wiping with a towel only to leave behind wet streaks and having the mirror re fog again this is the greatest i almost thought they stopped making it because i could n't find it in the last 2 automotive stores i visited \( it came bundled with the regular rain x for windshields also good \) but now that i see it on line i know i can buy it again	6
1	i received this item in great condition ! will order from you again in the near future thanks	6
1	this yakima roof rack system works great and i highly recommend it i bought one for my mazda 3 and have used it along with a yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips \( i live a florida skiing is far away \) the rack has n't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car	6
1	everything a mechanic needs without having all those little bottles and cans leaking every where the sticks allow precise application of thread sealer or anti seize the sticks do n't leak or spill the y do n't have nozzles that clog they are perfect no waste ! they were a good deal before but now with the new low price you can afford to get two kits ! buy this and you will not be sorry	6
1	this 16 ft coleman jumper cable is a 4 gauge cable which is a mechanic 's grade it is durable and will last a long time the length ensures that you will be able to utilize this tool without worry the clamps glow in the dark and fit both side post and top post batteries it comes with a lifetime warranty and i am very glad that i bought it	6
1	this spray will drown out anything works great in the car spray for 1 second in the center of the room and it freshens for hours i do n't smoke but i 'd bet that ozium would easily take the smoke out of the air just the same i know some people do n't like the sweet strong smell but i think it 's growing on me	6
1	i dont know what i had on my car before these but they were nothing compared to these blades i bought them because they were cheaper then the euro blades that are popular for volkswagens but they still have the same look i couldnt be happier they sweep everything away its a much sleaker look then braket style wipers i recomend these to anyone who either wants a good wiper blade or a nice euro look to there car	6
1	1st of all i am sure that everyone has hated how ugly the winter wiper blades are they are bulky and just do not look good now the icons are sleek and small they look great ! they perform awesome in all weather conditions \( i have used them in rain sleet and snow and in a blizzard \) they handle everything perfectly no annoying streaks and they sweep everything away the do not miss anything ! ! sure they are more expensive than other blades but you really do get what you pay for ! awesome wiper blades i would recommend them to everyone	6
1	this item is great cause its tinkerbell but when i bought it they said it was for cars and vans it did not fit my van seat	6
1	this is an excellent starter kit wish i could buy more clay separately as the have plenty of the quikwax if you have very used clay this is absolutely worth buying and trying	6
1	i got these as a gift and my mother n law loved them	6
1	ths is exactly what i needed i have so many 12volt dc products i need connected at the same time and this definetly helps i like thati can mount it where i need to and there is a good sized cord that comes with it the built in led power usage indicator lights are nice especially if you have your engine off and your woried about your batter if it goes from green to orange start your vehicle and you wo n't have to worry if your battery is going to die	6
1	the life hammer is of a solid construction and one can see that it is a quality product i got one of these after seeing it on a episode of mythbusters the amazon glow in the dark version is pretty neat and works very well this is a saftey item that i feel is well worth every last cent	6
1	i had been looking for a new gauge and really had my eyes on an analog dial type i found one surprisingly hard to find at local stores so i was thrilled to find this one on amazon and at a really decent price this accu gage model is simply great solid construction and finish it 's the perfect size perhaps the best feature is the release valve function which holds the acquired pressure reading from your tyre until you press the little thumb button to release the air pressure from the gauge ca n't say any more about it other than 'works and looks great	6
1	while my wife refuses to put it on her white van she loves it and even i get a kick out of it	6
1	love this item second one i bought purchased one for my dodge ram then sold it bought new nissan titan and wanted another receiver step as i left the other one in the ram i sold	6
1	i have had this for a couple years now and recommend it to anyone	6
1	i installed this item on my 2001 dodge truck shortly after i purchased my truck in nov 2000 i have not had any problems with the unit at all my key fob has worn out though it has seen some abuse i installed the unit myself using their instructions the install did take longer than i anticipated but mostly because it sometimes took a bit to find the correct wire in the truck in all it has great features at a fair price	6
1	i have a 2005 ford ranger i bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install after that i began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit i went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout the unit installed well worked fine after initialization came with a video that really helped in the installation i find the range on this unit to be super i have no complaints	6
1	this unit does exactly what it says reads the codes and allows you to reset the check engine light it also has software to intrepret the codes but this is very basic in nature and you can find the same info on the internet or from some car mnufacturers the unit is very well built and easy to operate	6
1	i bought this reader when my engine light came on turns out i could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part the dealership was going to charge me over 100	6
1	the product does just what it says it does it helped me realize my mechanic was milking me for 800 00 when i could have fixed the problem myself for 107 00 when i confronted my mechanic he said nothing because he knew he had been had	6
1	i purchased this pocketscan to diagnose my engine light and it does work once it picks up the code you can then repair saves money compared to paying a mechanic to do it and charge loads of money and it can erase the check engine light once the item is fixed its basic but what more do you need also easy to use	6
1	do n't bother with the more expensive units that display the explanations of the codes this is all you need there are plenty of sites in the net that can tell you what the codes mean for each vehicle works great for getting and clearing codes if your check engine light is on this is the tool for you highly recommended	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
1	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	this is a great product for mirrors and windows ! love it so much i buy in bulk and the delivery was fast	6
1	i have never had a problem with it at all i take it on jeep trips to air 33x12 50x15s back up after dropping the pressure to make the jeep go in the sand better that unit that wo n't go past 15 lbs pressure surely has a problem just last night i aired up four trailer tires to 80 lbs each seems like the farther you push the fitting on the valve stem the faster it will fill the tire i like mine a lot	6
1	this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats 1 you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you also it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire it is a bit slow 2 you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running i liked it for what it is	6
1	this is a great convenience i have 2 of them to hold my ez pass in different cars much better than digging around for it and holding it up ! the only thing i wish is that it came with additional adhesive i had to get my windshield replaced and i ended up having to buy another one because it would n't stick to the new windshield	6
1	the product was in very good condition and it was delivered very promptly	6
1	this windshield shade was exactly what i was looking for and has provided an easy and effected way to shade my cars windshield by blocking the sun and reducing the temperature in my car on hot days	6
1	great product ! this tool is very intuitive and easy to use i find the greatest value is in having the mil codes internal to the device which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips i bought the obdii fault code book but quickly learned that i did n't need to have it	6
1	a real bubble bath for the car smells great cleans greatonly flaw is its hard to find in stores and cost more than the usual car wash but somethings are worth it and this is one of the	6
1	i was about to buy an escape hammer when i spotted this keychain rescue tool i like that it is small enough to store close to the driver 's seat fortunately i have not had the need to use it	6
1	an excellent tool works perfectly easy to use and was able to diagnose and facilitate correction of several nuisance trouble codes in a tundra	6
1	bought this spent 15 minutes studying the manual plugged it in and it worked first time read out the check engine code and when later plugged into a pc allowed the details to be printed in a nice report the only negative i 've noticed is that when you reset the check engine code in the car 's computer it erases the reader 's memory of it so you have to do the pc printout before resetting the code some folks believe that if you use a device like this on one car it 's locked in to that car and ca n't be used on a different car this is not true i 've used it on several different cars with no problems	6
1	tool is very easy to use just plug it into your obdii connector turn the key and watch it record the fault codes then plug it into the usb port of your computer and your done software is intuitive and defines all codes captured by the unit and then allows you to create a printout one use and it 's paid for when compared to the hassle and expense of taking the car to the shop also prevents fraud since you can tell the shop what is wrong	6
1	this item is easy to use the codes were easy to read and could be transferred to one 's pc via the usb cable provided i do not have much experience with other code readers but ca n't imagine one easier to operate and erase faults with than this one for the price i could not be happier my only negative comment was with the pc software it did not allow for saving the list of codes downloaded from the reader in other words if i wanted to keep this info for future reference i would have to print it out a minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product	6
1	i am a professional technician this little handy dandy tool is fast easy and gets to the point of the problem with little to no issues self powered and can tell you current codes pending codes as well as what monitors have been run comes with a nice booklet that explains how obdii works and has a code chart for most cars well made ive had mine for a few years now its far easier to use then most top dollar scan tools cannot show sensor values in real time clears codes yesshows codes yesshows pending codes yesshows if monitors have run ye	6
1	this product was very easy to figure out and use i found my problem code and reset it with no trouble whatsoever a very complete manual with a good amount of background material to explain the whole obd code topic	6
1	the code reader is a very good device with an excellent price i fix my car and i saved money the diagnostic for a car is almost 80 dollars in the auto repair shop with that money i bought my own code reader	6
1	used this tool on 2001 odyssey gave me the code and fixed the problem it was egr related took it for emission inspection and passed used it also on my 2003 mitsubishi montero sport also used to check my relatives and friends car	6
1	i have been using this cleaner since my brother worked for a car detailer about 10 years ago and discovered it it is the best for glass truly streak free it is awesome on stainless steel tile painted wood sealed varnished wood porcelain and more i use it for everything i'm showing a house right now and this stuff is perfect for keeping things sparkling with minimum effort \( though you should see my paper towel budget lol	6
1	these seatcovers are great ! my car is a funny color and it was hard to find something to coordinate with the fit is perfect ! definately something you want for a change of pace	6
1	i was pleased to find this item at amazon i purchase the identical product at a well known national chain b c i wanted to protect at least the driver's seat of my vehicle i liked it and later decided to order another one when i saw it on amazon the item came securely packaged and the quality is the same as the one purchased in the store the gecko design really is quite cute if you're into cute that is and i find these covers quite adequate at prolonging the seats of my car i would recommend this item	6
1	i bought this to polish the aluminum wheels in my 85 celica it works so good and it is so easy to use i have been polishing lots of other stuff just for the fun of it and the results area great	6
1	we love our lund tri fold ramp ! it 's a great product at a great price ! it 's very strong yet lightweight enough that one person can handle it we wanted a ramp that was one piece for stability its solid design offers good traction along with worry free loading of all items no worrying about anything slipping through like it could with an open ladder type ramp the anti slip rubber pads and safety straps make it very secure the longer length provides a more gradual incline than standard ramps this adds to their versatility around the home they 're so handy for moving items even up and down stair	6
1	this ramp set is just one heck of an item traction is great and if wanted each of the three ramps can be used alone or all held together by an easily removable rubber hinge system i like the ramp because it can be used with small wheel products like a lawn mower track machines like a snow thrower or even as a great loading platform for my road king motorcycle i recommend that the 77 length set be purchased if you can store them easily because of the hinged attach platform to the vehicle and easier load angle enjoy ! !	6
1	i purchased the tink decal along with a several other tinkerbell car accessories for my daughter 's first car the decal is so cute i received the decal in record time and paid no shipping ! the price on amazon was great !	6
1	this is the only snow removal tool you need to have in your car very lightweight compact and durable wo n't damage or scratch your paint and reaches the highest suv would n't be without it	6
1	love it it 's effective especially when it snows a lot i like that it 's so lightweight makes other snow brushes seem heavy and clumsy	6
1	used one for several years saves the paint on your vehicle and removes a lot of snow with one swipe	6
1	have n't used product yet but i'm glad to have it for next year	6
1	this worked very well in the record setting east coast snow we just had the long handle reaches all the way across my mini van did n't mark up my car the way our old snow brush would great item ! if snow is making your day sad sno brum will make you glad	6
1	i finally got a snow brum after living in the northeast my whole life i ca n't believe i 've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush and this is a required tool if you have an suv and hate having 50 pounds of snow slide down your wind shield when ever you hit the brakes you can clean off your entire car in about 1 10th of the time and this is great for the deep snows too in short if you have snow you need this	6
1	i 've lived in oregon colorado and now the northeast and seen my fair share of snow i got one of these from a friend two winters ago and it 's the best tool for snow removal i 've used i still have my ice scraper since this wo n't remove ice but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18 24 inches that we got in the northeast last year i'm buying one for some florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year	6
1	this is a great product my neighbor got one and i 've been trying to find them in the stores to no avail all it is is a sturdy plastic platform mounted pependicularly to the pole you use it to push snow off your car as opposed to brushing it off it 's much easier to use than a brush because you push rather than sweep i'm buyingit	6
1	my dad also bought this wax based on the ratings in consumer reports as others have mentioned the cr review was right on it went on smoothly and has a pleasant scent it took a little more effort to buff out but it was easy to remove from any black plastic rubber trim although streaking was more than usual the shine was amazing ! three months of parking outside in the sun and some rain and the paint still shines and feels like there is still wax on it highly recommended	6
1	with all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate so waxing is still important i recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection i have been following cosumers reports recommedations three years ago their recommendation was nufinish liquid this year cr recommneds black magic liquid automobile polish the liquids are easy to apply and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes in my opinion the black magic is at least as good as the rest i like the cherry scent	6
1	rated best polish in consumer magazine and probably is one of the best the problem is it does n't work unless driven by a human who 's going to invent a car polish that works by itself	6
1	excellent product for the price use a pre wax cleaner 1st \( mother 's 1 \) then apply goes on easily but do not let it dry too long before buffing it in leaves a nice deep glossy shine i 've put 2 coats on so far this year the car looks great	6
1	this and turtle wax carnauba car wax t 6 tied for number 1 in the june or july 2006 issue of consumer reports	6
1	i read about this product in consumer report and was exactly as described went on smoothly shined to a bright finish the wax provides a durable coat	6
1	you can clean any kind of metal with this product i think you should buy it for the most part it 's like copper and silver polish only it 's intended for metal sometimes it may leave a few streaks here and there if you do n't wipe the surface of the metal entirely if that happens apply a touch of water and continue rubbing until the streaks go away	6
1	i purchased these covers for my '77 toyota fj40 they fit the truck seats and made a big difference in it 's looks they seem to be made well and will service my purposes until i can have the seats recovered	6
1	the wires arent that long so youll need to get some longer ones and getting the speaker wire through the firewall is a hassle but after you get it set up its worth it its very loud	6
1	this thing is lots of fun i like driving through the crowded parts of down town atlanta and putting the loudspeaker on the sound of the frog croaking also i like rolling up on crack heads and flipping on the police siren for a second that 's funny the bad thing is that the wiring is not very long to connect the speaker to the box so you are limited to where you can install the thing	6
1	this product is awesome the other review says that it 's not loud which is false it is extremely loud and if installed by a automotive electrician or someone who has some experience in car electrics this product works beyond expectations this is a must for any car owner	6
1	i love my new seat cover it was very easy to install over my seats nice product	6
1	very comfy and warm my only downfall is that i could have sworn i read that two came in one set i ordered one thinking i was going to get two covers i have to order it again darn	6
1	product seemed good got is as a gift for my mother but she decided to get a different color the item was actually nice though	6
1	i bought these a couple years ago to hide my ugly bucket seats they feel very soft and look great since they fit snugly it is helpful to have some help when installing them they do attract hair etc so they do have to be periodically cleaned	6
1	this keychain is great its wonderful quality and the price was amazing you really would n't be able to get a keychain like this at this price anywhere else ! if you are looking for good quality key chain for your jeep this is the one ! its a jeep thing	6
1	good quality gets the job done and sure beats the price at the jeep website	6
1	i like the multi position feature of this product it does n't get in the way by sticking straight out of the dash and you do n't have to unplug everything to access what it 's turned in front of	6
1	this is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney it could last longer and attract less dirt though amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free	6
1	excellent little assortment of parts here it 's not for everyone but for those who can take advantage of it it 's a nice ensemble all the hardware is of decent quality and appears durable many of the parts would be hard to get for half the price i bought it at a discount price and really had very little trouble seeing high value in it even at the regular price you would be hard pressed to duplicate it for double	6
1	i recently bought one of these to put in my wife 's car the kit is pretty complete and well organized you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but i liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor the bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it wo n't slide all over a carpeted area	6
1	this is a great gift for a used car owner very handy	6
1	comfort beads will change the way you drive your vehicle it 's almost like you 're floating on air i 've been using them for over 15 years i sure am glad there 's a company still manufacturing them awesome product ! i highly recommend it	6
1	this car wash mop far exceeded my expectations in performance it cleans car surfaces very well and makes it very easy to wash car or trucks handle is comfortable and mop holds lots of water and suds and another good aspect of this mop is that it is made by a trusted company who always make quality products so i have found and have come to be a regular consumer of meguiars products i will be coming back here to purchase replacement mop heads very soo	6
1	bought these to replace the factory blades on my mazda3 very very happy with these blades the difference is unbelievable installed easily look great and get rid of water so much more effectively than the blades i replaced	6
1	a very decent soap for the price and qty delivered i have used soaps where the suds will last longer and form with less water so i give it a 4 rating to be fair any better soap will cost the same amount and will give you about 1 4 the amount so i can live with re sudsin	6
1	this is the best car wash i have ever used ! ! ! ! ! along with the nxt generation car wax it makes your car look like it 's had a brand new paint job this product is a must for people who want the best for their car	6
1	this is my favorite wash to use on my car it suds extremely well holds the suds well and the smell of it is quite pleasant i was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes leaving you with a bucket of dirty water obviously not too good for your car ! with meguiar 's nxt everytime i finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles i highly recommend this product	6
1	i just used this product to wash my car and it worked great as it is advertised a little goes a long ways \( 1 oz per gallon \) the suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy it is also easy to rinse off and after washing my car 's surface felt slick as well	6
1	the plug is heavy metal and of good quality very impressive looks good	6
1	easy on and off can apply it in the sunlight makes my viper shine and the shine lasts a long time	6
1	the price at amazon was more than 5 less than my local target store the wax is a liqht liquid that 's not only easy to apply but easy to remove as well i was able to wax my mercedes convertible in about 30 minutes for best results i would use a microfiber towel to remove the wax and for a final polishing the shine is incredible and it leaves the paint feeling silky smooth although it 's only been a month since i waxed my car after 4 washings it still looks great this is certainly the best wax i have ever used i highly recommend this product	6
1	meguiar 's nxt tech wax is easier to use than any other wax i 've ever used and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red honda like no other as well buy it use it love it	6
1	i own a detail shop i have tried many products over the years and have found the polymer products work the best i use zaino as my main finish protectant but did give nxt tech wax a try i always try new products on my own cars before any customers i waxed both my 2004 auto 's in the same weekend 1 with zaino 's and the other with nxt tech wax as far as i can see the nxt went on and off as easy left as deep a shine and seems to stand up to the eliments just as well as the zaino 's with the only real difference being price i 'll be using the nxt tech wax from now on	6
1	the suction cups stay well on the window i like the fact that i can adjust the size and it does n't have all the cutesy pictures the only problem i had is i forgot i had it on at first and i opened the car window the suction cups busted off and got lost inside the door forever next time i 'd try one that does n't need suction cups or supplies extra ones !	6

1	this charger works great a charging a 12v battery it is very small and has two small clamps to attach to the battery if your battery is in an out of the way spot you have the option of attaching a 2nd set of cables which attach to the battery permanently then you just plug the charger into the loose end of the cable when done charging unplug hide the cable	6
1	i have an older version of this charger that i bought in the mid 90 's i used it to maintain my garaged mustang 's battery over the winter months for many years i made a cigarette lighter adapter so all i needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips i have to say this thing is dead reliable ! it always kept my battery in prime condition i love it and recommend it highly	6
1	now i do n't have to worry about a dead battery just plug the battery into the tender and i know the battery is going to be fully charged for the next start	6
1	if you have a vehicle that you do n't use very often use the battery tender to keep the battery charged it slow charges your battery then maintains the charge it works great	6
1	this unit is a workhorse for the money i use it on my corvette in the winter and in the summer i have my snowblower attached to the battery tender this product is compact in size and simple to use it came with different adapters that enabled use with different battery charging requirements i recently gifted a unit to my father in law who leaves 2 cars in florida year round a must have for anyone who has a vechicle or seasonal piece of equipment	6
1	this is my second battery tender that now maintains my v rod my first tender is over ten years old and continues to function on my son 's bike very easy to use and nothing to worry about	6

1	i love my tink floor mats ! they look really good and are supposedly easy to clean	6
1	this is one of the nicest tinkerbell accessories available the graphic is amazingly vivid and should hold up even under the worst of conditions the mat itself appears to be very good quality i do n't expect any problems with this item	6
1	simply put these are the best wiper blades i have ever used when they wear out i 'll buy another pair regardless of their price there is no better wiper blade on the market period no streaks no skipping or sticking to the glass and they lay flat even on the sharply curved windshield on my '63 galaxie buy them you wo n't regret it and they 're a better deal than rain x liquid	6
1	after much research and trial and error this product rocks ! be certain to clean and rinse well before applying to a dry top jf	6
1	these are very cute tinkerbell dice for your rearview mirror they are a little smaller than average dice but i like the size they are even better cute accessory for my car	6

1	i ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work overall they work fairly well no problems jumping our work trucks chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford f150 's the light comes in handy the air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire and the hose is kinda short but it does work other than that it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see i have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges it recommends charging them once a month even if you do n't use them 4 5 star	6
1	bought mine at walmart \( usa \) came in a box that looked like it had not been opened however when i arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary \( mexico \) the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices walmart was great and mailed me the missing parts 48 hours later after the initial charge i was back in business both clamps are metal and well built yea walmart and yea b d	6
1	i purchased this exact model and both clamps are metal maybe it was an issue and they have changed the material seems very well designed and built much better quality than the no name brands i saw elsewhere	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
1	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	arrived in timely fashion product was exactly as described i carry it in my pocket everywhere	6
1	i got the item quickly it installed easily and when it rains it removes water from the windshield which is what i expected it to do no complaints	6
1	i got a couple of these a coupld weeks back after watching a mythbusters episode about submerged cars for my wife the unit is small and easily added to here key ring i hung mine from the seatbelt in my car i had some tempered glass laying around my garage so i gave it a quick try it worked as expected with just a little bit of pressure the glass was punctured and immediately shattered i highly recommend this device especially give its low price	6
1	i am a firefighter and find the tool not only useful but space saving and extremely functional as well	6
1	it is a great item i just hope that i never have to use it	6
1	that 's the best tool small and yet powerful ! i tested it ! resqme is my safety buddy	6
1	excellent for the every day driver i got it as a gift and bought 4 more for my family	6
1	i am very pleased with the solar shed light the long cord makes it easy to use in any spot mine ended up under a kitchen cabinet it gives off a very nice light	6
1	this super bright light is great ! its solar \( no need to string wires from the house \) it has a very bright light \( sometimes solar lights can be on the weak side but not this one \) a person could attach it to other places outside to it does a great job peircing through the dark night definiitely a must own if you have a shed or dark spot in the backyard	6
1	this is adorable it 's nice fabric and really creative but a little difficult to put on my seat securely	6
1	the same with the frog bucket seatcover very nice staff for just 15 bucks	6
1	i collect fairies and was delighted to find this seat covers i got them and they match wonderfully inside my truck \( grey interior \) however my seat belts are located on the seat \( i have an 03 gmc envoy and i think a lot of gmc trucks are this way \) so pay close attn before you buy this product	6
1	these seat covers are allot prettier then the picture just recieved mine today and i am very pleased	6
1	the colors were prefect for my car blues and grays the soft velvet gives it a touch of richness the image is pretty but could be a little better quality and well with the embordary the colors in the seat are more on the purple side and all the other moonsprite items are blue so not a prefect match over all i am happy i got it	6
1	they are extremely nice seat covers the quality is great for such an inexpensive price but they were huge in a jeep wrangler with no way to modify them to fit and had to be returned universal seat covers does say on package fits most so if they fit i think it is a good investment	6
1	it is always hard to judge a product by a picture they looked dark on my computer but i ordered them anyway because i liked the graphic i am so glad i did they are actually a steel blue and they look great i am very pleased and have recieved many compliments they were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations i would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys	6
1	i searched for new seatcovers only to find hawaiian flower prints in almost all automtive stores then i found amy brown moonsprite seatcovers these were reasonably priced and were not some flower print there 's more to these they have a soft feel to them like velour my last set were nylon and some days would develop static and shock me every time i exited the car the other thing isthere are other products like floor mats that have the same moonsprite logo	6
1	the seat covers are great exactly what they look like in the picture and what i wanted i would definetly buy other things from amazon as long as they are this well pictured and the quality is amazing	6
1	i have an acura cl types and i got this steering control when i got a pioneer avic d2 the unit was n't too hard to setup the manufacturer 's website is pretty helpful i did notice that it sometimes is pretty slow to process my steering wheel button presses rarely it also completely ignores them i have to let go of the button pause and press again even with these little issues i still like the unit mostly because i can use my left hand to control the volume while my right hand is reaching for the phone or whatever else	6
1	this ashtray is made solid i like quick extinguishing feature and if you open the lid all the way the led at the bottom lits up i wish the led was attached on the lid though overall great ashtray	6
1	because my daughter and i love tinkerbell this was a cute and inexpensive addition to our growing collectio	6
1	i did n't realize this item would be as well made as it is great paint job too ! my 9 yr old daughter loves it good christmas gift stocking stuffer	6
1	i am pleased with this frame no logos and has a clean stainless steel look about it my only issue is the bottom part of the trim is a little tall and so oregon plates which have a registration sticker tag that goes at the bottom of the plate is hardly visible	6
1	i have bought cheap blades at drugstores they do n't work well this one is truly quality easy to install and it works better than any wiper blade i have ever purchased the price is low for such a great product	6
1	ordered mine directly from motive products for about the same price mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective after emailing motive they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing the unit worked as advertised a bit slow but be patient remember to warm up the engine a bit \( as directed in the instructions \) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out beats crawling under the vehicles and struggling with the oil pan nut ! will try bleeding brakes with it next time	6
1	this yakima roof rack system works great and i highly recommend it the fairing definitely makes the ride a lot quieter anyone who does n't like wooshing should buy one without hesitation i bought one for my mazda 3 and have used it along with a yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips \( i live a florida skiing is far away \) the rack has n't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car	6
1	i tried the rack without the fairing the noise and turbulence was tremendous once i installed the fairing the noise and wind buffeting dropped to a point that i forgot the rack was on the car excellent product well worth the price	6
1	this product works well and saved me lots of money it is easy to use	6
1	it covers a wide range of older vehicles the connections are straight forward the more the operator understands about the vehicles system the more useful the tool	6
1	had scanner for just over a year and have used it on chrysler dodge and ford both obdi and obdii vehicles works great ! simple menu driven instructions and pick lists make using this scanner very easy to use	6
1	i have used this about 10 times now and it seems like a well built and designed unit that will suffice any garage or diy mechanic i am impressed not only with the hardware but their support seems to be top notch as well i would recommend this item over the typical auto store scanner that is found at the retail level this unit is also can certified and ready to go	6
1	just a comment about the eagle talon comment in order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics i have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy i was a jeep eagle technician for many years even though it says eagle on your vehicle it is actually a mitsubishi eclipse that is why the connector does n't work at the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars \( there were others \) also obd1 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like abs etc if they are not linked we also had different connectors and equipment for different systems	6
1	scanner saved me a lot of time and money i was able to find out what was wrong with my motorhome without taking it to a garage	6
1	i purchased this item for my father it has definitely paid for itself ! just a heads up for those planning to purchase this item the scanner itself is cp9145 not cp9150 i had 2 of these delivered and thought i was sent the wrong product each time according to the manufacturer a cp9150 is a cp9145 with extra cables included which allow you to test a greater selection of vehicles hope this helps	6
1	this series of diagnostic tools does not handle abs i am not certain why whether the reason is merely a lack of software firmware support for abs or a physical interface issue regardless this tool has an easy to use menu structure and connectors for any imaginable vehicle	6
1	i have to agree with the product description this is a top quality product that makes a big difference at least for my car it shines after just one appliance and i am very satisfied with the final result highly recommended	6
1	way to easy to install ! i had it installed and working in a few short minutes if your looking for a new hoen to replace those little mortercycle type horns they put in cars these days than this is the one you want mind you this is not the real loud awsome toned air horns you find on big trucks but it is good enouph to scare the heck out of a moron that cuts you off \) highly recomend these for the price ! great value	6
1	good scent but it does n't last more than a week	6
1	been waiting for my parts supplier to carry this item for a while seen it on audis and other german cars for a while and adverts on various car mags etc if your thinking think no more buy it !	6
1	i like the looks of these wipers the low profile puts them out of my line of sight they seem to work as well as any premium wiper blade but i have not had them long enough to tell how well they will hold up they are a little expensive for a wiper blade so i would hope they will last longer than a standard style blade time will tell	6
1	i drive a special needs school bus all day all year and have had this cushion for some time they are light and easy to move between vehicles i get about two years out of it then just buy another do n't spend more you do n't have to	6
1	thie is a convenient pack of cable ties i figured every home needs cable ties and this is a perfect assortment of colors and sizes	6
1	i was very pleased with this charger i was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low my van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out after reading info about other chargers i decided on this one i read the directions connected it and it did the job i called black and decker and they were very helpful with any questions i had this is a small price to pay for the convenience certainly better then having to call a tow truck it 's portable and lightweight stores easy i never charged a battery in my life and i was able to do it	6
1	they are regular bungees just hard to find this size in the stores good for small needs	6
1	great for cars that no longer install ashtrays example honda traps all odor once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it 's also easy to use at night i do n't think it 's a great ashtray but a great disposal system if a ld light was installed it would be even better for nightime use	6
1	we looked everywhere for a trash can for our van this was the only one i could find that was what we were looking for it fits perfectly in our van and never tips over	6
1	it 's solid and heavy as a rock yet to see the purpose of this item defeated working great so far it 's just a bit heavy to handle at times	6
1	if you want to call the atention buy this and people will laugh a lo	6
1	my husband recently installed this in his car and loves it it was a fairly simple installation and works just as promised	6
1	this set of paint is nicely done but only because the blue i was looking for was just a bit too bright for my blue on the jeep mixing black and blue wont hurt to make a shade that i need	6
1	it took me a while to learn to use it properly but when i did it worked wonder	6
1	living in central texas is does n't rain a lot but when it does you 'll be glad you used this product it also works well when you need to clean your windows with the automatic glass cleaner featuere that comes with most modern cars i suggest using a decent micro fiber towel when using and of course cleaning the glass before you apply rain x also the 16oz bottle will last a very long time	6
1	great product used it for 5 years now limit the streaking by two ways using a spray bottle lightly mist a paper towel then buff the glass after product dries after streaks are detected just use a dry cotton cloth \( towel \) and buff the streaks out not that difficult to have streak free glass but the streaks will be annoying during night time traveling	6
1	this could be a life saver item for anyone that lives near or around watery areas where you could be in the position to save yourself or someone else that has wound up in a body of water and their vehicle is sinking	6
1	purchased as a just in case and i hope i'm never in a situation where i will need to use it but at least i feel safer knowing it 's there i 've only tested this on pieces of wood and plexiglass and it works as it should this tool was also highlighted on an episode of mythbusters on the discovery channel in a submerged car myth they demonstrated how a tool just like this one and the lifehammer both worked perfectly on the side window of a submerged car so i'm sold on this tool 's ability	6
1	does the trick for illuminating what 's in my pick up crossover bed tool box could use a more flexible mounting system including magnetic mount tap screw mount batteries last long due to low power requiermen	6
1	these are easy to use and easier to tighten than the pull through type tie downs these will work well to hold a riding lawnmower or golf cart on a light trailer they are also good in pickups to hold your load if you have loops inside the bed if you 're hauling anything heavier on a large trailer get some serious tie downs like the keeper 05516 's	6
1	i bought a pair of powerballs i used one yesterday it performed just as advertised my drill and the powerball did all the work for me wiping the residue off was no problem it 's a great time saver i highly recommend the poweball to anyone who 's a fanatic about their wheels	6
1	this scan tool includes can diagnostics works on all 1996 and newer cars and gives diagnostic faults codes live data values freeze frame information and also records and logs data a vehicle diagnostic report is able to be printed with the software that is included this software also allows each of the recorded files to be uploaded and graphed on your computer the red yellow and green lights on the tool quickly indicate whether or not an obd2 vehicle is ready for an obd2 emissions test this tool will save you time in diagnosing vehicles quickly	6

1	the scanner worked as promised the only thing was i had no place to plug the scanner in on my computer to solve the problem i bought an adapter plug from the nine pin on the scanner wire to a usb which i can plug into the computer i'm still working on getting past just reading error codes and clearing the check engine light	6
1	i bought this scanner as a xmas gift for my dad he 's tested it on his gm pickup and my mom 's pontiac it sync 'd up with the cars and worked as advertised the only reason why i do n't give it 5 stars is we have n't had to use it for any serious diagnostic purposes yet and that 's why i bought it	6
1	for less than 200 you get a reader with a large backlit screen and one that can also give a live data feed from your car 's sensors it also supports can \( controller area network \) which by 2008 will be a new standard a standard that ford and foreign auto makers have already adopted did i mention it also comes with a serial cord to connect to your pc \? this is a very fun diy toy you 'll enjoy for years	6
1	smaller is definitely better when it comes to power balls i bought the original one and it worked well but was hard to get into the smaller portions of my wheels i did not use the extension rod much i still used my dremil in some of the corners but if you want to polish you wheels with less effort than just a rag and some elbow grease it is much better the polishing compound that comes with the set works very well also	6
1	i got fix a flat for all my daughters my elderly mother myself and my husband i certainly hope the product works but i feel better by having it in the trunk	6
1	i 've used this product for the last 10 years i keep one in my trunk at all times the fix a flat will work on small holes the size of nails shake it hard then add it to the tire like an air hose the tire will inflat enough for you to drive it to a local gas station for air	6

1	all of my 2 hitch units work fine with this adapter i downsized from a suv with a 2 and went to a compact car with a 1 1 4 this allows me to use my bike carriers luggage racks etc	6
1	not to sound like a copycat but it does what its supposed to do read codes erase codes run low level diagnostics you probably ca n't run a repair shop with it but it certainly will add a level to your shadetree shop	6
1	i 've used this actron cp9175 autoscanner diagnostic code scanner with freeze frame data for obdii \( post 1996 \) vehicles on a 2001 lincoln towncar and a 1999 bmw z3 in both cases the device performed flawlessly and i'm very pleased with the ease of use	6
1	i orginally bought this at an auto parts store and realized that evening \( after getting home and doing some online reasearch \) that i could buy it on amazon com for almost half the cost that i payed at the auto parts store so needless to say i returned the one that i purchaced at the auto parts store and bought from amazon com it 's a great investment ! saves from having to go the the dealership to have them run a computer on a vehicle	6

1	i was tired of buying new wipers every few months i live in minnesota and the salt and cold quickly wear out wiper blades i have used these for a couple months and they work great in sub freezing temps best of all they do n't squeak when they are on the cherry on top is that the blades carry a five year warranty !	6
1	i have tried many different wiper blades on both my car and my wifes i thought i take a chance on these after reading some of the reviews all i got to say now is wow ! these blades are whisper quiet and clean the glass so well i am very impressed we had an overnight sprinkle and when i got into the truck the next day the spots were all dry a few quick wipes with the washer fluid and it was almost crystal clear ! ! 5 year warranty these have to be the best blades out there !	6
1	these wipers are of the finest quality they do a wonderful job of clearing the rain from your windshield i highly recommend them for replacement of your current wiper blades you wo n't be disappointed in these excellent wipers i 've tried many these are the best and they 're made in the usa	6
1	great wiper for toyota avalon fits perfect works smooth and cleans better than original	6
1	i 've had it three weeks and nothing has come loose yet seems to be doing the job	6
1	this is the first clay bar system i used and it 's still the best you absolutely need to use this before you wax or else you 're just waxing those impurities into your finish creating more annoying swirl marks doing this step before you wax is a bit more work but it 's worth it i could live without the mother 's wax they include with the kit as i do n't use it but i always use this before i wax my car that glass like feeling your paint gets is amazing	6
1	product is just outstanding really deserves the 5 star rating it has in amazon my vehicle had tree sap mist all over its finish i tried many diffrent waxes even tried compond and nothing i was begining to lose hope until a little research on the net about clay bars and ran into this product it took me about 3hrs to do my entire car and although it was plenty of work i could not belive the result its a mirror finish the paint looks gorgeous highly reccomend this treatment	6
1	this product removed overspray in about two hours and saved me a ton of money i was lucky to find out about this system and highly recommend it it 's easy to use just wash and dry your car and then in 2 feet blocks spray the lubricant and gently rub the clay bar on your car wiping off excess lubricant and finishing with the wax included in the kit my car looks like it did when it came off the lot ! could n't be happier	6
1	i first bought the mother 's clay bar system a year ago it sat on the shelf until i tried it on my two year old honda cr v it took less than 45 minutes to treat and wax my whole car and the vehicle now looks better than when i bought it you can actually hear those little rust causing impurities coming off the finish stop destroying your clear coat or settling for less than a perfectly smooth finish get this product ! i do not own stock in or work for mother 's car care prducts	6
0	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
0	i bought this for 30 from best buy what a waste of money ! the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it the sound quality is terrible ! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300 what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i'm just sitting in my car people can barely hear me over the background noise racket	7
0	junk junk junk mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working	7
0	i went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working people regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone could n't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no '	7
0	design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled find an alternate hands free piece	7
0	i owned two of these earbooms the fit was comfortable and the sound very good however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	7
0	i have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear it 's unobtrusive and light however i constantly get complaints from whoever i'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet i have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset the problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth	7
0	the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me it 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end i'm not happy with these	7

0	going by the plantronics name i bought a pair of m60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone they are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a try she got a nasty feedback squeal several times during a long call essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far we ordered a sennheiser pc120 to try instead	7

0	does not work with verizon v3c when i plug the phone in it says unauthorized charger and refuses to charge at all it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars if i could i would give it zero stars i suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing maybe it works in china but not in north america	7

0	junk junk junk mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working	7
0	i went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working people regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone could n't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no '	7

0	i bought this for 30 from best buy what a waste of money ! the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it the sound quality is terrible ! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300 what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i'm just sitting in my car people can barely hear me over the background noise racket	7

0	the product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces only the plug in portion came no usb cord i then requested a cord and webtreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came i emailed their customer service again and have received no response fyi it works to charge your ipod too	7
0	this case does not work well the case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week	7
0	looks nice protects the i860 very well but i 've only had it for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months which i rarely used the swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets the cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera it has to be held down away from the lense body glove needs to send this one back to the engineers	7
0	i never got my order even after a month after i placed it they reply to you email with false info always saying its on the way one item that i did get was the wrong item you have been warned be very careful from these guys	7
0	worthless it rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off flimsy and broke within a week not even worth the 0 01 i paid for it which is sad	7
0	poorly made and weak pulls the battery off my razr everytime i disconnect it from the holder stopped using it within a day after purchase there are better holsters for the razr on the market avoid this one	7
0	title says it all phone falls out clip swivels badly justtrash	7
0	service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates dont get it ! you will end up paying the same if you have a plan	7
0	i would n't recommend this product to any one the phone cover really sucks i just used this product for a month and the clip cover peeled off really disappointed with this purchase	7
0	i agree on it was too good to be true statement for this package the material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap ! thecharger melted in the car after a sunny day i could n't even test it earphone quality is not good as well giving a constant humming noise the case is the best out of these three so far so one out of three for 10 bucks i am not recommending anyone to buy this item	7
0	the case and ear bud are fine but the car charger i was sent does n't even fit my nokia 6230 that was the main reason i bought this package	7
0	this deal was too good to be true of course i was n't expecting any name brand stuff here but at least i expected them to all work i do n't know if i got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used the case i did n't need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed the power adapter seems to work fine so basically i spent 9 99 and am only using the power adapter i guess that 's a good enough deal i think i 'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud headset though	7
0	the skin is a great idea but it is not practical it is too thick to work with the seidio cradle i have so i must pull off the skin to sync my treo the skin buttons do not always line up with the treo buttons so i misfire applications the holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time i pull the phone off the holster do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly	7
0	the skintight cover is cool works pretty well with the unit but the belt clip sucks ! it 's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa	7
0	the headset really has bad sound quality i missed the reviews before i ordered i should n't have bought it considering the quality of the headset i did n't even try the car charger in the fear that it would n't follow the necessary battery charge cycle	7
0	this stuff is n't even worth 14 99 my husband and my aunt could n't even hear me it 's a piece of crap i sent it back the same day don't buy it ! !	7
0	i got this as a gift its too thin for me i m not into the credit card sized phones picture quality sucks its hard to manage it the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the my content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone !	7
0	i bought this item to protect my new motorola l6 first of all it 's a cheap piece of plastic would break if dropped second and more important my phone doesn't work with it on ! the plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone beware don't buy	7
0	it looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily the shipping was fast and the price was right	7
0	i tried to cancel the order but they said it has been shipped i was cancelling on october 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on october 17 2006 how can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped	7
0	you get what you pay for do n't bother with this at all my car charger did not work at see other reviews on the problems w the leather case save your money	7
0	i have n't tried the hands free device and probably wo n't bother but the case is cheap looking and the charger did n't work at all as they say you get what you pay for ! i'm going to an actual store and get a real motorola accessory kit do n't bother with this one	7
0	i read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer 's ear i figured at this price i 'd try for my wife and i when i first tried them on i instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on even with the provided clip these fall out and you 're better off not using them frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive	7
0	samsung has a great phone with the black jack unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one unique to samsung phones therefore you are forced to buy samsung 's headset bottom line do n't bother the design is horrible the earbuds do n't stay in the ear what makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear i hope that samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones	7
0	i think this is the worst nokia phone i have ever had it just does n't seem like it 's nokia quality to me i would get the samsung slider if i could do it all over again battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough the interface is pretty smooth but that 's about it if you have to have a simple interface then this might work but otherwise i 'd get the samsung	7
0	i got this phone cause i thought it would be a nice little phone wrong yes it plays songs yes it is little too little ! ! ! ! this phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers the voice dialing does not work ! it is hard to use i returned the phone after only 2 days ! i got the samsung t629 totally better does almost everything the nokia does but is better looks better performs much better if you are a teenager this phone may be good for you the samsung even sounds better get the samsung same price more phone	7
0	it was broken in a few days of use you should buy a hard cover instea	7
0	this headset is not compatible with the nokia e62 ! the nokia e62 has a 2 5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory	7
0	for 4 it 's not bad but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you do n't care how the case looks then this is the case for you	7
0	snaps on easy but snaps off easy too it also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do this case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line	7
0	this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you do n't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo	7
0	saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece so i took it the installation was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with an lg chocolate it was functional tested it out all over the house and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet used it driving and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels not a quality bluetooth earpiece look to motorola or jabra for a decent one	7
0	this product alone does none of the things listed in the descrption by itself you must still buy other software to use it when i questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it does n't do they pointed out where it says may require 3rd party software for various uses i just did n't know that the definition of 'various' was all uses we have listed i would rate my experience with this seller as dissapointingat least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere	7
0	i know from experience i have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years i think one company makes them all they will not last the cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out for some reason it only happens with the palm type cables my ipod and usb retractable cables have lasted perhaps one just ends up using the palm device cables more for hot synching and or charging daily see my palm page at	7
0	i bought this cable my first peeve was that it was shorter than the original palm hotsync cable but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place so watch out and treat this cable nicely i like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged	7
0	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
0	this holster offer 's your phone zero protection not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster while it does allow the phone to swivel thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated i ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement all in all i would not recommend this holster i'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak	7
0	while this is a functional holster be aware that you may like me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster i know i know you can turn off the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone you may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely	7
0	i chose virgin mobile thinking they would be a good company i have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life in multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people i never got the same answer twice it was a nightmare i ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money i feel stolen from i would never do business with this company again huge mistake in the first place	7
0	my husband and i found these cases for our new slvrs and were excited unfortunatly like others we have found that they do n't fit our phones we have the right style slvr the case just does n't fit	7
0	i purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr l7 it does n't fit the case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone do n't waste your money	7
0	i bought three of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3 5mm headset for listening to music but they did n't handle calls at all everything is full of static listening and talking i just placed a call with it and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo i would never use these for calls	7
0	samsung a670 is a lame phone also the battery life is not good it did n't have many features so its just a waste of your money the ringtone volume was too low i would suggest samsung improved this phone i am not sure if i ever want another samusung again i have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust	7
0	this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670 when you put it in it reads bad battery on the screen and will go no further	7
0	i do n't know about other company but accessory export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture i bought a genuine contour leather case for motorola razr v3 but what i got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic there is no leather on the case at all not only that the cover smells like petroleum oil	7
0	this is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone the outside is a faux leather made of plastic that looks convincing enough all told it is an acceptable choice trendy	7
0	this worked for only a couple days although the belt pocket clip held my treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way after a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time after a couple more days it was useless save your money on this one	7
0	i 've owned a tracfone for 3 years my old tracfone quit working so i purchased a new one i 've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new tracfone it 's been a nightmare after 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to tracfone customer service reps i 've accomplished nothing my phone is still not activated i still do n't have my old number transfered and i 've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps i do n't recommend tracfone	7
0	got it home put in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone once it was charged i went to activate the phone it said insert sim i redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understand my error when i got a person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to send me a new phone mind was broke so we will see if the new one is better next week when it comes	7
0	we 've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year very inconsistent service when calling our son i would get a message that his number was blacklisted after calling cingular several times we demanded new phones not lg1500 we were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing so we 're getting a different brand if a phone does n't work the company needs to get rid of them !	7
0	i got the phone because it was small but i did n't know i 'd be sacrificing so much the speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day i get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and i can see thru to the casing all in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but it 's not really the best for what you 'll want to do with your cell phone	7
0	i paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards the phone will say insert sim card even if it is inside it recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped there is a very minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games you cannot change the mini display save your money because you might end up spending 40 50 bucks on sim cards and another 50 for a replacement phone	7
0	my wife and i got two of these phones for free when she switched to cingular after two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly my phone was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues i know service is not the problem as i had a samsung phone through cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas sometimes i 'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back i do not recommend this phone even though it is was free it 's not worth the frustration	7
0	i got this phone in january and i had to take it back the day i got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls they gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone but it was n't the one i have now is n't as bad as the first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly do n't buy this phone	7
0	good case functional charger headset not compatible with the nokia 1100 ! ! ! completely different connector type look closely at the product photo	7
0	totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly bulky this just makes it as lot more so even worse you cannot attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and or loops in the design !	7
0	the construction is shoddy very bad quality leather made in china my phone \( cingular 8525 \) would not even fit in it the design itself seemed awkward it went straight back to the boxwave	7
0	the usb cable and software did not work for the sony z525a phone purchased through xcingular the phone will not connect to the pc the phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable uninstalled the software and tried again with firewall shut off same result connecting a usb device should not be this difficult	7
0	i bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market the sony ericsson w810i within 2 days the case already started to crack and chip i dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case the case also scratches easily too the only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish but i have a feeling that i am going to have to replace it pretty soon bottom line this case only protects against scratches i was actually looking at the clear silicone cases	7
0	my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day	7
0	unless you have a cd with a program that is specific to your phone this cable	7
0	first the part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws second no fixed belt clip third only the case is black all other parts are clear plastic bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spent 35 dollars on shipping guess i got what i paid for now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund	7
0	when i first got this item i was very pleased it was so cheap and it looked great it snaps so easily on and feels really cool however after about 3 weeks the duller not so shiny coat that i liked on the cover started to come off beneath it was a very shiny black coat i was so disappointed i took it off and went with my original cover it looks really bad and just looks like something i 've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks i am very displeased with this item	7
0	i have a ux245 as you can tell from the item name this product should have been compatible with my phone however when installing the cd you are asked to pick your phone from the list my phone was n't even on the list then i got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if i continued to download however who wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item ! ! ! ! ! ! !	7
0	do not order from this company the cable does not fit in the phone unfortunately i did not read the reviews before purchasing from eforcity the cable came a few days late when it arrived the cable did not even fit the software for the cable was defective after it had finished installing windows xp came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system eforcity is awful	7
0	the only support i received was to send me to a competitor 's homepage and try to download their software	7
0	the cable worked that 's about it the software provided did not work and it did not include the vx8300 model \? ! there was no contact information for the manufacturer and i spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver plus i had to find software to use this thing	7
0	i was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own the cable itself is o k but i had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it 's definitely not intuitive and definitely not plug and play support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor 's website to locate the drivers on my own also \( and with no offense intended \) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you	7
0	it took a week and half to receive it 3 days to get confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail then there 's a single protective screen pre cut in a plastic it does n't cover well the whole screen surface \( it 's about 1 2 mm narrower \) and it 's very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath i had to take it off immediately then once removed from place it 's a waste	7
0	i bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it	7
0	this cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting i do not recomend it it costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it i will chalk this up to you get what you pay for	7
0	the case fit well but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart i'm very gentle with my phone but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one it no longer stays on so i threw it away the bottom is still on great but it dos n't do me any good without a top !	7
0	i ordered a three piece set of an earpiece phone cover and car charger for my motorola i860 phone when i get the order the phone cover custom supposedly was too small for my phone my earpiece worked temporarily then it started shocking me now it does n't work the only piece the one i did n't need that worked was the car charger i'm very unsatisfied	7
0	net10 cell phones are great but do n't buy this card net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards i put the pin in my phone and did not receive the minutes i called technical support and received 1000 minutes i was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that i will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days don't buy this card	7
0	i put the multi clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape i found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also the case is great but the accessories suck poorly made with light weight materals save your money	7
0	this clip came with the case that i bought for my palm treo phone the second day that i had the case i lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it was n't able to be fixed i am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner i would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk i do n't know if it was just my clip or if all of them are made poorly	7
0	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
0	this adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed but it did not even fit it its totally false information being given for this item will never purpchase it from this merchant ever cant belive amazon has these untrustworthy merchants	7
0	i guess you get what you pay for this charger works but apparently not quite the way sony ericsson would like it to when using this charger my se w300i often reports charging errors this never happened with the original se charger \( which my dog ate hence the new one \)	7
0	a very basic phone with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper did not recieve the usb cable i am going back to the nokia 6102i	7
0	i must live on the edge of cingular 's \( and everyone else 's \) coverage area this phone ca n't hold a call at my house and i have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength part of the problem is the coverage area but part is the phone too i have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem if you live like i do in a pothole on the information superhighway avoid this phone	7
0	i'm on my 3rd v 180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it \( under warranty \) for another unfortunately they have the option of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fix someone else 's problem phone and pawn it off on you this one is going to get flushed as soon as i find another phone to buy since cingular says it 's now out of warranty and i'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months	7
0	i had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular not worth its mone	7
0	we were excited to find such a good deal the clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse the home charger never worked the car charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package one thing my boyfriend and i learned through this experience is to pay for known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and time	7
0	for a good price of approximate 4 50 \( as i recall \) plus shipping i ordered the bargaincell brand new ikross retractable car cigarette lighter adapter it did not work i suppose i could have packaged it up and sent it back \( at a cost to me \) and probably received a replacement but for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time i 've resorted to using a standard car recharger	7
0	i bought this usb cable for cingular my lg cu500 but does n't work with it strongly i do n't recommend this others	7
0	this product does not work ! ! ! ! ! ! it is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer i wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer no way ! the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it i have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work i dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is the disk has 40 files on it i dont know if one of the other drivers would work but i am very frustrated	7
0	i bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone the new one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does ! i have to charge it every day whether i use it or not i feel ripped off to tell you the truth	7
0	i only buy it because i must to have a battery backup for long trips and i ca n't wait for the seidios battery	7
0	well the only good thing one can say about the treo 680 battery is that it 's thinner the battery for the treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day as the treo 680 battery only lasts a 4 5 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable i'm really dissapointed that palm delivered such as lousy battery with the treo 680 but happily there is a quick fix buy 1 2 more batteries and keep them charged and do n't leave home without them	7
0	unlike the other review i can not recommend this at all the gps regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites \( sometime longer \) the palm needs to be resynced \( bluetooth \) with the gps at least once a month when it does work its great though	7
0	i purchased this to replace a lost holster the first time i tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams	7
0	the battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone it was a pirate product and worthless unfortunately i discovered it after the expiration of the amazon return date	7
0	the case looks horizonal but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom	7
0	although it 's listed under the accessories section for the v66 it is not for the v66 well i guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra battery no sense in having this if it does n't charge the second battery i checked it out on the motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one this charger is the motorola spn5029 which does n't work with the v66 and 2nd battery the correct number is the spn4970	7
0	the price is high considering that there are newer models	7
0	guys do not take this sheet piece for god sake i am repenting on it \( please take my advice thanks	7
0	i bought this for my lg mint chocolate vx8500 when you go to install the driver you 're supposed to select your phone from the list well it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete and my phone was n't on there which probably means that yours wo n't be either do n't waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone	7
0	the product arrived fine and on time from accessoryone but the cable would not stay connected in the usb port on my computer i had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected i threw this cable away and wound up buying verizon 's music essentials kit for my lg vx8600 the music essentials kit provided a cable and driver that work fine	7
0	i took a chance and it didnt work for me i have a lg vx 8600 had to return the product good luck to you	7
0	thanks god that the phone can survive a moderate fall the case pops open very easily and despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that another disappointment the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again you guessed it falls	7
0	advantages 1 \) superior protection i have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case 2 \) all buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to in cases disadvantages 1 \) signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case ! 2 \) belt clip useless since the case can easily open spilling out the phone when on one 's belt 3 \) side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons \( above start and ok buttons \) summary usable only for protection during transportation and does this well phone should be removed from case during usage	7
0	same comments on the latch opening easily my complaint about the belt clip it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use would n't buy again	7
0	the latch is pitiful the phone fits nicely but that latch is not secure with in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer 's house tons of fun watching your 500 pda hit the ground and the battery come flying out phone is ok but the case is getting replaced asap ! ! do not get this case !	7
0	i dropped my treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case	7
0	i have a lg vx5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with was a no go product would not install from enclosed cd computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed usd cord a loss of time and money i have since ordered received and installed from another product data point from another vendor	7
0	maybe it 's because this product is not approved for windows but i could n't get it to install	7
0	yes the cable fits but the cd driver is just for the 8300 i was not able to get it working	7
0	the cover does n't fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom it also falls off from the clip today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car this is a poor quality product and i would n't recommend it to anyone	7
0	these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped the software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time	7
0	i ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life after about 1 2 months of use the thing shorted out and would n't work any more i decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured i 'd give it another chance the thing did n't even work out of the box this time i only wish i could give it zero stars spend the money on a motorola brand charger instead	7
0	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
0	i bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the sony ericsson z500a \( this model is listed in the description \) first off the cd that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it making it useless i figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from sony ericsson 's website after downloading the software and following the instructions to a tee i was still unable to link up my computer with my phone i even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case i made an error all told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with amazon	7
0	chargers work great and are a great bargain however the generic lg driver software that comes with the usb cable to transfer music from computer to phone does n't have an authenticity signature i do n't know about other computers but mine with windows xp \( sp2 \) wo n't accept it	7
0	the sound is low static ky and it frequently dropped calls boo	7
0	do n't waste your money after 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2 year service agreement i opted to purchase a new battery waste of money ! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re charge nightly that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery nightly re charge	7
0	this battery was no better then the old battery it replaced when phone was new battery life was good not sure what is the problem maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use vendor service was good or maybe just a bad battery	7
0	the headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wo n't work with the katana the case is absolutely worthless do n't waste your money on this product	7
0	the software that comes with this is not the right software for the vx8500	7
0	havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it not too sure how it works its not showing my phone on any of the software programs \( after i hook it up using the usb cable \)	7
0	the nokia bl 4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032	7
0	i was extremly disappointed when i received this it did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can i had one of the first razor phones and it did not fit when i got th belt clip i went to cingular to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip that did n't fit either i would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar with shipping cost it costs about 6 00	7
0	the case broke the very next day that i got it	7
0	you will still need to buy the ac cord for this unit this is not a charger it 's essentially a 30 00 piece of plastic that holds the q upright	7
0	i bought this product about a month or two ago and i still have n't been able to figure out how to use it i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use this product seems to be a lot harder unless it 's the wrong data cable which it should n't be since it 's advertised as an env data cable	7
0	do not buy this item ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i havent even dropped my phone or hit it against anything and its cracking on all corners	7
0	i received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item there is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue led that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less best buy while certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent you should realize that what you 're going to get is not what is pictured unless eforcity fixes things that is	7
0	bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline should n't a cell phone battery last longer than a month \? \? they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i 'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same	7
0	i 've had car chargers before for other cell phones and never experienced any problems i was attracted to this one by the low cost but i guess you get what you pay for it lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether	7
0	the charger i got did not fit the motorola v188 wrong connecter i was offered a full refund	7
0	this product is not what its cracked up be if looking for a screen protector look elsewhere i can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad waste of 10 and customer service wo n't respond to my email matter of fact email to customer service did n't ever deliver	7
0	the product broke the first day i used it i'm going to have to be more careful i think they are all cheep	7
0	bought a cell phone battery that of course died one week past their return refund deadline refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again consider yourself warned	7
0	this is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen i attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the cingular screen with a new lens cloth once specks of dust touch the adhesive they 're there for good and the protector is ruined i gave up because i was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than i was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid ! save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in	7
0	i have had to exchange my pink verizon motorola razr 3 times ! ! ! ! ! ! luckily i purchased the insurance i'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr \( this last phone only lasted a few weeks ! \) this time i am asking for different phone the phone works fine then all of sudden one day 1 2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you ca n't get to anything no phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing ! ! ! ! it is extremely frustrating what is the point of a cute phone that does n't work	7
0	well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it	7
0	i am terribly disappointed with my razr v3c phone i purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the only positive features the viewing screen is so small that i ca n't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size the battery dies about three hours after being charged even if i have n't used the phone it does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has verizon service i am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and i ca n't find any way change this i wish i had my old sprint phone again	7
0	holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break after that happens the phone falls out pretty easily \( and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working \) i ended up replacing it with a different holster from rim that has a magnetic clasp \( the replcement works great	7
0	i recived a blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case i tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did i tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic the reason i gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call i suggest you get a leather on they work alot better	7
0	i have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months it used to be only 6 each so it didnt matter too much \( nextel sells theirs for usually 15 20 \) this is a cheap knockoff but if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them feel free to buy this item now that they have raised the price to 10 i 'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at nextel	7
0	i have to return this order motorola not some off name brand it doen not fit the phone it says it fits	7
0	just as a note to any motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phone the wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove do not bother with it this item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another motorola phone but i have no way to find out as i only own an i530	7
0	i got this items for my palm tx it ncame in the same week that i order it that was great ! plug it in it did n't fit so wigle it in windup pushing the tip in i manage to pull the out the tip i tryed again this time i grip the base tightly the base split in two one more time this time the coper piece got smashed i straighten out the coper plug it in it work bearly i threw it away k p s not good purchaged do n't bu	7
0	i ordered a pc case that came in a box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but i ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars never agai	7
0	i purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone my old battery would not hold a charge anymore so i wanted a new one the new one proved to be just as bad i do n't think it 's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead would not recommend ordering this if you 're looking to replace an old one	7
0	i ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters i got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown the shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so i am not going to pay to send them back i never got an e mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e mail to the company i will not buy any thing else from them	7
0	the other reviewer could n't run much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc i wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so i thought great i ca n't get any power through mine at all the little light goes on but the radar detector does n't go and the cell phone charger does n't go i 'll probably take it apart andd see if i can rewire it it is n't worth shipping back i really ca n't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer	7
0	i have had three of these during my two year contract i am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years each has had the problem of powering down and re booting without warning the are billed as mil spec this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse get ready for many trips to the sprint store motorola used to be the name in communications but after this and my friend 's problems with the razr 's i'm headed to nokia	7
0	my office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract no person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance if everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you it will give you something to complain about for the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your nextel sprint network contract	7
0	stay away from this phone the 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired picking up my last i530 if this one goes im canceling my nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier i 've had it ! nextel and motorola ca n't figure out that this phone is junk	7
0	i bought this phone at the same time i bought the i870 i 've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it 's fine my husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards what army \? do not buy this phone ! \( unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months	7
0	i was seconds away from ordering this charger for my mother 's v170 thanks for the reviews you have saved me time money frustration for letting me know it wo n't work	7
0	i would have thought that amazon would have fix the problem that it did not fit v170 i ordered and guess what it did not fit i am returning it6 6 0	7
0	i bought my wife a brand new v170 for her birthday she wanted an extra charger to take to work so i bought this one big mistake ! it simply would not fit in the charger jack so basically it 's a worthless piece of plastic last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in the trash brand new box and all at 7 99 it was n't even worth the trouble to try to return it do n't make the same mistake i did	7
0	i saw the other review that said it did n't work for v173 but i bought this anyway for my v170 it also does n't work for v170 why amazon is advertising and selling this product as a motorola v170 charger is beyond me i guess sometimes the products are mislabeled	7
0	the jack does n't fit in the hole of the phone on the motorola v173 do n't know about v170	7
0	first the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen protecting them from wear fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket now cons dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone the plastic screen also attracts dust when i tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped all in all i would not have bought this product again please avoid	7
0	i wanted to give it only one star but maybe it 's a little better than the original but i ca n't really tell much difference it still goes down by the end of the day and i do n't like the bulge oh well it 's only 15 it was worth a chance	7
0	my equipment is a nokia 6225 i have 2 pc with windows 2000 professional \( sp4 \) and windows xp pro and both do n't works they do n't know the device and with the pc suite of nokia it is not connected either who can help me \? thanks	7
0	i assumed that i would get a dku 5 which is supposed to work according to the nokia site however i got a dku 2 which does indeed connect to my phone \( 6016i \) but is recognized by neither win xp nor linux i'm bummed the part number should have been properly displayed somewhere the packaging indicates that it is in fact nokia part	7
0	the cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone this cord is pure crap	7
0	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
0	the good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the treo 650 's interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that i wish i had never upgraded to the 680	7
0	i love the way the phone looks and feels but that 's about it from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i 've ever owned i 've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise	7
0	due the lower price of the charge i decide to buy it but it does n't work on my sony ericson w300i at all bad inversio	7
0	este producto no es lo que anuncian 100 metros de alcance y solo palabras no sirve no la debuelvo porque me sale mas caro el envio de lo que cuesta esta porqueri	7
0	the external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional false advertising	7
0	poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy buy something else that actually works	7
0	i encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle as soon as i got this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction the main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok \( not the 100 meters that it claims \) as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes	7
0	i am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up instead i cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug and play	7
0	the product works but the software that claims to be windows compatible say 's it is not when installing caused a lot of annoying delays when installing set system restore point before installing software has n't caused any problems yet	7
0	this is a terrible product it is too big for your blackberry they send it with another door for the backside because your current door wo n't fit over this huge battery ! ! it is frankly unbelievable that blackberry and amazon would foist this product on us the battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your blackberry holster do not buy this idiotic product	7
0	this device is unusable with a treo 600 every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card do n't waste your money	7
0	label states that it is for a 600 it doesnt fit a 650 as well as i thought i	7
0	very simple it is not fit the treo 650 look elsewhere for a case or clip	7
0	the krzr is a really cool looking phone but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery life \( 1 day \) and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and wait for it to come up i would explore other options	7
0	i returned this phone after one week currntly the motoral software has a glitch and you ca n't assign specifice ring tones to phone number ear piecs sound quality is marginal text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small the back panel display is too small and hard to read	7
0	i think that logitech make the best accessories i have the camera the fancy dinovo bluetooth keyoard so naturally this headset was a no brainer the reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public it worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the logitech bluetooh hub do n't you find that strange \? aside from that it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone \( ca n't remember the model \) in addition it really hurts my ears not the most comfortable so you decide if this product works for you	7
0	this headset has a major flaw the connections between the headset and phone are full of static the other parties do n't hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and i'm asking them to repeat themselves i 've compared it with a couple other headsets i 've got and they do n't have this problem in the same locations actually this headset has static problems anywhere office car out walking you name it do yourself a favor and avoid this one	7
0	i 've used the headset for a little over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance there was no notice when it disconnected recently the plastic ear clip broke and i contacted logitech and was informed that since it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headset a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies logitech 's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant	7
0	i 've had two of these both sounded and worked well for a few months then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second when this happens you 're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery while it 's perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste \( battery contains lithium i bet \) skip by this one if you 're smart i 've been had twice	7
0	the charger was not compatible with my blackjack terrible product not as advertised	7
0	i have never met anybody that has ear holes big enough for these ! i even tried superglue to put the things that fit inside the ear ! that didnt work so now i have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seat next to me i would not reccomend these to anybody truth hurts these hurt my ears	7
0	i do n't know about you folks but i have small ears though the sound on these ear buds are good i ca n't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they 're too big for me and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords good idea badly designed for size differences	7
0	this product stopped working after about a week or two lesson learned buy oem products instead of cheap knock off	7
0	amazon rebate is a scam i purchased this headset on 1 23 2007 and received it on 1 25 2007 however the rebateshq site was not functioning on 1 25 2007 when it works the next day it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture if you click on the url link supplied by amazon rebate form you will be able to find the offer by amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired' there is no way around what a scam it 's a shame for amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers it 's 5 99 come on	7
0	i bought this for my new samsung slider phone \( which i love \) but this case is to snug for it the slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out it 's a cute case i would love to use if it was just a little larger	7
0	it was really cute when i got it two days later the color started chipping away the stones started falling off as well i was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when i got it i do not recommend buying it	7
0	i bought this item at the end of january and received it in febuary it is now march and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry i bought this i am going to order another color and see if it does the same not very happy with this	7
0	door stop they have the m610 listed so i took a chance but it will not charge the phone so i'm out 10 00 \( 50 of the sprint price however sprint is out of stock right now	7
0	i am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for apple computers samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac the company i ordered the cable from is great easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac bummer i have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because i want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac i blame samsung	7
0	it did not fit my phone and i was forced to go out and but another one	7
0	i bought these adaptors to use regular head phones \( 3mm \) with my cell phone mp 3 \( lg cu500 \) player once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound you only can hear the music through one ear whoever started the whole 2 5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail it makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone i have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level they all have some type of flaw the volume wo n't get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc	7
0	i received 2 2 5mm to 3 5mm stereo headphone adapter one did n't work the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality if you push the headphone jack \( male \) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers and even then the quality is not good	7
0	i would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort the 2 5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active i tried both adapters \( i bought the 2 pack \) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose in positive news the connection at the 3 5 mm end is nicely snug	7
0	the adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500 the sound only came out of one ear when plugged in	7
0	the color of the product i received is nothing like the picture ! if you want royal blue then this is the case for you	7
0	i bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges doh ! this crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use i only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when i did no jostling or forcing the case the little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time do not buy this pos unless you want to throw your money out	7
0	i ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival also notice that this is not a samsung oem part if you call to ask for tech support from samsung they will tell you they ca n't help you the only positive thing i have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless	7
0	i go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it when i got it in the mail i found that the c d they burned and sent with it would not work you had to have the product license number which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy i was never able to get it too work my advvice to you is not to buy this product but if you want to chance it you may be lucky i wasnt	7
0	cool concept and everything but when i tried to install the driver my cd rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little cd	7
0	worked good for a few months then battery started draining fast now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead	7
0	bought this because logitech has a great reputation with other products i used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and i never found the battery life to be long enough i actually went back to a jabra wired unit until recently when i purchased a samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better i guess i prefer the in ear style	7
0	i have two of these head sets one never keeps its charge pretty much from the time i bought it the other seems to charge alright the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime the sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic also it 's big and heavy compared to the motorola i own i highly recomend the motorola \( sorry i dont know the model number off hand	7
0	good sound nd price nicely connect with mobile however not work at all with my pc neither mac once it 's connected with my moble they refuse to get in touch with any pc they do n't connect with 2 diveces in same time it 's ok but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile still it 's not changing no connection with my pc so i was expecting use this for my skype but no way real cheap gadget	7
0	the sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering i loved it when it was n't broken even wind did n't seem to bother the headset much the voice quality was great on transmission and reception but the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and ca n't be replaced i got a new headset the first time on warranty the second time it broke i could have gotten a free replacement again but i did n't want the hassle i have a scala now that i 've been using for months and i'm very happy with it even though the sound and wind immunity does n't measure up to the logitech	7
0	i cannot believe how poor this product was made the hell with this product noboday noooooooooboooooody buy thsi product talk about poor	7
0	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
0	in the ad this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my treo it will charge but i already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose falsely calims to sync	7
0	i 've purchased this car charger for my treo and theorder was delivered promptly unfortunately theconnector that was suppose to go into my treo 650 didnot fit \( too big \) so i was n't able to connect it andcharge the phone i send it back	7
0	this product was listed as being for my phone when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models it was misleading and it never worked even messed up my phone a little and i lost 5 00 in shipping because of the decpetion	7
0	this product really needs installation assistance too many options and i spent 2 hours trying to figure it out i'm going to call to get more info arrival time 5 starsprice 5 starsinstallation and ease 1 sta	7
0	i bought this product for my cell wich was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers i would not do business with this people again this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time amazon should not permit them take people 's money like that amazon suports those fakes	7
0	junk ! sent with a cd that had a usb driver but would n't work on two different computers contacted the shipper bargaincell but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed the email stated emphatically that they do n't provide support for the product	7
0	i bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer the description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does not ! ! the software needed to download the pictures is not correct when we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem apparently i am not the only person to have this problem with the product again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are not accurate it does not work	7
0	this product is the worst of its kind ! it lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matter how cheap i picked one up at walmart for ten bucks that works great do n't waste your time on this one it is cheap but do n't be had stay away from this product	7
0	i have had this phone for about six months i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it 's hard to do anything the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it 's closed it 's almost impossible to hear i almost never hear it ring i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on ! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon	7
0	the phone may be fine but i will never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked perhaps it was the phones fault i never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account overall their customer service is awful days of waiting and receiving no information i had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right i spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed now i have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service i plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone its garbage i went with the t mobile sidekick and already am way happier	7
0	this phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap its useless the software on it is very cheap and childish not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are too small for anyone who does n't have 10yr old hands just because it has a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash purchase a different phone this one is not worth it	7
0	bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline should n't a cell phone battery last longer than a month \? \? they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i 'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same	7
0	you have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract the wire is very thin so i'm thinking it will not last long	7
0	i ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails ! stay away not recommended	7
0	this case actually scratches and destroys your pearl the inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone the phone does n't provide any protection on top i really regret buying this my phone is all scratched get a soft case that stays on permanently pass this one up	7
0	when i first received the items they did n't work and them i returned and had to spend more money and they still do n't work i even had the computer specialist at work try and they could n't even get them to work i sent them a e mail to receive my money back because i did n't want to keep spending money to send items back that do n't work back who would have guessed but they never replied thanks for waisting my time and money i will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware	7
0	misleading pictures the holster is triangular not rectangular as the picture would suggest also it does not fit well with the razr phone i'm afraid the phone will fall off any second if i use it this one goes to the trash can	7
0	after hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work it eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again my opinion is to stick with the oem cable the extra money 's worth paying to avoid the headache	7
0	do not purchase this flexi skin what a waste of 20 bucks ! ! the skin hinders the camera 's functionality a very small portion of the flexi skin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos i had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures next it makes your otherwise super pimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a zach morris style nokia from 1993 additionally the flexi skin actually traps dust and other particles between the skin and the phone this item blows in both functionality and aesthetics do n't waste you money ! ! !	7
0	first time when i plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that charging error remove immediately since then i am not using this	7

0	says the usb data cable works on a vx8600 no driver was included and no drivers are available on line for this none of the drivers that came with the package worked either as for their return policy after a couple e mail exchanges they just sent me an address they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation i do n't want to wrap something up that i already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item time is money	7
0	i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it wrong item	7
0	it has a samsung logo but it looks fake after i bought it the belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason	7
0	this product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	7
0	i guess you get what you pay for so i was n't totally surprised that the battery did n't work what was worse is that when i sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a part of what i paid for it do n't do business with these guys and do n't buy this battery	7
0	i ca n't complain about shipping it was really fast but i get the thing i plug it in use it 1 time the 2nd time i plug it in the metal piece that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it making a freakin paper weight cheap piece of cra	7
0	i ordered before brent birckhead 's review came up and i got taken this is not a leather case for lg env vx 9900 the correct internal dimension is 4 x 1 3 4 x 0 5 clearly not a size that the vx9900 can fit into considering that the seller enters the product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake i think amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly	7
0	please read ! ! ! ! this cases does not fit the lg env dont bu	7
0	palm could not resolve all the issues associated with treo i bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently	7
0	i 've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with cingular i 've gone through 4 phones the same thing over and over never did they \( or i \) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the sd card \( although right now it 's working and the card is not in it go figure ! \) so i guess the options are not download things but have the phone work or download things onto my sd card and not have a phone	7
0	poor quality product the product is two rigid pieces of plastic a slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case madeit impossible to fit my chocolate phone you wo n't know if your case will fit until you try to put it on ! ! ! you 're taking a chance if you buy this produc	7
0	i have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price i thought my fulfilled contract \( i am on month to month now \) meant i could qualify for a new account and keep my number no such luck after wasting a few hours dealing with cingular and then someone in india on behalf of wirefly i had to return it it is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer ! i will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though i would prefer the 750	7
0	i ordered this phone on 3 28 07 it shipped via fedex on 3 29 07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3 2 07 the package sat on the fedex truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for this was after i 'd already called fedex to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving fedex 's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded for the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local cingular store	7
0	battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time	7

1	i owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart it was 30 at best buy i have n't replaced it as 30 is a lot 10 \? i'm buying two more i can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems it has far better sound quality than my 'backup' which is a jabra with no boom the ear volume is adjustable on my phone and i'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that wo n't let them adjust the volume	7
1	the sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others the bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first \( and my neice used the extra buds for her mp3 player and loved them \)	7
1	the device works fine and i do n't feel i over paid sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
1	the compatibility with nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in bold letters within the title it says quot universal 2 5mm jack quot universal meaning all 2 5mm jacks not all cell phones know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review great product	7
1	ive always stayed away from the flip slider phones because im good at breaking things ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong the mini sd port is awesome	7
1	i just picked up one of these for my motorola cell phone it has more than enough volume it comes with both a right and left ear adapter fits pretty good and i have medium sized ears its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it it is very comfortable though if you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset	7
1	if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing ! ! ! do n't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that \? \? ! ! ! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it ! ! ! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn t have a chord jeez !	7
1	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
1	these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they 're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying	7
1	i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i ca n't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and do n't fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them \( i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so do n't say you ca n't use all of the sizes guys	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
1	i recently got this phone and love it t mobile 's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself for all the people saying that it is n't really magenta it is the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades	7
1	i purchased the pink razr with cingular service and could n't be happier i have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all i am very happy with it t mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why i chose cingular	7

1	love it sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it 's still red which is nice i will probably get another color on it for spring the fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where i got my razr since the sprint red is a little different also maintains all openings for data cables etc	7
1	absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m fits perfectly	7
1	this protects my ppc 6700 wonderfully i 've dropped it many times and this case protected it like i wanted no scratches nothing having room for the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone	7
1	was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what i expected for the price i really thought it was a little cheap looking in person as it was a gift i was somewhat disappointed in the quality however the person i gave it to was pleased	7
1	this headseat is pretty neat when you 're on the road or just relaxing between work it easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause play and answer hangup features the comfort of the ear budds could be a little better but the stereo sound is great	7
1	fast service good price look forward to future business dealings	7
1	this is a great product the only area of improvement would be the belt clip it is very difficult to attach to the belt over all it is a great case	7
1	i really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent	7
1	this is really cool phone and has many features unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the u s one thing i do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the us and retailers charge much more price its price is just 429 99 on the nokia 's web page the phone gets 5 stars but the retailer 's price gets 2 stars	7
1	i will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone i have ever owned its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear	7
1	i was completely satisfied with the phone clip i purchased it`s sturdy and well constructed i would recommend it i will use this site again	7
1	i have had this motorola v171 for a year now and i absolutely love it the features are so easy to understand the customer service reps for net 10 wireless are very hard to understand this phone is a net 10 wireless phone net 10 wireless is a subsidiary of tracfone i would this phone to anybody looking for a prepaid cell phone plan i love it because only for a limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation of your phone i would also strongly recommend that if anybody purchases this motorola activate it on its a whole lot easier than calling	7
1	i 've been using this phone with the net10 service since march and have to say i am very happy with it coverage areas have been great i do n't use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go although the phone does n't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have it gets the job done	7
1	i have not had any problems with this phone i dont use it for long periods at a time only in the car and for text adding minutes is easy and i really get my moneys worth with the rollover i averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare so its great for me i got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper overall i would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week	7
1	i like this little flip phone the service has been good and the features are easy to use the only reason i give 4 stars is because i am not sure how long the phone will last the flip part is a little weak but we will have to see it was really easy to add minutes and you can do it right from your net10 phone	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	after buying the new lg chocolate i found that i needed to buy a new car charger for it i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value so far it 's worked just like it should	7
1	when i first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as i opened the package and put my phone in it i could tell it was a perfect fit i really like the clear window which i did not have on my previous case now i can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time	7
1	this is the best bluetooth i have used wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for cardo is great i have 5 co worker who has order the headset just a great product great pric	7
1	my only complaint and consequently the 4 star rating is that sometimes i do n't hear the blackberry or feel the vibration apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the oem plastic holster	7
1	this is a great way to carry the blackberry it also keeps it protected i would recommend this product	7
1	provides great protection for the treo but does add a noticeable amount of thickness making it more of a bundle	7
1	overall i like it the best part is the flip up screen protector i have had 2 zire models and managed to break both screens my dislike is that i have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting i have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail as for the sd card issue i remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject to keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo i drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes	7
1	the skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off	7
1	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a treo 650 so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the treo 650 skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a treo 650 i also see they have these for the blackberries	7
1	iam very pleased with this item i purchased it for my son	7
1	i made the mistake of ordering a 7 00 battery and i thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting i replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ so word to the wise just get this battery and you will not have my problems well worth it	7
1	this item works perfectly with my samsung blackjack the sound quality is exceptional the only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off	7
1	when i bought my motorola v220 my cingular store charged top dollar for the car charger and they were sold out i was thrilled when i found this starter set on amazon the car charger is compatible with the v220 and it comes with case and hands free ear bud all for less than i would have paid for the charger alone the ear bud does not have the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate i would n't buy this set specifically for those items although they both work with fit the v220 as i see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger five stars for the charger three for the rest	7
1	this item was easy to find purchase and use saved us several dollars as well a true win win thanks	7
1	the product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy the hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after i did a hard reset of my palm tx so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my tx for some reason the cable wo n't let me charge using the usb wall charger i got for my wife 's ipod but it does charge the tx off my computer 's usb port \( which is a powerbook g4 notorious for being underpowered \)	7
1	i have trouble to buy from bestbuy but i ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product ! thanks	7
1	the item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it was n't hit or treated carelessly i 'll order some more because they are really cheap and it 's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days i had to dump it	7
1	got this to protect my motorola l6 phone it fits the phone like a glove i also love that it protects the phone screen the only complaint is that the case open easily if it 's dropped or handled in a rough way clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that my toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it the case still does not have a chip or crack on it	7
1	a perfect fit for my l6 i love the protection for the screen it covers all of it so you do n't need those plastic screen covers do n't be afraid if you drop your phone because it 's protected	7
1	i have been buying these chargers from sprint and they last about six twelve months i bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angle to the power adapter i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from sprint my wife carries her 's in her purse while i just keep mine in my car this is the best car charger for the treo and i have had treo 's for about 6 years	7
1	fits the cell phone well and seems secure i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow	7
1	i recommend this phone to anybody i absolutely love it i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far the music player is great and i swear the camera looks alot better than 1 3 mega pixel the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it if you buy this phone it will last you a long time but yeah so far no problems whatsoever i love it	7
1	i got a chance to play with one of these last week the external speaker is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1gb card my only gripe is the slide feels a little loose i felt like i was always going to open it up by mistake all in all a killer phone and the mp3 capability software is a lot better than my krzr	7
1	i'm quite happy with this car charger it 's much faster than the old one i used for an earlier ericsson cf388 quite simply it does what is supposed to	7
1	good product the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free works well	7
1	i 've owned and discarded numerous chargers this one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use it looks pretty fragile but so far it 's held up to pretty heavy use many of the other chargers i 've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one	7
1	easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others protects well and does not hinder any functions	7
1	do n't go without an extra cell phone battery this is the one you want if you do n't like the bulky one	7
1	this product needs a better custom fit it slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big	7
1	i have a baby pink razr and this skin looks so good over it also it really adds grip so it 's not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr i would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr they are awesome	7
1	this cover is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped it is n't soft leather so if you want to protect your razr you might want to consider a shield	7
1	i think it will do a good job of protecting my phone in case i drop it	7
1	this razr phone cover is a great product hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable easy access to side buttons protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover i 've seen for this phone keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them overall a good product for the money	7
1	the cord appeared to be pretty messy but the product is just fine good quality sound accept hang calls volume control i do n't think i want more the connector is a pop port connector it 's showed just as big in the product 's image if you have a 2 5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image then what the h is wrong with you \?	7
1	this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky come with belt clip if u need i	7
1	great product exactly as advertised thinking about buying a couple more in different color	7
1	i am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinion	7
1	wow i have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever clear sound great range and most of all its gorgeous turns heads all over the place man i feel high tech with this thing on i payed 30 00 off of ebay but that was a rare deal still amazons price cannot be beat buy it youll love it	7
1	got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday easy to configure and use nice sound quality only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly	7
1	this is a great product it actually fits into my ear properly and i can hear clearly through it it is easy to operate and the charge last for many days i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size	7
1	crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phone accessory to have ! love it ! ! amazon 's price could n't be beat very happy with it !	7
1	comfortable easy to put on fair to good sound quality full charge lasts approximately 2 3 weeks fully compatible with blackberry pearl and motorola razr nice style with black and alloy accents some callers claim to hear echoing not the best sound quality \( i like logitech better	7
1	i had a motorola h300 before and this is leaps and bounds better the sound quality in both units are great but i'm impressed by the weight of this lg unit it is like comparing stones to feathers \( a bit exagerated but you get the point \) this lg unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear the motorola unit did n't which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls that caused discomfort and i had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear with the new lg i no longer have to look like i have a stiff neck while i'm driving	7
1	this item came with the other item i ordered at the same time it 's quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as i would have liked	7
1	the title says it all fits great great price ! real leather and fits like a glove	7
1	this product is a good deal if you know how to use it unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider the verizon v cast product would be better because it comes with headphones if you already have the headphones \( which cost anywhere from 20 100 \) than this product will be good for you	7
1	it fits great but does n't cover the corners of the phone kinda the point of a case the seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful the bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you 're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket	7
1	i am using this as a spare so have n't actually put it in the phone yet i will definately take it on vacation with me	7
1	use it every day it 's a nice connector that does just what it says it does as with all treo palm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection wiggling the connector where it meets the treo is usually enough for it to work for me	7
1	this is the correct cable for the tungsten e2 it 's not listed in the product description but you can find the info on zip linq 's web site i 've had several of these for other devices great products	7
1	the product works very well but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone overall i would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting great buy for the price	7
1	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
1	this is the best phone i have ever had reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera and best of all very very user friendly	7
1	i was expecting just to save the touch screen from scratches but these screens make the touch screen also feel better there was no loss of brightness with the screen placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough its a pack of 15 screens have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all i 'll need to replace it	7
1	this holster holds the v220 securely in place the only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone	7
1	i really like my lg vx4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now i 've used it for 3 years and really like it 's basic functionality the battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that 's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low battery life i'm hoping it 'll last for 2 more years before i get a new phone to catch up with the modern world	7
1	saves time and up downloading pics tunes to from my phone	7
1	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a blackberry so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the blackberry skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a blackberry i also see they have these for the treos	7
1	this cover is so hot i get tons of complements on it it's a great color and the screen protector helps a lot too i would deffinetley recomend this to any one	7
1	this case is superior it attaches easily and i especially like the screen cover most cases do n't have this \( if you drop the phone and crack the screen you 're hosed \) the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip it 's bulky and impractical just a simple tension clip would have been fine	7
1	i have had this phone for almost 2 years now i have dropped it many times still works in dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants i let it dry out for 1 day and guess what it works i am still using it as it works perfectly even the camera i used my sisters razr phone this weekend and i hated it the redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable i will be keeping my samsung for as long as it lives	7
1	if you 're hard on your electronics \( like i am \) this phone is for you it 's practically indestructible i put mine through the washing cycle \( as in washing machine yes \) three times let it dry overnight and it still works perfectly i 've also run it through the dryer twice dropped it countless times thrown it at a wall and ran over it on a mountain bike the camera still works and i think the reception actually got better after going through the washer all it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna this is a perfect phone for a on the go klutzy person	7
1	this phone is great ! ! ! i love this phone i have had no problems with this phone at all the camera is pretty good and it 's small and cute in size and it has good reception i would definitely reccomend this phone ! !	7
1	this similar unit is 1 4th the cost of the official phone belt clip that verizon sells for the lg vx 8300 and it is just as good verizon sells it for 19 99 taxamazon vendor sells it for 01 4 99 shippingbottom line it is just a piece of plastic that gets the job don	7
1	my daugher loves this one	7
1	i 've had my snap on case for about a month and i love it the magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone the bottom case could fit a little more snugly but it 's not a problem	7
1	fits great my wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone	7
1	we got this phone for my sister 's new razor the color and fit were great ! i was worried since it was a phone from altell but it fit like a glove ! thanks	7
1	if you have a cell phone you need a charger you do n't have to get a car charger but it 's a good idea if you have a car this works well	7
1	this is a very nice case it fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it i found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit a great case that i would highly recommend	7
1	no comment everything is ok ! regards cristia	7
1	it snapped right on and looks great but sometimes it can slip and press the buttons on the side of your phone it can either make the phone not work or run down the battery	7
1	first of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product it is ! i absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it ! thanks	7
1	quality of this product was excellent i have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover would recomment this to anyone i have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it only one complaint the clip is not tight enough on my belt would recommend a little tighter overall the best i have ever seen the stitches are even and tight good quality	7
1	this case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt at worl plays movies etc easily access good looking ! it functions at any level shop at amazon for all your motorola needs !	7
1	this was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery the only thing i do n't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around all in all this was a great deal	7
1	the battery works great and lasts a long time i 'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes	7
1	i like the shape of the plug so that it does n't cover up any other outlets it works what else can i say	7
1	this is a great basic cell phone i bought one and received another as a gift unfortunately i opened both so now i have \( 2 \) if anyone needs one for twenty five plus shipping that has not been registered with net10 \( still has bonus 300 minutes and no number \) is new and has all original accessories \( open package \) or for ten extra you can get an oem car charger leather case and earphone \( all unused \) please email movieshop \( at \) hotmail \( dot \) com	7
1	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7

1	i have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great i mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good i have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces this phone i dont have that problem it is really made good i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine	7
1	after two no brand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and nokia phone suite this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly \( note nokia phone suite must be separately downloaded but is free of charge \) we have uploaded photographs from our nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable i recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone some motorola phones accept a universal mini usb cable which i believe is cheaper	7
1	the pack is quite as described any one of the three itemsmight justify the small expense	7
1	good purchase although i have not used the headset yet the case and charger work perfectly great savings amazon is the place to shop for a discount	7
1	be careful amazon identifies this phone as being gsm 850mhz it is not read the 'vital statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850mhz check the sony web page \( and other people who sell this phone \) and you will see that it does not work on 850mhz i do n't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when i discovered this discrepancy i gave it 4 stars because of the cool magic mirror case i have no idea if this phone is really good or not	7
1	i love this phone i can do so much with it it is light weight and fun to carry i love the button flip feature great phone ! !	7
1	purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems many nice features and the service in the state of ga is good	7
1	very well thought design i just wished i looked up at the pictures on here again before i pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first i thought it was weird but after i looked at the pictures again man how brilliant ! they should 've provided some sort of user guide on how to put the case on and the leather is of a very high quality too the seller is awesome very amazon like shipping \( i e fast \)	7
1	i was very happy to see that amazon shipped me palmone brand stylus 's and not some generic this is a great deal and i'm going to order some more thank	7
1	does what it needs to the hell with palm that changes stylus with every new model	7
1	this battery arrived fast fits and works well i highly recommend this seller	7
1	great battery now the phone goes way longer without needing to be recharged	7
1	i ordered this headset in silver webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really is silver ! we argued about the color and i finally convinced them that samsung makes white silver red and black it took almost a month to get resolved but i finally have the silver headset that i ordered it is very small light and easy to use there are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit the headset gets 4 stars webtreo only gets 1 star i would n't order any products from them again	7
1	this is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market it is small and very light as well just like wearing an earing the sound is amazingly clear people on the other end thought i was actually using my phone i have no problem with it falling off just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear i'm so happy with this cutie that i'm buying it for my sisters friends	7
1	excellent sound quality noise cancellation really works the button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call very nice works much better and more reliably than any bluetooth set i 've tried and i 've tried almost all of them	7
1	only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil	7
1	i purchase this phone for my daughter for xmas and it was exactly what she wanted i also was very please with it	7
1	this case has good quality construction and fits properly it solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case two things kept me from rating it 5 stars i prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses i also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which i find less cumbersome while working the fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning this is still the best optional case if you want to use the mp3 player feature and require the use of earphones	7
1	i recently took a chance on this item and i am happy to report that its not bad ! i was actually not looking forward to a swivel \( bad experience \) but the swivel is very solid it looks good the skin is not the best but i like it the only problem i have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use it	7
1	works great with my sch a950 and bitpim	7
1	it 's not rocket science it works or it does n't the device works fine my only complaint is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price the short cord is the only reason it did n't get a 5 star rating it 's well worth the money	7
1	you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it	7
1	i have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product it works and looks great i only wish they could make a pda phone that was n't as big as a boat	7
1	the battery works very well however the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily	7
1	the holster that samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster how stupid is that \? why would samsung supply this type of holster to their customers \? however this holster has solved that problem you can now flip open your phone when using this holster thank yo	7
1	i was n't expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but i'm very impressed i bought from accessory one the total cost was about 4 the case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case others have complained of chipping paint but in the week i 've been using this it has n't chipped yet ca n't do any better for the	7
1	very nice but i do n't like the belt clip if i remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be	7
1	for the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain it fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip i found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem i would recommend this product highly	7
1	the battery was everything needed no surprises it fit the phone and charged fine	7
1	i received exactly what i ordered very quickly	7
1	thought i 'd post this info here since this subject still confuses people i just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180 day period will invalidate 250 amazon phone rebate well i guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since i do n't really need a data plan and planned to use wifi connectivity most of the time any comments \? i still would like to give it 5 stars since i believe it is a great product i 'll take one star off however due for its weak battery life and lack of standard audio connection \( 2 5 or 3 5 minijack \)	7
1	i bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmasi upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the gps servicei love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used tooverall this was the best purchase for the price i ended up spending almost 900but i also had the bluetooth essential pack the gps and some other featuresthis is the best phone out period no the iphone is n't going to beat itthe iphone does n't have a slide out keyboardthat 's soemthing i do n't want to part withi would like to see the iphones operating system though ! but the 8525 takes home the trophy ! ! !	7
1	battery came quickly and performs as describe	7
1	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7
1	i 've had my tracfone for about 5 months now the reception has been generally good once i got the phone activated i have n't had any problems tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes all you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral my email is debsclay gmail comthank you	7
1	very good phone nice color screen easy to read lots of features	7
1	my experience using the tracfone has been good coverage and connections are not a problem	7
1	extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things this is one better as it has a pen built in just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you 've got a pen you never know when you 'll need one so when you do there it is it also blends in well with the design of my treo 700wx both visually and tactile ly good stuff	7
1	the product came promptly and i am happy with the quality however fitment was n't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo not a huge problem but something i would feel everytime i reach for the stylus but the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands i would definately recomment this product to others	7
1	this is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the v188	7
1	roi is great working very nice for me been using this for the past 2 months fried my original one when used it abroad with wrong voltage	7
1	excellent price for the charger original motorola equipment shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item shipping was very fast i definetly will continue to do business with amazon and a1 accessories very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience	7
1	kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector does what it is supposed to do	7
1	the price is good and the cable is working well i had a very good experience with this cable	7
1	i recently bought a nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones however the nokia ca 53 cable was around 50 dollars this was a great alternative so far everything that i have used it for is working flawlessly i would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the ca 53	7
1	this product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone i love it to death and use it almost everyday eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and i completely want more bussiness with them	7
1	works fine difficult to connect but connects securely comes with an unlabeled cd \( could n't tell one side from the other \) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones are n't labeled in any helpful way i was impressed it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy	7
1	i bought this case for my lg chocolate and it is perfect the belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare the pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts the front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets the bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the chocolate 's end button this allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case the only dislike i have is the name cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal i would recommend this case to anyone who owns a chocolate	7
1	i 've had this case for under a month but it 's working great when i first got the case i thought i was going to have to send it back because i thought it was too small for my phone \( i have an lg cu500 from cingular \) it was a pretty tight fit but it worked the case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out	7
1	the computer recognizes my phone when i plug it in but the drivers on the provided cd are pretty much worthless	7
1	i needed a razr car charger and the crystal clear hard shell case was included with the purchase i did not think i would even use it but i love it ! it is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my razr phone !	7
1	cheap simple good looking the only thing missing is a belt clip there are stick on belt clips that work fine with this	7
1	prompt deliveryexcellent qualitya nice bonus hard shell case ! that does n't ruin razr 's stylish look a single bit	7
1	products exceeded my expectations the charger was n't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable i was n't interested in the case but after i got it i found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal	7
1	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
1	this is the best phone i have ever had reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera and best of all very very user friendly	7
1	i think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800 00 dollars well i called nokiausa direct and regular retail from them is 499 00all day as many as you want so it should be considerably less on amazon you would think \? i guess not !	7
1	i recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network i have so many acessories for this phone i did n't want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one i had thanks	7
1	my v180 is through cingular i never have a dropped call and reception is excellent long battery life very easy menus wayfinding and small size no frills like mp3 player or camera however just a very good phone	7
1	i 've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems it is good for making calls which is really all i ask for from a phone it is easy enough to use that i even bought one for my elderly parents and they 've had no problems my carrier is cingular and i 've had excellent service in the ny tri state area and because it is a quad band phone i 've also been able to use it while roaming internationally battery life is just okay \( not as good as my old nokia \) i have to recharge every other day with normal use overall it 's lasted me long enough that i would call it a good value	7
1	if you 're the type of person that does n't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i would n't pay over 40 bucks for it it 's a nice basic phone the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones	7
1	i must admit i was skeptical about this package it did n't seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price even though shipping was steep it was still worth the money the case fits great and it has n't cracked at all both chargers work great ! i think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but i ca n't complain ! i would highly recommend this package the chargers are n't high quality but they work	7
1	incredible price for all three items just for the car charger alone verizon wanted 24 00 the plastic cover for the phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily	7
1	this 3 piece combo is a good purchase the chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality for the price you can not beat it	7
1	helps reduce clutter and now i can actually close my cup holder tray \( acura rdx \)	7
1	this charger is awesome it is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it does n't get in the way like the spiral cords do the cord is thin not bulky i never measured the cord when extended but it is much longer than most	7
1	this car charger is amazing for the price you go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better the retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprint stores	7
1	i 've had it for about 2 months and i am still happy with it it has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but i like it	7
1	as advertised on time i 've used for two months and it works great i 'd buy from this outfit again	7
1	i like the way it does n't take up space in the console when i am not using it and it seems to charge the l6 just fine ! no complaints with the devise or the service from amazon	7
1	i'm happy i receive my cable it fast service i 'll still keep buying from this seller thank	7
1	ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it it is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone	7
1	car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter the design is basic with no hidden features you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device otherwise a perfect gift !	7
1	excellent qaulity for price divers easy to loa	7
1	this product has worked great the cord is a little short but have had no functionality issues	7
1	this was an excellant purchase it was exactly what i needed and works as well as one that would have cost me 20 or more in the stores	7
1	not much to say about a battery i installed it it works fine	7
1	i purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of service so it was time it does last longer and im glad i bought this battery i have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacement this is the one but you decid	7
1	this battery performs as expected it is the standard palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device note also that when using bluetooth and or the blackberry rim email service battery life is notably reduced the solution would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment so my solution was to have a second spare battery	7
1	this product far exceeded my expectations it installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day it has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced this navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with	7
1	this is a wonderful cover for your blackberry very sturdy and easy to use love it !	7
1	i did a lot of looking before purchassing a krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch it was a great investment the krusell case holds the blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing ! the pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards ! this is an excellent product	7
1	i used to forget my wallet but i always had my blackberry so i bought this then since i take my phone every where but not my wallet this salved the problem this is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other	7
1	i love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one it is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing i highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff	7
1	this charger works perfectly with my samsung blackjack it is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone	7
1	this is a great little desktop charger pocket for the motorala v60 and an additional battery however it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the fact that what the text does n't tell you is that you need an additional \( expensive \? \) serial cable adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges	7
1	i could n't believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already now i have to think about buying another one anyways it 's a cool headset i would recommand it to anyone who 's thinking about buying one	7
1	when i lost my stylus i had a difficult time finding a replacement the others i tried were n't the same these are	7
1	product is great for products such as samsung cell phone models a630 a850 a950 a970 a930 a990 a645 and a870 the thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office	7
1	i originally bought another motorola charger from a verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one i returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better ! it actually fully charges my phone in less time and i can swear my battery life lasts even longer it 's a great product for a great price ! delivery was quick too	7
1	this product is great it fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases	7
1	picture quality sucks for the price colors are way freaky the screen is perfect for text but not for pictures viewing pictures on this is terrible keyboard is ackward at first the manual needs to be much more detailed sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots i expected to use it like a typical pilot where you write on the screen this feature is not implemented overall this is a very good phone good reception great sound quality ! ! speakerphone is great ! neat features worth the	7
1	the treo600 has all the functions i needed phone calendar camera etc two shortcomings 1 \) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that 's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo6502 \) the phone failed to dial two times in two months i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem	7
1	it 's a very nice phone ! ! ! ! ! !	7
1	this is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen i do n't foresee it peeling ever it has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on i 've washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place it is extremely sensitive to bending and if you bend it it will never go back so be extra careful	7
1	durable thick does n't interfere in any way with the touch screen i have n't had to wash it yet so i have n't tried out that feature but i highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it 's been totally worth it to me \( hey after spending hundreds on your treo what 's a few dollars \? \)	7
1	i have a vx9900 env and this cable works great with it in conjunction with bitpim not much to say about it really it does what it should	7
1	got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything ! awesome deal for 3 bucks	7
1	works well driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install no synchronization software is included so you have to use a third party tool like bitpim which is ok	7
1	i ordered this cable on december 1st got it on the 8th very quick brand new it came with drivers but i did n't need it because i found drivers online the cable fit perfectly with my lgvx9900 and to my surprise it charges too i use it to put ringtones on it for free	7
1	great device pictures are amazing for a phone ! mp3 player could use a little help screen is beautiful and as always menu interface is a treat the phone is java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will not notify be able to notify you unless the program is open i e mig33 very other than the mp3 player and java notification issues the phone is a 5	7
1	this is a great phone pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier bit pricey but worth it great camera and interface super easy to upload pictures straight to flickr via phone this is a top selling handset in europe but tricky to get hold of in the us which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology	7
1	es el mejro celular q pude encontrar tar pasar 2 meses leyendo reviews en mil paginas 3 mp un screen de colores hermosos radio videos movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidos es el mejor celular del mercad	7
1	i paid 1 4 as much for this product and it works just as well as the name brand product	7
1	the product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly	7
1	the photo of this premiun side case is not at the photo the side case in the photo have a treo logo and the producto do n't have i	7
1	i tried one of the seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when i got in and out of my car the clip just would n't grip my belt securely enough i gave up after the 3rd time my treo 650 hit the concrete most of the time i just slip the thing in my left pocket but that does n't work so well with some pants especially jeans i decided to try the treo leather case and i like it quite a bit the clip is strong and i find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case	7
1	this case is great for protecting my treo but the downside is that i have to remove it from the case to use it i purchased it because i had actually dropped my treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now i clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and i do n't run the risk of leaving it behind	7
1	it is great ! you have to buy it believe me do n't waste your time looking for another case this is the best	7
1	how come phone accessories do n't qualify for prime shipping \? how are they different from other electronics	7
1	this case does what it is supposed to do it protects your palm treo phone it is very nice looking and durable the only negative comment that i will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit that is why i gave it a 4 5 amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price	7
1	fits nicely onto the kensington power block the fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	driver install was easy and bitpim access works just fine the cable i received also charges the phone \( vx8300 from verizon \)	7
1	i agree with previous reviewers \( gely zencity \) regarding this cable the price was right set up was easy and \( with the bitpim program \) you can communicate with your lg vx8300 efficiently i loaded my whole outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones do n't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from verizon 's sites \( vcast and such \) just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music tones that you already own	7
1	this is not an all in one package this is just the cable and driver you will likely need some type of additional software to actually do anything with the phone check out a freeware program bitpim for that i have a vx8300 the cable works the driver works bitpim works	7
1	it worked well with my vx8300 however i already had a driver that i knew worked so i did not use the disc so i cannot comment on the driver disc	7
1	product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do	7
1	i just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice it feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special i like the blue led light instead of the typical red dot also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging the ic chip is important so that you do n't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it 's life i would buy again great price for a quality charger	7
1	the only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if you 're using the extended battery for your a920 phone an e mail to krusell confirmed this other than that it 's a very nice and stylish case for the samsung a920 phone	7
1	top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily	7
1	i have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connect to a windows xp home system the shippment came extremely quick installation was seemless and the drivers from xp worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately downloaded the nokie suite software from the nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable use this one you will save money and its the same cable	7
1	i purchased the cable for my nokia 6255i the cable came faster than expected \( i find amazon fulfillment of orders very slow \) the cable came with the software driver \( although i did not need it \) and worked great with my already installed nokia sync software electro island had the best price by far and the service was excellent i would definitely use them again	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7

1	bluetooth cannot be accessed when the phone is in the pouch phone cannot not be charged while in the pouch	7
1	i was so easy and fast to order and the person i bought it from seemed to make it easier i have had no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchase i would definitly buy again	7
1	this cable saves me a lot of money i do n't need to buy stuff online when now i can download it straight to my pc makes it easy to transfer pictures videos ring tones contact numbers it is great to put things on and off also great for keeping a back up	7
1	my original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone i was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if you get the name brand this one i purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money	7
1	i have a sony ericsson z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger i got with the phone while it does charge i am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98 i am unsure however if this is because my battery is less effective than when new but all said it serves its purpose	7
1	this holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone it has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt it is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster the thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy in out the phone clips in solidly and does n't fall out	7
1	this item cost 1 penny \( of course the shipping was 4 84 \) but i thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores i 've had it for two weeks and it has n't broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally ca n't go wrong with the price order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters	7
1	this belt clip was exactly what i was looking for and the price was great	7
1	product functions well and looks good if i could change one thing the swivel action is just a little looser than i would like but definatly not a problem	7
1	yes it 's a tie with the sony cybershot k790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market \( at least until the iphone will show up then the game is on again \) i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and get this phone for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract	7
1	i highly recommend this bundle for the price for less than the cost of an offical verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a usb cable with driver cd everything works just fine the instructions for the usb cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use windows media player to move music over to your phone using the sync feature and you can use a free program such as bitpim to do other file transfers between your pc and phone	7
1	some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to work however i found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone after installing the drivers just search the web for a program called bitpim it 's not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done	7
1	i got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what i would have paid for the car charger alone you ca n't beat this price	7
1	dear alli have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one it has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed an ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times mp3 player is so gud but had to purchase an addition mem card i recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by t mobile which makes it trust at ruining times thanks for tmobile and amazon hope this help	7
1	if you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the v360 is an excellent choice it has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that i do n't want it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use	7
1	as usual motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all it 's more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal	7
1	this is a good solid phone so far other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual my biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory despite having something like five meg of memory on the phone and a micro sd memory card that 's it the size of the text message does n't seem to matter	7
1	i purchased this for 24 99 and that was a steal ! pros clear voice clarity nice signalseasy set up and sync with the phoneruns on nimh batteries cons not a good range if the cell is in my back pocket jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up	7
1	i bought this headset for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business i find it comfortable to wear and easy to use the sound quality is good volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo i like the fact that it uses an aaa battery instead of a charger all you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies \( even rechargeables do not last forever \) the ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear it would be nice if it bent for a custom fit but i am pretty happy with it	7
1	i purchased this headset \( \) and the key features i like are as follows 1 aaa battery no charging ! 2 easy to pair with my phone \( motorola slvr l7 european version \) 3 no static on both ends 4 have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated 5 price affordable but acts like an expensive headset 6 volume is good 7 fits well does not feel lose 8 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced i am very happy with it i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset	7
1	i will only use krusell products as they are better than best customer service is as good as the product there is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price the rating should be a 10	7
1	this charger is an excellent value it works beautifully with my treo 700p smartphone i love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to store the only complaint i 've heard is that the large blue power light is too bright at night it does n't annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blue glow does n't shine up into her eyes no problem	7
1	very nice product the retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone my complaint with all palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break but the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2	7
1	i have tried them all these are the best no more tangled cords i only look for cellet when i need a charger i have delt with cell phones for over 10yrs why pay 26 for a tangled mess	7
1	this is an excellent product in that it protects my treo 650 without hiding its style i chose treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from palm did n't work for me because i use the phone a lot and i dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime so it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it i also bought a body glove case and while i can use the phone while in it it hides the treo 's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag this one seems to even enhance the treo 's style	7
1	i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands ! ! anyone who are crazy over that color !	7
1	excellent people to work with had a return and they replaced it no questions asked	7
1	good battery life \( certainly much better than the old one it replaced \) for the most part it is indistinguishable from the original however it does n't fit quite as snugly in the dock style charger that came with my phone \( not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly \) that is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if i'm not paying attention i 'll wake up the next morning and my phone wo n't actually have been charged but it still works	7
1	this battery saved me from renewing the contract thus the battery was a contract killer i thought i was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49 99 at the verizon dealer but you guys saved the da	7
1	the product is probably a decent product but it does n't work in my vehicle '04 jetta i think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long	7
1	item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving	7
1	i received this very quickly i could n't believe i could get the actual namebrand at such a great price very pleased	7
1	once again thanks to amazon for this great product at great price moreover very reliable	7
1	it worked great just like i excpected everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase	7
1	the cable is exactly what i needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives drivers provided on the accompanying cd worked but were not as complete as i would have liked i am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that i was really after especially for the price at which i bought it	7
1	the vehicle phone charger i received was not the one pictured as for sale it does however appear to be equal in features i trust it will function as described i have now used this product and find that it does not work to charge my v170 cell phone the car 's power outlet does work i have since purchased the motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly i should have done this in the first place	7
1	this car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right	7
1	you might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by oem products gives one much peace of mind i am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if i know what i am getting is not just a counterfeit i think i got my money 's worth	7
1	after reading reviews here user forum 's i decided to purchase thisdesktop charging station it can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment and can chargethe extended life batteries as well while the q is on the charger the three color led indicator is added benefit w a simple guidethat is located underneath the unit the charger can not over charge the battery which is an added benefit and you can easily access the q while on the charger for sms texts using any app or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger	7
1	motorola should include this with each motorola q phone as standard equipment this should not be an add on	7
1	great product works quickly when charging my moto v555 in the car highly recommend it	7
1	i simply wanted a data cable to connect my verizon cell phone to my macintosh so i could transfer and synchronize data verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on windows machines this thrifty cable \( lt 10 \) worked perfectly with the mac friendly datapilot software	7
1	this was a whole lot cheaper than the verizon dealer wanted for this product my only disappointment was that it did n't have clear instructions which was lg 's fault	7
1	cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around 17 i would recommend this case	7
1	i just bought this case a few weeks ago and it 's holding up very well it has n't broken or scratched yet plus it makes my phone looks a lot better well i hope this thing will last for many months down the tough road ciao	7
1	i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from \? wich colors are there \? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee please answere asap	7
1	the case looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk	7
1	this was delivered as an oem product exactly as expected it came on time and was very reasonably priced i will do business with webtreo again	7
1	very good clip type phone holder came as advertised and quickly	7
1	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
1	i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life i had to charge my old battery everyday i only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days	7
1	this product is great i'm glad it came with the cloth too	7
1	i have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble this makes its way through all that problems well on the other hand it does have a catch1 finger print magnet2 the price that price for one ! ! ! and yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable	7
1	the touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice the onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen \( easier sad than done \) if anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	7
1	but it does have some faults i have had it for some time now i got it for my 11th birthday i have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon faults very short battery life i have to charge it almost every day ! camera the picture you take ca n't move or it comes out all messed up good parts big screen easy to read ! recording videos even though you get 15 seconds i still use that to make funny videos with my friends it 's style i love the color and style ! my friends are all jealous overall i think it 's a great phone	7
1	i just got my pink razr phone and i love it so far i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it still it works well i was scared to buy this phone because i read some of the reviews and some of them were n't saying good things about the phone but i think that they were wrong about it great job motorola keep up the good work	7
1	much longer lasting than the standard battery fast shipping	7
1	when i first got my motorola q i was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day with some setting changes and the 1700 mah battery that is now far in the past for the price it is an excellent deal ji	7
1	a little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my q holder but the extra power makes a big difference	7
1	this item is very excellent i was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions this shield fits very nicely over my phone screen	7
1	my friend from hk just got this phone and ask me to buy her an eforcity screen protector she loves it ! !	7
1	younger brother just got the verizon chocolate he 's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but i digress the screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator the film has some kind of electrostatic polymer there 's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed i would recommend	7
1	i like this case very much for my blackberry it definitely improves the grip on the blackberry especially when i'm using it as a phone it also serves as an excellent protector when i throw it in my purse my two problems are that i wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the speck ipod protective cases \( come on guys ! women use these items too ! \) also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the blackberry in the week that i 've had this case other than those two things this is a great not bulky case	7
1	it is small and compact easy for travel but also good for home use	7
1	i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed	7
1	i use my belt holster with all the phones i 've owned my i530 is noexception this belt holster feels really well made it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard i use it a big plus is that i can use my phone while it 's in the holster	7
1	works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan	7
1	i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it	7
1	what can i say \? it works very well i keep this in my car so when i travel i do n't have to worry about my palm tx 's batteries	7
1	this is the 5th palm treo case i have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far it holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap the clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot it is slim and works great	7
1	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
1	great phone durable and so far dependable i did buy a larger battery there is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk i do n't know if it is the service or the phone	7
1	the cover design is well made based on the requirements the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case	7
1	i 've had the battery for about a week now simply love it i'm a heavy user of gps applications and power vision for web surfing on the go i used to charge the phone twice a day now i charge it once a day and sometimes i even forget to plug it in at night and i still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day even when i forget to charge it has n't died on me this is a great deal at 16 shipping vs the one sold at sprint stores for around 60	7
1	i'm very happy with this purchase overall this battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone talk time and internet time are increased greatly i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast though that is still better than the original battery it may just be the phone i have no idea if it is as good as the one sprint sells for 60 dollars it is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long	7
1	i just bought this battery at a sprint customer service store and i paid 64 64 with tax in california i can buy 4 of these batteries here at amazon i'm going to return it today and buy it online here should have checked first	7
1	this battery is as good as they say it is i have not ran out of power yet	7
1	the only complaint i had about my a900 was the battery life i am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly with this extended battery i am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping	7
1	i initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained about until i applied the fix palm has identified that the treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used the camera may continue to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode treo 680 users should install the treo 680 camera update to address this issue	7
1	upgrading from the treo 650 it is true that there is n't much new also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non megapixel camera leave one frustrated but the fact remains that the treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good pda functionality or are a palmos devotee so i accept the current palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries not elegant but it works that does n't mean that i wo n't tell palm guys get your act together and come out with something far better !	7
1	i needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving i do in traffic but i did n't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear i took a chance on this headset even though i read a review saying that it did n't sync up well with the vx8300 i could n't be more happy even though it is small \( about 1 1 2 \) the buttons are still large enough to use with ease it also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my vx8300	7
1	the headset is great works really well with my samsung phone the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and i would buy it agai	7
1	a very good product for traveling people with gprs internet access the charger is good when you are away of power the mpt version is ok but more value is for seem editing \( for professional and expert users only \)	7
1	the headset works fine people who i talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but i doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset	7
1	the mp3 player is simple to use accessible while the phone is closed and sounds great you can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gym rats or runners alike sturdy fairly easy to figure out and fine reception a great phone if you do n't need smartphone features	7
1	sony ericsson w710i is a very nice cell phone 850 900 1800 1900 gsm pedometer bluetooth gprs ir 2mpix camera mp3 player \( 512 mb included \) and so on this baby is loaded	7
1	the original battery never lasted an entire day if i talked very much with this replacement battery i never run out of power anymore i do charge it every night the battery is a little bit thicker than the oem but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip the new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly	7
1	i received my phone and everything was good when i looked at my bill amazon did not close out my previous 2 months i had left on my contract with cingular so cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of 30 i called and had it removed	7
1	i have only had this phone for a few days now but i have used every feature it has to offer i must say that this is the best phone i have ever owned the only real problem i have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons i did n't intend but it 's really not that big of a deal i just need to re train my hands i am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality the audio options are great for me as all i really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and motorola made this a pretty simple task	7
1	this phone is incredible and i'm so happy i bought it through amazon very good deal and smooth transaction ! i definitely recommend getting this phone here 's my run down of it pros excellent voice qualityexcellent sound qualitygreat reception even in places that were dead zones with my other phones very compact and oh so sexy sleekdecent battery life \( much better than razr \) easy to follow menucons front side is a fingerprint magnet from hellsmall screenno warranty available with cingularonly a few backgrounds ringtones to choose from without downloading your owni also bought the data cable package through amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try	7
1	i just received this phone free as part of verizon wireless 's new every two program my main gripe with the phone is that unlike my former phone \( motorola v265 \) it cannot be set to display the time in the 24 hour format \( i do not use am pm \) otherwise the screen is nice and bright it 's easy to use it 's much less bulky than my former phone and the voice activation is easier	7
1	i switched to this phone from verizon e815 some of the details i find different pros sleek designgood battery lifecompact2mp cameracons choppy voice sometimes hard to listenscreen and buttons little smallworks for me as i do n't use the phone for internet email or use lot other features	7
1	great new phone here advanced video captures decent zoom and playback ability great for travel with excellent sounding mp3 player integrated bluetooth ready and big hard drive for tunes real good looking design as well so far so good	7
1	for the price this cover is great it 's thin easy to dial through and see through easy to get it on and off no complaints i just wish i had it sooner before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen i have dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine	7
1	i 've used this model headset for 6 months and the sound quality is great i drive a truck for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck the windstop technology works good i wear it about 6 7 hours a day the earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort only problem is it disconnects sometimes at rest it beeps when it disconnects and reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two would \( and have \) recommended to friends	7
1	i just got the cable and the software for my motorall v600 and it 's very easy to use i just did a backup of all my contacts pics and music	7
1	is good protecs every corner of your phone the keyboard and the screen ! its very good ! 100 recomendation	7
1	good price good color selection i liked it better yet my mom loved it	7
1	i really like the fit and function of this cingular 8125 case all the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable \( no sharp edges to irritate \) i ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and i sent them back this one is a keeper	7
1	the charger works great and charges quickly shipping was also quick \( 3 4 days \) my only complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long wish it was longer	7
1	bought this for my new samsung blackjack appears to be a genuine samsung accessory works well what more is there to say	7
1	soft leather attractive look and very easy to use over the top strap easily secures blackberry in place blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holster i purchased this with my brand new blackberry \( 8703e \) and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster the only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time i would definately recommend this item	7
1	this is the prettiest one i think ! there are other pinks but they are tacky this mauve is the perfect pink for my taste do n't ever discontinue this item these are great	7
1	i really like this case it keeps my phone from getting scratched up and it 's really cute good price	7
1	received the product on time and its working fine but its a bit harsh on the ears	7
1	although the i607 \( blackjack \) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly the earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly	7
1	good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it thank	7
1	product was what was offered and came quickly no hassle great seller and amazing price	7
1	i travel a lot so something like this i would use to replace all my other usb cables its compact and easy to store away i forget which seller i purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick	7
1	not looking to spend the cash for bluetooth but need something to work \? this is it with the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone very happy with the purchase	7
1	this headset is actually really comfortable i really do n't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly the sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well great product and great price	7
1	i had ordered this case just for my wife and it fit like a glove we both have sprints katana and you cannot find a better case at its price a definate buy	7
1	i bought this for my sanyo katana phone which is a bit thicker than the razr the fit is snug but not too tight my only problem is that due to the design i sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the katana when i take it out of the case	7
1	i love this phone cover it looks amazing i am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached	7
1	this cover is what my baby blackberry needed to be protected and safe	7
1	it 's just as advertised the cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord that 's just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for charging syncing the 8125 use it every day	7
1	i just bought this headset for use with an lg vx 8300 the stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone \( has microphone built in \) works fine	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	srudy phone during all scenarios mp3 player is great no compatibility problems the software supplied lets you replace your pda with this phone the camera is more than decent \( much like the 1 0 2 0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past \) no problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance the flip phone factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away form your brain the surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches tiny design details that make it a sony product amazing battery life surprising for an mp3 phone	7
1	hey this is a great phone i have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly i have never owned a sony ericsson phone before but i am really happy the camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception definetly a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one	7
1	ordered 2 cables from dln they shipped quickly keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged they are good quality and work well i like that it charges the phone as you sync up highly recommended and at such a good price	7
1	cable is cheap works perfectly and arrived quickly all you have to do is download the software from the samsung website and plug it in	7
1	when i ordered this item i already knew it did n't come with the driver software cd but minutes after i ordered it dln sent me an email telling me that i was able to download the software for free from samsung and event sent me the link that was nice of them i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature does n't work on my phone \( d807 \) but that 's just an issue with my phone i guess and nothing with the product	7
1	this cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere i received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the samsung website works great	7
1	i ordered this usb cable for my samsung sync and it came fast while there is no software provided i quickly found out it syncs with windows media player so i could add music to my phone after searching i found that samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for free ! if you want to fully utilize your sync 's camera and mp3 capabilities i highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to samsung 's site for the free software	7

1	if you own a q you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible this charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery which is great so i can charge my phone with the standard battery and have the extended one verizon sells in the back slot never having to worry about battery life again also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the usb cable you get data conectivity too only downside it wo n't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged	7
1	many people are having issues with the 2 5 mm to 3 5 mm adapters and treos this adapter works fine in my treo 650 the plugs fit fine \( i got the 2 pack \) and i get stereo sound through both headphones if you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will not get stereo sound my crappy panasonic headphones and better sony \( isolation \) headphones work fine with this adapter maybe i'm just lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine if you want sterling sound you should n't be listening to mp3 anyway i can hear the limitations of my files on the treo so it 's clearly good enough	7
1	this is the kind of thing you do n't care about unless it malfunctions i 've had no problems at all with it it seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily the right angle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device \( a problem with straight plugs \) it does n't seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well	7
1	i wondered if the snap on concept would feel and look secure it does it 's rock solid and looks like it 's part of the phone additionally the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful i 'd love to buy more colors when if they become available	7
1	i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr v3m it fits very well and looks very nice	7
1	great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company	7
1	the cable works great with my sgh 707 but the cd did not have the right driver however you can download the correct driver from samsung com i recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for your phone	7
1	the cable was perfect exactly what i needed but it took way too long over ten days to get here	7
1	holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case ! clips to belt and holds tight since the phone is horizontal and not vertical i do n't have trouble catching it on things i 've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car the phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap this case works great and eliminates that problem ! the perfect solution	7
1	this case is made for an l6 the l2 uses the same case so they both fit within this rubber case however the keys are laid out differently on the l6 so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys i did n't give it a low rating because it 's well built and is actually a really great product just wanted to give other l2 owners a warning it works well but it 's just a little funky on an l2 but totally usable for the price you just ca n't beat it and it 's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket	7
1	this was better than we thought it would be even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile would have liked something to protect the screen overall great protection for the price looks better in hand than the pictures on line	7
1	after about a year the ear support on this bluetooth headset broke bad news good news it has a 2 year warranty and logitech is replacing it with a mobile traveller model since the mobile freedom is no longer made contact logitech tech support audio by phone \( ca n't be done over the web \) it 's nice to see a company stand behind their products way to go logitech	7
1	this is my first blackberry phone and i must say it 's an awesome device ! my husband has a blackberry through his work so i got one too how we can pin each other keep in touch via email etc while he is away the pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc i highly recommend it	7
1	this product was perfect all i needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc highly recommended	7
1	neat cable good connectors but have n't established communications between pc and cellphone with cable yet	7

1	this is a great phone for a first phone for kids i have had it for six months and it is the best one i have ever had i like it so much that i do n't wanna get rid of it	7
1	i have a motorola v220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month the cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet it 's fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough a small red led lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether you 're charging your phone or not i debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price	7
1	this phone is a great corporate phone it is the best windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion they overlooked a few features there is no lcd light to tell you its charging status instead the screen has to be on all the time there is no way to know when the num lock key is on so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up in order to unlock the phone you have to press the on off button at the top of the phone which is not in a very convenient location the track wheel feels pretty cheep	7
1	product is ok do n't think it 'd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up but it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes	7
1	i bought the item form eforcity it is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works since it let me use my headset for my cell phone	7
1	i was concerned with the 1 star review so i ordered from desirepro \( who had a higher rating \) instead of eforcity i received my order promptly and it works well	7
1	i used the seidio rubberized case before this it is thinner and the pearl is barely noticed in a pocket this case is about 1 2 inch wider and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top the phone slips in and out effortlessly it looks great and the magnet puts it to sleep which is nice even though it is a bit more bulky i ca n't go back to the seidio because of the protection and looks i just use a screen protector but many use best skins ever with it no problem it 's also pretty cheap \( 15 \) less than the seidio and other pouches out there	7
1	you can pretty much do anything you would like with this product ! ! the only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in other then that you can manager anything you would like	7
1	after talking to cingular i found out that i would have to spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807 to my laptop but the only package they had included headphones which i did not want i foud this cable on amazon and saved 30 you can download the software needed from and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan	7
1	had heard other replacement styluses did n't quit fit properly these fit my cingular 8125 perfectly	7
1	these replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus	7
1	works just fine ! delivery was earlier than predicted i am well satisfied i looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they did n't have them i was told they can order one i thought to myself so what so can i this was much easier i ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my door no muss no fuss this is the way to buy such items ! thanks for a great job	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	compared to the face out belt clip i had previously this face in version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far hopefully it will remain so for the price it 's not too hard to appreciate	7
1	you ca n't beat this price this holder works great you must remove your phone before answering it make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip i put it in backwards at first the phone wo n't stay in that way	7
1	this is a great holster really cheap price i ordered a couple this time because it 's only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money it 's great	7
1	i bought this case for use at work i work in a semi dusty shop environment i'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well i do n't have to worry about the screen getting scratched \( the screen on the sansa e2oo series scratches very easily \) with the hard plastic screen protector i am very pleased with the speck toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co workers	7
1	while i thankfully have n't had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely the only thing i would change is to give it a fixed belt clip	7
1	great case protects my sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push decent sansa products are hard to find thank you speck	7
1	great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user strong and looks good it even comes with a clear plastic screen saver i am very happy with this product	7
1	this is a must for anyone that is 'mobile' i am never home always at starbucks or libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player	7
1	i'm a previous owner of body glove cel phone cases \( a moto v810 \) i purchased this item from amazon a few days ago for my 6255 my cel fits perfectly the case protects every part of my cel \( buttons screens jacks \) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice my next phone will have its body glove case too	7
1	i got this case holster a while back after another maker 's fell apart in a short time i was impressed with the reviews i saw here what i would add is that the case is durable and i am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months	7
1	this case was a perfect fit for my mot v180 phone the top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it ca n't easily fall out \( a problem that i 'd had with a different product \) the part that slips over the top of the phone has a built in see through window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case the quality of construction looks to be pretty good too	7
1	i was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone i wanted a holster that was n't a sloppy generic model that did n't fit i was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and i tried it on my motorola v180 it fits like a glove and looks good no complaints here so if you have a v180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you wo n't be disappointed the added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer	7
1	this is a great case ! i have a motorola v180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes did n't line up because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc this case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close the phone does n't affect the placement of the holes etc in the case also the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent	7
1	after reading the reviews here of this case i thought i 'd take the plunge and try it the cases i 'd seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper this is a wonderful case the materials are first rate and the fit is perfect i highly recommend this case	7
1	from longviewer 's advice i got this case and he was right on ! ! ! ! awesome custom fit ! ! great case for the money thank you ! ! ! gar	7
1	this device works great i use it on a usb laptop to charge the treo 650 i also use it on a wall outlet and the car no problems the cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient it does not come with a case so you 'll use your own bag or whatever the part that fits into the treo is very secure it does not pop off like other chargers the only thing i can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged	7
1	retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wires chargers and you name it junk in our console between the van seats	7
1	we were deperate for a charger the local stores seemed to be out of them and we got it overnight as requested unbelieveably fast thank you thank you thank you !	7
1	functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in cellphone stores excellent product for the price i bought two one for home and one for work	7
1	the included software for the usb cable does not have software or drivers for the env vx9900 price is right for the car charger though so i am not mad	7
1	skin was great and was shipped as described it really helps protect my q i like the texture of the skin feels like rubber overall it 's worth buying it really protects my q from scratches	7
1	nice price point good quality ca n't complain	7
1	great little item charges phone and second battery at the same time it is nice to have it on the desk and i can use the speaker phone on my desk no complaints about this charger at all	7
1	belt clip is sturdy velcro is velcro \( it 's solid but the separation noise can be annoying when you 're trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting \) love the flexability of the side connectors allowing quick access to the phone comfortable and fairly low profile i have a samsung d807	7
1	shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product is of great quality	7
1	this is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look	7
1	though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first it quickly becomes a non factor and though it does n't provide quite as much extra life as i had hoped it would it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry a solid purchase	7
1	this car charger for the blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price it is well made and works perfectly i also use it to charge my motorola bluetooth headset that has the same usb mini jack	7
1	i had been using this product for 2 weeks now no problems discomfort quality stuff	7
1	these cases were not available when the pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant good quality item at a great price thank you	7
1	besides all the functions described above the cable has one more function it can be used as a charger too ! this is really cool the company 's service is great for every order i put i received the products within 3 4 days at the price of ground shipping fees	7
1	this battery has much better life than the battery that come with the q i would say you can do twice as much talking surfing texting etc while charging it about as often there are higher mah batteries available for the q but they cost 49 59 so for 13 or so this is a pretty good deal the only downside \( and maybe i just did n't read description well enough \) is that the battery door is silver which looks dorky on my black q	7
1	though still not quite enough battery for the juice sucking q it is worlds better than the included battery i would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies	7
1	the battery was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly will do business again the battery make 's the phone last 2 days even with continued use	7
1	great buy if you use your q like i do i watch movies play nes games listen to music oh yeah make call send text messages etc good investment	7
1	this product was a great deal these can be found other places for over 20 if you are like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you	7
1	i really like this case ! it is easy to put on and take off it does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen it does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and i think it makes my phone easier to hold i would like for more colors i would really like for something to glow in the dark so that i could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse	7
1	people keep asking me hey what kind of phone is that \? im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie hollar at ya boy	7
1	i have tried 4 5 of theses phones over the last 4 years this one works the best of all i have tried the latest was the cingular 8525 \( htc makes it \) and it dropped 80 of incoming calls on pickup and 20 of outgoing calls i thinks windows was loading a dll \( lt \) \) \) the palm os is much quicker to respond to input than the windows based sps	7
1	i just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it it is my favorite phone i have had to date some people ask me what can that thing do \? and i respond to that what cant it do this phone can do anything you really want the features are nicely made to be used especially since it has a beautiful 2 2 in touchscreen the display is incredible i can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do the last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance	7
1	i 've had my treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications i especially love having the goodlink email application my family videos mp3 's pics and all my office documents at a touch of a finger yes the battery life goes quickly but i do n't mind charging my treo every night the slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand in the one month of usage my treo has hung one time a simple reset fixed it and has n't hung since	7
1	overall i am very happy with this product it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkier my only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open	7
1	i think this would work better with a money type clip however since verizon does n't carry anything like this in clear this works	7
1	my chocolate phone is obviously valuable to me so i want to keep it in tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phone with ease	7
1	promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones for the price of one from the original vendor they work great ! they hold a charge with normal use for about two three days as did our original ones when we first purchased them would buy again if needed	7
1	i got a bunch of these and they work perfectly enjoy	7
1	the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes i 've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone pda features i bought a 4gb mini sd card \( samsung memory \) from ebay for 39 99 combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for 110 they 're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2 5mm jack	7
1	recently decided to purchase the treo 750 but after ordering amazon sends shipping info and it wo n't arrive for about a month and a half ! i cancelled and went to cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately sad	7
1	treo 750 one of the best and coolest phone i am in love with this phone because of windows os it is very easy to use and understand functions slim and light weight love the touch screen function i ordered this phone on sunday evening and got it on wednesday amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones also i ordered two phones \( family plan \) there was some problem in other phone i requested the replacement and amazon first sent me the replacement of that phone through free 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone i am so impressed with amazon 's service	7
1	i bought my treo 750v a couple of days ago i got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery the only problem i am facing is with setting my voice mail the icon shown in the today page does not accept any number i will to attach to it as a result i was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number i really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by palm with a downloadable file because except for this problem treo 750 is really great	7
1	otherwise it would have 5 stars fits my treo 680 even in the case which is a big plus	7
1	hi im a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone before all i had was a phone booth but now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen thanks for the phone	7
1	my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i 've ever heard i do n't know what it 's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time including him it 's great for a business that has many locations i only give this product four stars because i have n't tried it myself so i do n't know all the features but i hope the review i 've provided helps	7
1	i really like the javoskin for my treo it 's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable the material is soft to the touch but strong on protection i do n't like the lanyard they send with the product it 's about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces i prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist	7
1	i tripped and basically threw my treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk with the skin on it no harm done none this is the second skin i 've owned the first from javoskin and i like this one better than the first the skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use i did n't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first but i did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag i highly recommend this product whether or not you use the cord	7
1	the quality of the product is very good i love the fact that i can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor ! the only thing i dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear but who cares its a great product for a great price	7
1	idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places with this cover it is definatly protected i do n't like the smoke color but who really cares for the price	7
1	this item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it does n't easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it	7
1	this holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt the flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device it does just what you want it to do	7
1	this is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt my husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks i would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls	7
0	this product was so disappointing that i discarded the entire box after trying one bar there are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste	8
0	sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more i havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time you cannot return these or any food items to amazon the coconut was moist and tender yet no good flavor taste smells of cheap food grade oil the spirulina is too try and chalky too much dried spirulina in one bar again bad taste no good alive flavor spirulina and cashew coconut agave nectar elisha elishachristian earthlink ne	8
0	silly me ! i assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews but the only ingredient you can taste in them or any of their other flavors is dates if you really love dates go for it otherwise forget it	8
0	i agree with the person who said it 's hard to chew and here is why disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair \? it is \( allegedly \) all made of cow hair gross ! that is the beef part i guess trans fat \( partially hydrogenated veg oil \) and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good \? no thanks glad i did not buy 100 ! my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog 's p peewww ! ! !	8
0	slim jims may taste ok but that 's because they are so greasy that 's what helps the flavor i ca n't figure out why anyone would like these as i ca n't seem to chew them to a point where i feel comfortable to swallow it 's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat the amount of fat cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky i 'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff at least i can chew the beef jerky	8

0	flavor is just passable the cracker is too thick have not found a topping that will soften it	8
0	i had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant so i ordered this one and i should n't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange not pleasant now we 're stuck with 12x4 of something we do n't like hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake	8
0	wow ! i use pacific foods beef and chicken stock all the time i guess i expected more ! convenience is n't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed ! ! ! ! hardly any barley or beef ! i cooked up one bag i'm throwing the rest out	8
0	scant vegetables and beef surprisingly little barley gloppy texture much too salty does not taste fresh needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible hard to believe but campbell 's is better	8
0	i really enjoy organic foods so when i came upon this item i was thrilled they were making organic popcorn especially newman 's own a brand i 've liked in the past i have to agree with the other poster the flavor is bland and almost flavorless there are other brands of organic popcorn that i 've found more recently that are far better do n't waste your money on so many of them ! !	8
0	this popcorn is rather bland i purchased it because generally i like newman 's own brand and i liked the idea of organic popcorn but it is flavorless i would not buy again	8
0	i ordered a 12 pack of this broth and so far i 've received a total of 3 bottles 1 original order and 2 replacements amazon still has n't sent me the 12 pack and now instead of correcting my order they want to cancel it and refund my money i 've been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still have n't helped me i strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product	8
0	purchased these for my sons lunch box and ca n't do it they are too salty he 's always been happy with veggy booty and that is what he 'll continue to get	8
0	the jerky seemed to be old and hard and was too tough to chew it also was a little bland for me i did like the peppered jerky much better	8
0	we ordered the favorite assortment pack but that is not what we received when we questioned our order we were told they were out of stock on our original order and we could not return the order we received we wo n't order again	8
0	only recieved one instead of 12 boxes and amazon not able to fix still waiting for remainder of orde	8
0	i tried it also as a less expensive alternative and wo n't be ordering again the flavor just tasted off to me kinda like old coffee that 's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours did n't have that freshly brewed taste	8
0	because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet well this stuff is just what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless i ca n't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it as i ca n't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good it makes kraft mac and cheese seem very exciting ! i would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from annie 's this would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it	8
0	the balls were squeezed into the box and flattened the taste is not very peanutty i'm disappointed	8
0	i bought both the ahi tuna jerky and salmon jerky both were dried out and brittle absolutely the worst incredibly the salmon jerky was worse \( i e drier harder \) than the ahi tuna jerky	8
0	most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed they put no expiration date on the bags so i do n't even know if i was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way on top of this they were too spicy my dog seemed to enjoy it though the ahi tuna on the other hand was great	8
0	this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it does n't release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth i had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and i'm not sure what to do with them i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up ! what a waste of money go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned this product is a joke	8
0	melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands and i really like that each pod is individually wrapped i bought this because the senseo hazelnut was not in stock at the time caution senseo coffee maker users the melitta pod does not fit well in the senseo pod holders the single pod holder is too small for the melitta pod and the double pod holder is too big for one melitta pod too small for two melitta pods i found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side but this may only be because i used it in a senseo machine	8
0	maybe i'm daft but i ca n't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine i 've tried tamping them which does n't work well and i 've tried just placing them in the filter in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso as with other european products \( think ikea \) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings perhaps i'm just doing something wrong i like the concept of pods but i 'll stick to beans instead	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	taste great but the cap on the bottle does n't seal very well so when it is shipped they leak you can not take it with you without putting it in another container	8
0	really strange cardboard mushy texture flavor can be sickening at times but you get used to it i wo n't buy this again i am not sure this is even beef has a strange taste not sure where the other reviews came from \? \?	8
0	who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange i love beef jerky especially peppered and hot spicy varieties but this jerky lacks the chewy ness that i expect in a quality beef jerky this stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy grainy consistency the flavor is n't bad but after reluctantly finishing the first bag i ca n't bring myself to open the second one perhaps i was n't paying proper attention but i was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in brazil i would not have purchased it if i had known this	8
0	although this is a good coffee i was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino this coffee tastes nothing like it it does n't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests if you want regular coffee then this is the coffee to buy but if you 're looking for cappuccino save your money	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	i picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that pirate 's booty was a great product these tasted rather odd to me and i wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just do n't go well together in my opinion it might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here	8
0	after searching high and low i found a site for 'nossa familia coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in brazil ! i guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods the site is www familyroast com and i highly recommend i	8
0	this mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a lot of crumbs inside the packets	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	i want to let you know that i received my order in today 's mail im unhappy to say this but the taste of this coffee is terrible i would have been better off if i had thrown my 37 00 out my car window these coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site i know you guys can not refund my money on this order but i am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how i feel about their coffee products the taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach if i were you i would post this commit under your customer 's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee	8
0	then this is n't for you horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that i definately do n't care for not to say that you will not however if you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this is n't the one to try	8
0	i bought these pods on amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store now i know why when i opened the package the senseo watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee buyer beware i am back to buying pods at the grocery store	8
0	these cookies were ok just ok i may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies every last cookies was broken i understand this is probably due to poor packaging the consistency was a bit grainy and dry though and milk did not help next time i 'll purchase a chewy brand or mrs fields	8
0	i received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas the chest is beatiful and will be great for future use however i am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea although the bags are highly aromatic the tea is very bland as if the bags were old i am sure bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty just not the box i received	8
0	liked the idea of the box but the tea tasted smelled like glue or paint or both once i removed the tea from the box it was ok	8
0	i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee most of the time i would just give up again the other brand of coffee i use never does this not getting this coffee anymore i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all donna marylan	8
0	i 've tried this coffee with all size settings it is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size and if it was stronger i still do n't think i would care for the flavor it just does n't taste like good colombian coffees that i 've had not even close this is definitely one i would not purchase again	8
0	this is very weak coffee do not buy unless you like it that way	8
0	i opened one packet \( which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office we all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible no one could continue eating it and i sent back 8 of the 9 packets not edible in our humble opinion sorry	8
0	this coffee does n't have anything special about it i like good kona coffee and i think 2 stars really tells it all	8
0	save your money and buy folger 's this coffee assuming it is kona as advertised is a lame example of the variety awfu	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	first of all the tea chest is disappointing to say the least the chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic the tea its self is alright sadly nothing special this item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after i opened it a few dozen times needles to say this product way disappointing all around	8
0	i was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews starbucks is good but i prefer bolder taste imagine my surprise when i ordered 2 boxes both were expired ! one expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes i admit that amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired ! ! ! i'm hoping to find local san diego area shoppe that carries pods so that i can try something different than starbucks	8
0	they are kindof on the bland side and i 'd rather spend my calories elsewhere ! but they are on the low carb side 150 calories 7g total fat \( 2g saturated \) 8g sugar 5g fiber 1g sugar alcohol 10g protein	8
0	my sister worked at starbucks so i used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion i have a pump espresso machine but only a cheap blade grinder which should tell you that i'm only about mid range on the coffee snobbery scale that said i prefer the starbucks espresso to this in spite of the drastic difference in price when i buy it retail again though i'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much i only know what i like the taste of in fact i only drink it in lattes 4 shot lattes but lattes none the less	8
0	this coffee had an off sour taste it 's almost as if it went bad as in milk that 's past the date i only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag i certainly wo n't be ordering this brand again	8
0	these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected	8
0	i brought this tea thinking it was a great deal then while steeping my tea i noticed something in the bag at first i thought it was a rock but it looked like a garden snail i cut the bag open and it was a garden snail ! yuck ! i checked several bags and approx 50 of them had snails in them this is the worst tea experience i 've had	8
0	i was very disappointed in this product i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out 20 i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not	8
0	i tried this once you can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery popping it pouring it into a bowl and adding milk this made me reluctant to try other kashi products frankly i do n't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn ps amazon should add a zero star rating	8
0	the box arrived opened and although the packages were individually wrapped i opted not to eat them they also looked very oily and not fresh i got a refund after some time and numerous emails	8
0	i absolutely agree with the two other reviewers i had very high hopes too as i use mccann 's brown bread mix all the time i do n't think i could live without it so i was very disappointed with the fruit scones mix there is a very weird taste to me it seems like 'soapy' or something but definitely not a pleasure to eat i 've got tons of bags left of this mix which i will have to throw away i would definitely not recommend this product sorry	8
0	really dry and just not as good as could be a disappointment after using this companys other products	8
0	we are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones the mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after taste my husband who will eat just about anything threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one we had high hopes but sadly this product just did n't deliver	8
0	i bought about a million of these pods for my single serving senseo machine they do n't fit one is too big for the single brewing well and two are too big for the double your only option is one pod in the double brewing well and the coffee comes out very weak just like this product	8
0	we have been buying the melita buzzworthy dark roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied recently they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines i also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling at the time melita made these changes i believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good accordingly i rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars we are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee	8
0	when i think dark roast i think full bodied and dark melitta pods are the worst i 've tried i 've tried senseo pods too which are only mediocre i did find the target brand archer farms pods to be the best the french roast really does rival starbucks home brewed its cheap too 3 99 for 18 pods if you like a full bodied rich dark and strong cup of cofee do n't do melitta i found senseo and archer farms pods fit in my melitta pod brewer just fine	8
0	this coffee was over three years old and was not drinkable very stale personally i ca n't believe amazon would sell a grocery product this old amazon did give me my money back	8
0	date on bottom of can shows an expiration of june 2007 i would expect a longer shelf life also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat this generally equates to bone fragments i'm not confident with this product	8
0	mushroom soup is one of my favorites so i was very disappointed in this version i agree totally with the first reviewer this is one bland and tasteless soup i'm only giving it any stars at all because it is organic and the attempt is appreciated	8
0	ordered a melitta 10 cup coffee maker and on the same page was an ad for the melitta filters they were very expensive and when they arrived they were not for a 10 cup melitta i advised the company but my complaint went to dead ears ! buy your filters at the local store they are cheaper	8
0	highest quality wholesome ingredients my aunt ida seriously how do companies get away with this nonsense \? \? \? the first ingredient is corn syrup followed closely by sugar that the harmony line would even consider masquerading as a healthier foods company and then try to pawn off this rubbish it 's revolting i say do n't buy from them just on principle yours the food zealo	8
0	i bought a case of these from amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of excellent quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like haribro do n't believe it these are cheapo gummi bears no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore supermarket bigbox sells pretty squishy \( not very chewy \) and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet there 's no point in buying these	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	as another reviewer pointed out i received only one pack of coffee pods i was sent a replacement order with guess what only one pack of coffee pods again i am getting a refund i would not recommend purchasing this one	8
0	stay away ! amazon sent me 1 bag of coffee pods 18 pods in total not pack of 12 like advertised unless you want to pay 30 on 18 generic coffee pods stay away i will be returning my product asap	8
0	overall the nuts were soft and lacked the flavor we had hoped for for the price we could have done better	8
0	i love this popcorn ! unfortunately you did n't send me what i ordered you sent me natural not natural light	8
0	i have been buying stoneridge orchards products for a long time so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages but also the pouches were half open in the box what a rip of	8
0	while you could do a lot worse with other snacks much of the health benefit of eating fruit in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives high fructose corn syrup and dextrose are in many many grocery products but they are not natural as this manufacturer claims both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body hfc as it is called has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes i have not tried this product so i ca n't comment on the taste i would like to try a dried fruit product one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives	8
0	i 've tried many of the yogi teas and i really do n't like the taste of this one i recommend the rejuvination tea it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging but it has a much smoother taste	8
0	i was really disappointed with this item especially as it 's nutrition info is really amazing it 's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well it 's also dark green which is n't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with i am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available	8
0	i found these to be very dry and just taste like dates i like the raw revolution bars a lot better	8
0	pretty ok coffee nothing special but i suppose its a fair deal for the price we picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash and it has worked well for that but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice \) of course my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff so the comparison is not very fair	8
0	i'm not sure what i was expecting but this was n't it just tastes bad do n't know how else to describe it sorry but i could n't even get through one bag oh well	8
0	okay yes i know the brand is dr kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product however i have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita these are very crunchy and do n't have a whole lot of flavor additionally they were shipped and arrived expired if you are shopping for a super healthy cracker this may be it if you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita keep shopping this is not it my next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia	8
0	i did not get what i ordered in this case i got licorice but it was not the salt type i ordered	8
0	this snack \( lol \) tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month kinda looks like it too make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them very very dry	8
0	i thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants i was wrong they taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly also still had quite a bit of sodium	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	this is the best coffee i 've ever had very smooth with rich flavor	8
0	peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture after trying one package it was so bad that i had to throw out the rest of the case a waste of money	8
0	i bought both the ahi tuna jerky and salmon jerky both were dried out and brittle absolutely the worst	8
0	do not buy this product i donated my entire box to the local food bank cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies seriously stay away for this produc	8
0	this product is way too salty i did n't like it at all and neither did any of my family you ca n't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one	8
0	while i personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods i have to say the 30 i spent on this case of cookies was a waster neither of my children will eat them nor will i they have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have nature 's path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay the honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day	8
0	i was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews starbucks is good but i prefer bolder taste imagine my surprise when i ordered 2 boxes both were expired ! one expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes i admit that amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired ! ! ! i'm hoping to find local san diego area shoppe that carries pods so that i can try something different than starbucks	8
0	i ordered these and received less than 300 some of the packages had holes in them and melted bags i contacted the supplier and they did nothing to resolve the issue i would not order from them again	8
0	i have been an avid senseo fan for about a year however i was getting a bit bored drinking the same dark roast every morning \( i found the other flavors too mild \) so i was very happy when i saw the new flavors \( sumatra colombia kenya and brazil \) sumatra and columbia are the two that i liked i found the kenya blend to be mild and sweet even my wife who previously used hazelnut did not like it too much	8
0	i had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and or what looks like the droppings of crawly things i must say i generally love newman 's products and i was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt with natural products sometimes bugs get in them that 's part of the territory with organic matter but i found white grubs and little brown dots that were n't a part of the raisins in box after shrink wrapped box some boxes were fine and i ate the raisins in them but the majority were tainted i 'll need to be assured there 's been an improvement in quality control before i try newman 's snack pack organic raisins again	8
0	i am sensitive to wheat gluten and i swear this product has gluten everytime i eat a bowl of it i get sick i bought tons of this cereal because it does taste good but now i do n't know what to do with it because i ca n't eat it i think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel somehow it is getting contaminated i wish i could send it back it is too bad because it is a good product it 's just not gluten free	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	great looking beans unfortunately the packages are also full of drug store beetles a common pantry pest i could see them as soon as i opened the box why did they not catch this at bob 's red mill	8
0	the product has way too much liquid good for in a pinch	8
0	i expected this flavor to be as good as their lemonada and tangerine strawberry but it did n't even come close	8
0	i did n't like this at all i found it chemical and not nicely redolent of the ginger i o so love i just gave it away cute little tin and all i am adventurous so i do happen on things i feel are n't what i expected from time to time this was certainly one of them i'm sure some of you will like like it do n't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds mine said this tea is not a real peach either	8
0	i have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all however this sweet corn is all but sweet i would say it should be called salty corn i think they would have a great product if they did away with the salt also or change the name to salty corn cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company i dont think they would give the other products a try from there line myfavorite is cherry berry and orchard blend	8
0	i can hardly eat this for all of the salt it leaves you thirsty it 's so bad the ingredients list reads literally 100 organic sweet corn sea salt and nothing else they need to make it 100 organic sweet corn and nothing else and they 'd probably have something really great as it is i'm stuck with 23 1 2 bags of salty corn that i 'll have to give away	8
0	wo n't ship to hawaii hawaii is a state in the united states some seem to think it is a forign country damn fools !	8
0	you just throw this in the microwave and it 's ready in 60 seconds the drawback is that it is dry and essentially without much taste also the consistency is very slightly rubbery	8
0	all of the bags were stale however amazon 's customer service quickly corrected the issue by giving me a refund i think the whole batch was stale	8
0	it 's easier to make one from scratch and you electricity bill wo n't skyrocket	8
0	i beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan it baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture and was completely inedible when i very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund the customer service person said they could not give me a refund and said thank you for your understanding huh \? \? i 'll never purchase any more of their products	8
0	i purchased a case of angelfood cake and the first three i baked did n't turn out very well i ended up giving the other three boxes away	8
0	this cake mix was like water when i baked it it was like acake of paste ! ! itdid not bake well at all flat raw	8
0	there is n't much of a blend its just i think plain too spicy for a normal taste bud extremely hot for those of you who like it ! i like hot stuff but this is just too hot	8
0	the tea was good but i was looking for a box to keep around for a while and the felt lining hardly hides the fact that it 's a cheap particle board box	8
0	i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie 's products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware	8
0	the roast is a light medium tried various grinds with my wega espresso machine does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage look for a darker roast makes a pretty good drip	8
0	these pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well it could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong	8
0	i ordered the corn on the cobb popcorn since i could not find it in phoenix anymore it tasted just like regular buttered popcorn in the past the popcorn literally tasted like corn on the cobb my family fought over it ! not anymore !	8
0	this tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob in fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter on the positive side it 's not greasy but do n't expect anything exciting from the taste	8
0	i bought a whole box of these and they tasted really rancid they were several months from their expiration date so that was n't the problem maybe i just got a bad batch but i 'd be unlikely to ever try them again	8
0	i bought these simply because i wanted an easy snack and the reviews were pretty good i took two bites and stopped the second bite was because i really could n't believe that i disliked something that much the odor is pretty bad too these smell very medicinal almost like a commercial disenfectant next time you 're at a doctor 's office try licking the counter it 's like that not that i 've ever done that but i ca n't describe it any other way please try one of these locally if you can i would n't suggest buying them if you ca n't	8
0	i got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas this is undrinkable in fact it 's unsmellable i opened the tin and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural smelled and tasted like handcream yes i actually tasted it furthermore the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy the quality you 'd find in a no name tea from the dollar store the tab simply said ceylon tea it looks like bentley got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin i gave it one star for the tin if you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea do n't buy this one	8
0	this is the second batch i ordered i have had to contact representatives at brucepac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky i have enjoyed the same world kitchen jerky from other vendors so i cannot understand why the order from amazon has been such a disappointment	8
0	i ordered teriyaki original and black pepper flavored ones the other two flovors are quite good but this one teriyaki is really sub standard it has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others	8
0	when you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating otherwise the flavor was n't bad i just ca n't eat the dirt it 's bad for the teeth	8
0	way too sweet for beef jerky it was similar to drinking a soda	8
0	ok i bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct this jerky is not very good in fact i threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together trust me when people say this there is much better jerky out there i even e mailed the company and told them that i was very unsasfied with thier jerky they offered me a refund and i should of taken it but i decided not to	8
0	i tossed it out the texture is aweful and brittle only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible gross ! you get what you pay for	8
0	it 's not terrible but it 's not very good for the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better i sent 8 of the 9 packets back	8
0	i have never eaten these because well they 're not vegan they are in amazon 's vegan section however whey is not vegan it is the very first ingredient	8
0	i love the flavor of this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged packaging needs to contain a little tlc then it would be 5 stars do n't order if you need this for a certain dinner it may not arrive usable	8
0	i 've purchased this locally and it was delicious so i was happy to see a deal offered by amazon unfortunately it never made it to my door ups reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to amazon this seems to match what many other reviewers said	8
0	first quality tomato products should never be packed in plastic the high acidity may cause the plastic to leech into the food then these are pooly packed by amazon 2 orders both arrived cracked open as amazon just throws them in a box so they crack and make a nasty mess as for the sauce well it tastes fine but i think it is not well balanced very acidic we feel horrible after eating it for hours simple good ingredients so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick	8
0	but i may never know i ordered this item on october 27 when a shipment finally arrived there was only one container of this inside ! i ordered a four pack i'm sure so amazon offered to try again sending the item but it 's now november 30th the item has been in stock the whole time so i'm not sure what has caused the delay i'm just thankful i ordered it just to try it out and that i did n't actually need it by any certain date	8
0	i 've ordered this item twice from amazon and both times all of the plastic jars were smashed inside the packing box	8
0	i di n't love these at all the flavor combinations struck me as off there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa also the texture was unpleasant somewhat soggy i like the healthy aspect but if you are n't enjoying the experience why eat at all	8
0	hello i have not received this item please send me the delivery receipt details	8
0	got a deal on the machine and love the concept but every senseo coffee i have tasted has been absolutely horrible i 've tried 4 oz with one pod way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod still the most awful coffee i 've ever had normally i drink gevalia but i use folgers sometimes or millstone i do n't think i could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me of all the purchases i 've made at amazon this has been the first time i 've ever felt compelled to give feedback that in itself speaks volumes	8
0	i ordered the chocolate mint variety amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly however i ordered the cookies in early november and they arrived with a best when used by date of december 4 2006 they will expire less than a month after they arrived ! i'm not sure if this is amazon 's fault or not the cookies are shipped in the manufacturer 's back to nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on amazon com	8
0	i have to second the other reviewer 's comments about the partially hydrogenated oil that kellog 's is using in kid cereal ! \? ! \? it is the year 2006 time to start making these cereals healthy and without trans fat ridden cheap oils ! ! ! !	8
0	i was going to buy these until i saw that they contained trans fats \( partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in cocoa crispies fruit loops and corn pops \) who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats \?	8
0	i thought they had a stale texture and they did n't have enough salt ener g does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these are n't it hope this helps all the gluten free people like me	8
0	i'm sorry to give this a poor review but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it i often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful i ca n't speak for how well it works because i could n't drink the whole cup even though i attempted to force myself yogi makes some good teas but this i just could n't stomach	8
0	the sell by date on a package was less than a month so that they would not go bad i felt like i needed to personally eat more than i would have i have a retail store and i need a bit more time on new products this was a costly mistake also the wholesale price from the business itself was the same as amazon 's price except amazon gave free shipping and a discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! as a retailer i would think that i would be able to get a better deal from betty lou 's or get a reasonable sell by date very tasty and addicting	8
0	you have to really like spirulina to enjoy these the entire center is green too strong for my taste try the almond butter balls they are delicious	8
0	terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top the flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and i wondered what i was eating ! alone they were nearly tasteless and i 'll never purchase again yuck	8
0	i am a huge special k fan especially red berry but at heart i am a chocoholic i was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and i ran right out to try it it is your average special k flakes but with the addition of chocolate pieces the problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate i am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but i would rather have a fat free chocolate jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth so back to red berry for me	8
0	this is a strong blend when i want a cup of decaf i usually want a milder blend and after a cup or two of this blend i still seem to get jittery i question whether or not it is truly decaffeinated	8
0	the product is fine but the description is misleading each package contains 40 count that is 40 filters but this is not a \( pack of 12 \) as you would think from the description from the price reduction \( from 23 88 to 1 93 \) and from the shipping weight \( 4 20 lbs \) it 's just one box of 40 filters and you 'll pay as i did 11 for fedex to bring you this one box soon after i submitted this feedback i was issued a partial refund of 7 product description still needs correcting but at least customer service was responsive	8
0	the oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this is not an instant version of mccann 's irish steel cut oatmeal the oatmeal it is famous for i thought mccann 's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored i would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what i prefer and is much better for you	8
0	in amazon 's ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered the apple cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i 'd avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards	8
0	these were horrible i thought i 'd try raw foods and i amde a big mistake	8
0	is n't very tasty falls apart when taking a bite not recommended	8
0	i tried really hard to like this stuff you know organic and all that the elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy pasty and tastes like cheez whiz if you like cheez whiz you will love this mac cheez if not pass it by i 'd have given it to mikey but he does n't live at our house anymore my recommendation is to make your own from scratch it 's not that difficult and it 's so much better	8
0	there are bugs in the tea bags now these are n't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies these are the bugs that dig into expired produce there are about 4 5 bugs in each bag if you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed this is the product to buy also the tea bags are n't made from organdy it 's some sort of plastic polyester i burnt a bag and it melted turned black and glued onto itself horrible unethical company	8
0	reminds me of the fruit bars from my childhood that first came out around the time fruit roll ups did they seem to have some kind of strong odor to them but if you can get past that they do n't taste so bad	8
0	yeah so i really do not like this one bit the 'cheese' is horrid dose not taste like real cheese the noodles are ok a little soggy but ok and it leaves a nice layer of starch in your mouth as rachal ray wouldsay 'yumo ! 'anyway i hate it and spirals depress me	8
0	this type of mac cheese pasta does n't produce as much as the elbow mac cheese other than that it tastes the same good stuff	8
0	last time i order this sort of thing online i realize that 'raisins' was the first ingredient but they were n't even good raisins and the raisins outnumber everything else by a good margin it 's basically raisin and banana with a few other things thrown in the coconut is an afterthought and completely tasteless the sunflower seeds settled to the bottom it 's edible but it does n't taste especially good and 'tropical' is definitely misleading	8
0	i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son \( 6 \) does not like them	8
0	this peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy skippy a lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by palm oil they meant to write socks thoroughly disappointing i only finished the one jar i bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and i was n't about to waste it buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains fully hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike partially hydrogenated ones	8
0	tastes just like regular skippy i e unnatural texture because it contains palm oil	8
0	this is not a natural peanut butter the listed ingredients are peanuts sugar palm oil and salt natural peanut butter such as smucker 's and whole foods contain only peanuts and salt palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients	8
0	i drink all types of teas but this is one of the worst tasting teas in my opinion	8
0	please be careful i did not read the product description so i do not know if they mentioned this but kava can cause severe liver toxicity even without prior liver damage please consult your physician before taking this or any other supplement ! thanks	8
0	i bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety indigestion etc and i use and love the other flavors of yogi tea unfortunately i ca n't handle the taste of this one it 's just too strong almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy i normally like ginger but this is too much	8
0	i 've only been on a gluten free diet for four months so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid the worst part is that amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this i 'd put it out for the squirrels but i'm not sure they 'd eat it if you 're expecting something that tastes anything like bread you 're in for a shock	8
0	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
0	my wife and two year old like this cereal however i find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat i prefer the purely o 's just wish they came in an eco pack	8
0	although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes drinks our experience is it wo n't dissolve without a blender simply put it clumps the taste is fine actually good so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement	8
0	without any sulfites preservatives hydrogenated oils artificial colors or flavors but not without a great deal of sugar and high fructose corn sweetener like the previous reviewer i bought these at costco brought them back due to the sickly sweet taste there was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries if you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness watch the ingredient list on these sugar is the second ingredient by weight and corn syrup is the fourth	8
0	the quality of this tea is not very good especially compared to other superb teas by two leaves and a bud mostly powder inside the bag and has a very strong grassy smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste on top of that it took 2 weeks for amazon to deliver it	8
0	sadly this is pretty crummy tea for decent orange pekoe i remain sold on typhoo	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	i did n't like them too sweet and sticky my dog likes them though these just did n't do it for me	8
0	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	8
0	amazon shipped me a replacement for this order which was 7 months past the sell by date on the package the replacement was eight months past due yuck i wo n't even bother calling them on it i just wo n't buy any food product from amazon hey guys these things aren t books ! ! ! they go bad	8
0	ingredients high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oil do a search and see what you think i wo n't touch this stuff	8
0	i was so very disappointed with this cereal it 's taste is very sweet if you look at the ingredients it 's filled with sugar corn syrup and and more sugar i counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar ! it is also loaded with salt i would give this zero stars if i could because it has more sugar than most sweet cereals why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package \? absolutely ridiculous	8
0	as another viewer pointed out this product contains corn syrup not at all organic in fact the only organic thing in this product is the fig for those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you must read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate this goes for all products not at all an attack against paul newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic	8
0	contrary to the maker 's claims this product is not made with whole grain flour instead the first listed ingredient is organic unbleached wheat flour an unhealthful refined carbohydrate the product is sweetened with common refined cane sugar and corn syrup all things considered this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery store fig newtons except for the claim that it 's organic snacks like this could be made with healthful nutritious ingredients unfortunately this one is not i would not choose to buy it again instead of this junk snack i would choose barbara 's whole wheat fig bars which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices	8
0	bought dozens of different varieties of these all arrived way past expiration date and were terribly stale do n't chance it i'm not the only customer who has had this problems with these products	8
0	t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino i shoulda known betta	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	i really like splenda but this hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over chemicaled taste and just does n't have much nuttiness to it perhaps the other flavors are better	8
0	i'm afraid i disagree with the other two reviews i thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like it does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly it 's an ok substitute but there are much better gluten free pastas out there although the glutino is cheaper i personally like orgran pasta 100 times better	8
0	the almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring which is subtle but nice the cashews on the other hand are hard to believe the taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi pervious containers in the paint and finishing room of my high school industrial arts class they are really awful and any lover of cashews will be appalled	8
0	i would n't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered it 's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack the best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein still it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky the unopened tubes had gone bad \( mold \? or something \? ick \) within about 3 months	8
0	i 've tried this twice now and both times it had an off taste a bit rancid like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature i 'd guess that amazon 's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out	8
0	i normally buy special k cereal i found these boxes to be stale	8
0	it 's not the regular strong earl grey twinings i come to love this version lacks strength and flavor two teabags are needed for regular strength tea it 's even states on the box light flavour strenght \( 2 leaves out of five \) beware !	8
0	my tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six i called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six that is all i ever received and my money was refunded do n't really know what happened never got an explanation from the distributor	8
0	it is not the wonderful twinings earl grey you have come to know and love they have pulled a new coke blunder and now the best earl grey tea ever is available no more ! this tea is weak and tasteless i hate stupidity especially from corporate marketers	8
0	the newly re packaged twinings earl grey tea \( has the word classics on the package \) is much much weaker than the previous twinings earl grey tea if you used and like to the old teas then you wo n't like the new version i wonder if they have weakened the britsh version of twinings earl grey tea	8
0	i did not enjoy this soup i will try a different brand next time	8
0	i love most jack links jerky products however i was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste it tasted like a bunch of powdered old hot spices not a true fresh pepper cure i think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste i have not given up on jack links just ordered their turkey jerky	8
0	i was very disappointed with this product i was sure i had tried cherries from this company but these had an off flavor were extremely sweet i gave away the 4 bags i bought	8
0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not healthy	8
0	the cherries are listed as natural on the packaging there is nothing natural about high fructose corn syrup i am returning them	8
0	i thought these would be slightly sour like dried cherries i have enjoyed in the past no hfcs is high fructose corn syrup so these taste strangely sweet like weird raisins they are ok if i cook them in oatmeal or if i'm really hungry but i would n't buy them again if you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere	8
0	this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti	8
0	although i love the nana 's brownie mint and peanut butter flavor cookies i found the ginger cookie disappointing it was too spicy to be enjoyable and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors \( the crumbliness is due to the gluten free rice flour \) also the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors i 've had 360 calories per cookie compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories note that nana 's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving but they count a serving size as half a cookie	8
0	i purchased two of these packages in mid jan 2007 i have only finished one box \( of four \) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in \( only my personal theory \) i just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem and they have known about it now for a long time seems like they would have solved the problem	8
0	5 stars for the stevia product natural delicious ! 0 stars for amazon 's inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses i experienced the same trouble as other reviewers packets showing up hard and useless when purchased in the store i have never had one hard or brittle packet do n't bother purchasing from amazon instead head to your local trader joe 's where you can purchase 100 packets for 5 99 not the fiber supplement type but does n't clump and more per packet amazon really should n't even bother selling this product if the stevia shows up ruined	8
0	i ordered enough stevia packets to last me for 1 year most of the packets have the sugar hardened every so often i am finding one that is powder as it should be the others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard i will never buy stevia from the company i purchased from again i do n't have the receipt or i would have returned them asking for a refund i have been upset about the way they came	8
0	i drink lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant when i saw this on amazon i assumed it would be great but it is n't even though this is sold as drip grind coffee the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker the result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup and decent is as good as it gets not great not even very good just decent illy 's \( admittedly much more expensive \) drip grind delivers a much nicer smoother cup using 1 2 as much coffee so mabye it 's not all that much more expensive in the long run	8
0	i 've purchased this sauce at a retail bakery and it was fabulous i 've ordered it several times here and it never arrives usable jars are always smashed guess i 'll have to continue to buy it at a store very dissappointed ! !	8
0	it arrived rancid with mold in all 4 jars not so great i have purchased there other products and enjoyed but not this pretty gross overall	8
0	i bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries i was surely mistaken the raspberries are coated with sugar and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears ! gross	8
0	received shipment early january of 2007 to find out the expiration date was in 2006 buyer bewar	8
0	i recently tried this cookie and the ginger flavor they were both disgusting the texture was similar to a protein bar the flavor of the chocolate one was very weak contrary to the label which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor the other one was very spicy with no sweetness to cut the spice not a pleasant experience i did n't finish either of them	8
0	this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it 's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list \( which means that it is the highest mass ingredient \) is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed	8
0	amazon never sent the correct order i spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item i eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop tarts they kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12	8
0	like the idea of getting some samples but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles do not buy	8
0	wish i would have paid attention to this one the the previous review the cost for what you get is outrageous only reason i gave it one star is because there was no place to give is zero starts do n't waste your money like i did ! ! ! find a more economical product \( plenty more choices on amazon btw \)	8
0	the price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box this means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce this is the most ridiculous sham i have ever encountered the difference in price between this item on amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous \( this costs over ten dollars more here than at the grocery store ! ! ! !	8
0	sorry guys i do n't know if i was n't tasting real miso soup at my local restaurant but the thing is i did n't like this one bit and i still have lots of packages left ! haha i gave it a chance because i love the soup from the japanese restaurant i visited and i wanted to taste this soup whenever i wanted at home but i did n't like the flavor do n't know if i'm missing something but better buy one \( one \) a see for yourself	8
0	i had the exact same experience as heather shown below they sent me the less expensive non organic version of this product twice and then informed me that they could n't guarantee when the problem would be fixed remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated finally take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler 's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof do the math note to amazon this is a great product with fruit and nothing else in its ingredients please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids	8
0	i was looking forward to this item but i was sent the cheaper non organic version twice amazon informed me that they could n't guarantee when the problem would be fixed if someone orders this and gets the organic version please post i 'd love to buy these in the future !	8
0	these things are just plain disgusting if you are ever in need of emegency rope get these but otherwise i doubt they are fit for human consumption it feels and tastes like eating soft plastic and i would hate to think what they do to your insides i have battled to even give some of these away so they ended up in the trash can where they rightfully belong	8
0	i'm sorry but what on god 's green earth are these people talking about when they say the highest quality wholesome ingredients \? \? \? the first ingredient listed is corn syrup followed closely by sugar god i'm livid corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a major culprit in the obesity epidemic spare yourself eat a damn piece of fruit many thanks the food zealo	8
0	order arrive in good time the tea is not flavored enough with the vanilla can not taste or smell the vannilla	8
0	i do n't recommend any of baxter 's soups these are terrible a waste of money will not buy again amazon i'm beginning to see why item 's are on sale you want to get rid of them zero stars	8
0	kind of fishy tasting with a few potatoes floating in it along with a few green herbs not worth the price its not awful but not great eithe	8
0	it almost seems like i received a different soup based on the other 5 star reviews the broth is thin mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling do n't get me wrong it was edible but i wo n't be ordering another case of this flavor i'm still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors	8
0	although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it \( commonly called sushi vinegar \) the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling i have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant the soy sauce is ok but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush	8
0	these are a little mealy or grainy but are ok pretty high in carbs though	8
0	if you really like chinese food you might like this chicken stew however it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes the main reason that i give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner splenda \( see sucralose in the ingredients \) but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list i personally do n't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons and had i known the product contained splenda i would n't have purchased it honestly it has the typical splenda after taste	8
0	i too like the old smucker 's filled strawberry better \( aka fruit wheats \) this is ok but fruit filling is better they probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff	8
0	i wish that kellogg 's would return to the previous style of these the strawberry filled mini wheats the raisin filled and the blueberry filled were much better than these frosted varieties	8
0	bob 's red mill roasted oregon hazelnuts tasted stale and over cooked this is not a quality product and not good value for the money do n't waste your money on this item	8
0	my product should have been delivered a month ago this is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it i am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made	8
0	i bought two flavors of gloria jeans k cups i loved the price the coffee is wonderful \( ! \) but i hate getting grounds in my coffee ! i 've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup lower price poorer manufacturing standards	8
0	these were a sticky mess in the bag the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap they were also soft and seemed stale great ingredients but the final product was disappointing	8
0	i was trying these as a change of pace from the turkey jerky i normally eat they taste ok \( nothing special \) but several of the medallions \( in at least 3 bags so far \) had 'crunchy' bits in them i suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments not pleasant to eat i may have just gotten a bad batch \( other than the crunchy bits i 'd give these a 4 star rating \)	8
0	i had tried this tea before purchasing a large quantity from amazon what i received was disappointing i suspect old stock that was no longer fresh i will not purchase tea from amazon again since you were not willing to accept a return	8
0	that about says it all this cereal is just too sweet their flax cereal is better	8
0	not only is the popcorn incredibly salty but they do not taste very crispy quite stale overall disappointing i sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them so it is not that i kept them too long too bad they are too far to return overall a disappointing experience	8
0	i first bought chipotle flavor and love that one that is my favorite flavor the gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste so i will not buy this flavor again the quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent i will be trying other flavors in future just not this one	8
0	granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco 's granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that 's better	8
0	these are fine if they were n't supposed to have blueberries there are essentially none most pouches of the 24 do n't even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it 's a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that 's very rare avoid this variety	8
0	these were the absolute worst crackers i have ever tasted if styrofoam could be served in a box it would taste like these save your money	8
0	i bought a case they expire in one month they taste great but shame on amazon i also bough butter rounds they expired last year	8
0	the main ingredient should be salt ! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can come on we usually sweat or need more salt in the summer but we tend to eat more soup in the winter my first impression was boy this is salty it would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper cambell 's cream of mushroom	8
0	this pack of mac and cheese had an expiration date of 10 31 06 not that we 're talking about the most nutritious food to start out with anyway but i hate paying for items at near their expiration date i expected some reasonable amount of shelf life	8
0	this jello cheesecake mix is not nearly as tasty as their sugar free banana cream mix \( that one tastes like real banana cream ! \) this mix does not have the flavour of cheesecake and also has a vague chemically taste	8
0	i was disappointed with this powder i thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract but it does n't when used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed i wo n't buy it again i prefer using vanilla extract	8
0	pro no trans fat con no flavor basically tastes like cardboard my children wo n't eat it	8
0	when you can buy a 40 oz jar at the local grocery store for 4 59	8
0	i would love to have the above item actually really wanted it so much that i called about it twice both times i was sent 6 oz packages of pecans that i could have \( but probably would not have \) bought in any store my husband is extremely fond of the canned pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line i do n't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others sorry but i 'll have to really research the product before i order again ms judie cardwel	8
0	this product came to me packed in bags not cans disappointed	8
0	i ordered this mocha java because the green mountain brand was not available there is no comparison i am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe	8
0	i thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which is n't very tasty i 've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour tapioca flour and potato starch flour and they are a million times better wo n't buy these again i expected these to be as close to the real thing as the glutino crackers are to regular crackers \( not the tomato basil but the plain ones \) but they were n't	8
0	the title is wrong this item contains twelve 5 grams \( 0 0175 ounce \) packets not twelve 5 ounce packets	8
0	i would n't buy it again i like to try to new things and i had never had this before but it was n't that good yes my crew ate it they eat almost anything this is n't moving	8
0	i am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens i bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite sorry to say that we just did not like any of these a little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy	8
0	i should have listened to the reviews this is not a good product and will not buy again	8
0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not health	8
0	these apples are coated in sugar and other gunk \( like sunflower oil \) which gives them a strange taste i was very disappointed when i tried them i was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil sugar and preservatives now i'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good i also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse i will not be trying any more stoneridge orchard products be aware ! ! these products cannot be returned to amazon so be sure before you order	8
0	soft chewy a little grainy but a good flavor mine were expired a week after i bought a whole 12 pack \( do n't expect whole berries basically everything is ground together odwalla bar is much better definitely try the spirelina balls though a little bit of a green flavor the energy ginsing one is well worth the cost here and not almost expired	8
0	these may be healthy but you 'll have to force yourself to eat it it tastes like paste with some fruit i would give them one star but i give them some credit for trying to make something healthy	8
0	i purchased diamond pecans in their shells in december '06 \( note not these already shelled ones \) and discovered after the kids were eating them that they were all rancid be sure and check the dates \( if you can there were n't any on the in shell nuts \) because there 's not much worse than ruining whatever you 're trying to make with rancid nuts i have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where i can smell and taste them	8
0	perhaps it was just my microwave or cooking it too long but the two different types of this soup i have tried \( chicken with noodles and chicken with rice \) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of i would have thrown it out except it was the only thing i brought for lunch i do not recommend this soup	8
0	i could not believe how disgusting this product was i do not think it should be given a star at all i most certainly will not buy any of these products again \( i also bought the coconut balls \) this was such a waste of my money	8
0	i do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at these fill me up i know that they 're pretty good for you and i like the nutty essence too i guess that i really was disappointed in the taste though the chocolate was slightly bitter tasting and took me by surprise i love the other flavors but this one is my leat favorite i would recommend the almond butter balls before this one they 're soft and a little more on the sweet side	8
0	i eat pretty healthy and i'm always looking for new healthy snacks especially sweet ones ! ! but this purchase was a real disappointment the quality and quantity were fine but the taste was totally lacking if you 've ever had dr fuhrman 's date nut pop'ems this product is nothing like those i would say the primary taste is ground flax seed not a bad taste kind of mild but certainly does n't satisfy a sweet tooth	8
0	i read in a review that if you are on a blood thinner that this tea is not good for you what does it do that makes it unhealthy \? thin the blood more \? it did n't seem to affect my protime but i'm concerned	8
0	i bought these because they are described as 100 all natural dry roasted almonds now i read the label states that these contain maltodextrin modified potato starch sugar msg autolyzed yeast extract modified corn syrup solids modified corn starch salt	8
0	i was disappointed with this product i love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste they have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell they are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer you should also know that this food product cannot be returned i would have sent it back in a flash if i could have	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	i think that this mix does not taste as good or prepare as quickly as the liptun cajun rice and beans \( 6 4 oz \) not at all	8
0	this is a terrible tasting bar i have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst i 've ever tasted it leaves an after taste	8
0	worst tasting nutrition bar i have ever had and i 've probably tried over100 different kinds this one tastes like soap	8
0	this type of machine just cannot make good espresso espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans correct temperature of water and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time with a quick no fuss machine like the tassimo some of these ingredients are missing from this machine 's process so the espresso turns out rather sour adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it but it 's not a great latte either stick with regular coffee in the tassimo and although it 's not wonderful either it might get you through the morning	8
0	i suppose everyone who does gluten free baking is always searching for the holy grail that would make gf products have the same texture as non gf products this gluten substitute is not worth the effort save your money !	8
0	two of the six packages were beginning to mold but not even close to the expiration date one other package was visibly torn i was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air tight so i placed them in water five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal i imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude pressure i cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as i did not eat them the silver lining amazon has great customer service	8
0	the online product description lists the only ingredient as 100 natural cherries i ordered the product and discovered that it also contains sugar and sunflower oil buyer beware ! a better cherry choice is melissa 's dried cherries they do not contain any added sugar or oil	8
0	my own fault for not reading the ingredients but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading basically it 's a 10 bag of blueberry candy high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient oil and flavoring also added i do n't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after i ate it i actually had to brush my teeth twice this product should not be in the natural and organic category do n't waste your money	8
0	i love blueberries both fresh and dried but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste dried fruit is always naturally sweet added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy instead of a naturally healthy snack thumbs down for this one	8
0	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	beyond the glaring fact that most of their products are n't tomatoes this one is a blight on the just tomatoes ethos just but it has two ingredients it 's not just anything if it includes both bananas strawberries they do n't call cracker jack just peanuts popcorn and high fructose corn syrup nor is it just something when it comes in a package of 2 they do n't call a variety pack of cereal just grains and high fructose corn syrup the just tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it it goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco it 's just not right	8
0	there is no doubt that this tea does it 's job but the smell of it is awful i normally do n't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but i have such an aversion to the smell of this tea it has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad the box says that it contains delicious sasparilla i do n't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all if you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it	8
0	i tried one bite of this cracker and had to throw it away for fear of cracking my teeth buy the wasa 7 grain instead the 7 grain is light and crispy	8
0	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
0	not great coffee rocamojo and puravida which amazon also sells is so much better and those are n't great just good this is cheap coffee and tastes like it i ca n't complain much at about 3 a pound but it 's just ok drinkable but would n't buy again	8
0	i made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site i have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating i could n't taste any caramel or other flavor just straight sugar if you are considering this product and have n't tasted it before i highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you do n't waste your money	8
0	i thought i was getting a mix of some sort this is just an expensive condiment	8
0	the quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha 's i have tried the packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea particularly the fine powder i would not purchase this product again the quantity that i do have i will cut with other better tea rather than waste it if you do try this product use care opening the package because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling	8
0	this so called treasure is not a treasure at all a big disappointment	8
0	i'm sorry but these just were n't for me they have somewhat of a stale taste i recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant	8
0	i accidently picked these i really wanted the hot fries these just are not as good i guess if you like cheddar they are okay	8
0	this is just like cup noodles without the noodles eek	8
0	very sad to say that this is salty no i mean salty ! will try something else for my son annie please make these less salty and i will try them again	8
0	too salty for me there is a better brand out there	8
0	this stuff tastes absolutely terrible ! steer clear and do n't be mislead by the texture review below yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately is n't worth it	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	they sounded good but are n't tart enough for my taste and are prepared with too much sugar	8
0	these dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit i was expecting a chewy tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead i will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal but i wo n't buy them again	8
0	i was very disappointed when i received the dried cherries i did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil when i opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries i had to rinse them in hot water before i could use them this information is not included anywhere in the description	8
0	in amazon 's ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i 'd avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards	8
0	i thought this would be a great tasting healthy snack after reading the reviews mine arrived safely and crunchy unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch however they were not sweet and tasty my sister described it as tasting like cardboard now i have 5 whole bags i do n't know what to do with maybe i 'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better if you can i 'd recommend try before you buy	8
0	do not buy crunchies products in the hot summer months they are heat sensitive as the packaging states important store in cool dry area the two cases i purchased arrived chewy and clumped together they probably cooked during shipping and are not a raw food and not as nutritious anymore two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened amazon com does not accept grocery returns it was a waste of 40	8
0	i bought two flavors of gloria jeans k cups i loved the price the coffee is good but i hate getting grounds in my coffee ! i 've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds under the filter so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup about a 1 2 teaspoon per cup lower price poorer manufacturing standards	8
0	why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars \? they would have been great without the coconut and now i find out i ca n't return them and i'm stuck with them if you want them let me know i 'll trade you for some decent granola bars	8
0	not my favorite of their products the rasins are hard and sometimes burnt it takes to long to soften	8
0	i ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar the cherries were gritty \( dirty \? sand \? \) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries now i'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat	8
0	it is a quick meal when you need it but hopefully you wo n't need it too often i guess you ca n't expect too much from a two minute meal but it would be nice if you could expect more than this it is an easy kosher meal when you do n't have a kosher microwave	8
0	i purchased these candies hoping for a good tasting soft licorice candy ummm no on both accounts taste was miles away from any of the licorices ive had and these things were hard as rock oh well at least i tried them	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8
1	if you dont like mangos you will not like this drink it does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener this does mix pretty well with cold rum i would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it this water does not taste like the water you would get from the asian countries i cant really explain why either	8
1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	this is the best snack bar we have tried it has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar we have tried a few of their flavors and this and rasberry chocolate are our favorites	8
1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	8
1	i received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola it 's a healthy snack that 's great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals	8
1	absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you low fat high fiber a delicious alternative to the bland tasteless granolas produced by the major american cereal makers i 've tried virtually all of the back to nature products and each and every one is sensational do yourself a favor and try this product highly recommended	8
1	back to nature apple strawberry granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack each flavor of the back to nature granola is tasty i would be careful before ordering this product in bulk my order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on september 15th i did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had i known this as this is a food product it is not eligible for return so while this is an excellent product i would not recommend ordering this from amazon grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire	8
1	i have been using the navitas natural organic raw cacao nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness well being and energy for the day we add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning i do n't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples however i can tolerate the nibs	8
1	these nibs are great on ice cream or with cool whip not good alone but paired with a sweet they are great i am going to try cookies next week ! i have already bought more	8
1	you have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you it is very good for the body i tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause good stuff	8
1	these little nibs are very bitter i would n't recomend poppin them straight from the bag they were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner dip with chunked fruit lay on tray covered with wax paper and refridgerate for 20 min the chocolate hardens raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works ! also very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate this is a great product for experimental food people straight out of the bag disappointing	8
1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	8
1	these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself i was very pleased with this purchase	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8

1	this product is great ! very refreshing it tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut it does n't have any added sugar it 's only 60 calories a serving i just wish it were cheaper	8
1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8

1	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
1	bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast 's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat	8
1	bear naked granola is just fabulous i 've tried every granola around and bear naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you and amazon 's price certainly beats what you 'd pay at the store	8
1	good low sodium low sugar granola that i feel i ca n't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues	8
1	i hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man 's meat is another man 's poison i like the not too sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand the banana flavour is our favourite the fruit and nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds \( so maybe too minimally processed \? \) also remember that 'all natural' is not organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store our local target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it	8
1	we love this granola ! bear naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola we love eating the banana flavor by the handfuls and the peak protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt amazon sells it for a great price too	8
1	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	8
1	these individually wrapped slim jims make great snacks for hungry kids toss a few in your purse and you have a portable filling treat while you 're out with the kids my kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy	8
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	8

1	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
1	i personally like the taste of this product but i can see that others may not the taste is unusual with natural tones i definitely like the packaging standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time but a box of zico survived a 2 week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine	8
1	this is the best snack bar we have tried it has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar we have tried a few of their flavors and this and rasberry chocolate are our favorites	8
1	my husband and i have been off sugar for several years we thoroughly enjoyed these spirulina bars sure they are green yet that is the color of spirulina my husband has passed these bars out to a neighbor and our chiropractor and they love the bar also my husband travels alot from work site to work site and this spirulina bar helps him with his hunger pain in a nutritious way	8
1	i 've been wanting to try spirulina the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so the bar is a medium sized green rectangle it smells interesting and is very moist and chewy i'm not a big fan of sour foods so i did n't like that it tasted a bit sour my brother however loved this bar more than all the others we tried has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats very filling ! overall if you like sour and sweet this bar is for you	8
1	this granola is great tasting and healthy other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not apple blueberry is my family 's favorite flavor	8
1	could n't find this item in any stores in my town so i went to amazon \( naturally \) and found it ! the item was delivered on time too ! thanks amazon	8
1	these were exactly what i wanted and tasted great in my home made mint cocoa nib ice cream where the bitterness did n't turn you off from the product	8
1	my kids love these snacks and now they are in a handy bag for school snacks it makes me feel good that i 've sent my children off with a healthy snack will buy them again good price	8
1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	8
1	my daughter is addicted to chedder bunnies ! lol ! ! which is fine because they are not made with any hydrogenated oils ! they are her favorite snack and she asks for them everyday ! we are always stocked with a box or two ! \)	8
1	just the right size snack pack for my 17 month old healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste	8
1	these are just delicious and i like having the controlled portions in the bags a very satisfying snack for 150 calories	8
1	these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself i was very pleased with this purchase	8

1	so good i love bear naked i think the fruit and nut is the best out of their varieties	8
1	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	8

1	i have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money although this is n't a full size slim jim but rather a shorter one it 's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up slim jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you wo n't go wrong with the 100 count box	8
1	my whole family love these crackers it 's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils the only thing i wish is that they were whole grain !	8
1	all 4 of mine love these they are great for a quick snack on the go or to pack in lunches when in a hurry	8
1	these crackers are great for the natural health conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers they taste great and are all natural with organic wheat nothing weird you can actually understand what every ingredient is ! \( how refreshing \) plus i love this new big box 12 oz instead of regular 7 5 oz not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it 's a better price per ounce ! great for us because we go through them so fast now that these are available here i also do n't have to go to the store \( some of my local stores do n't carry the big size anyway \)	8
1	the only way i drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories !	8
1	i love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon com i first found them in reading pa and here in florida could not find them high fiber is important to me and these have more than most	8
1	these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price do n't worry about buying too many with the six pack i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor	8
1	i am a south beach diet follower and these crackers are a perfect choice to fit the guidelines of the diet and they are delicious ! they are quite expensive in stores so i'm very excited to see amazon offering them at such a great price	8
1	i'm a vegetarian and although my husband is n't he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you 're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you 've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets amazon sells it for 2 66 a box substantial savings	8
1	what could be better than this just read the label of what is in it and check your fridge do you have the items to make it in about a minute	8
1	we spent 5 years in brasil and senseo has captured the essence of the premium cafe taste from some of the better fazendas ! well done particularly for a dutch company	8
1	i am enjoying my senseo even more with the addition of the new varities i like the brazil blend as well as the sumatra	8
1	i find this coffee to be very rich in flavor yest strong enough for my taste	8
1	if you like strong coffess go with this its wonderful ! definitely worth it	8
1	ca n't rave about this enough if you like sardines this is the way to go just plain delicious	8
1	my wife and i have slightly different tasates in coffee i like mine darker and she like a milder coffee this one however is just right for both of us i drink it daily without cream or sugar \( which i only do when i actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee \) and we are on our second 5 pound bag ! i wish we had found this coffee sooner it is great	8
1	for anyone who needs a shelf stable quick lunch option this is the one ! the soup is delicious and the prep could n't be easier plus i love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl i always make sure i have a few of these in my desk drawer at work so i never have an i forgot my lunch issue and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal \( for lunch anyway \) i love the udon flavor and my husband swears by the miso	8
1	authenic but a little bland for me i add ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really hot in the micriwave if steaming when you take it out it tastes better pre rinsing the noodles \( as directed \) is nonsense just cover them with good clean water \( i never use tap \) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds uncovered stir and serve it had everyone in my office drooling with questions ! best price is on amazon just order 2 so you do n't pay shipping	8
1	i 've tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious ! this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long ! it is moderately spicy but if you do n't mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up i could practically live off of this stuff ! thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating	8
1	this annie chun 's udon soup is very easy to prepare i do n't think the first step is necessary either just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes add the sauce packet the noodles loosen up after you stir it if you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables my kids and i really love this soup ! i just purchased more from amazon because it 's a better buy here than at the grocery store	8
1	i have purchased this item several times it is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken it comes packaged well and is easy to prepare it is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me	8
1	i moved from northern california to the ozark mountains of northern arkansas i can get starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive gourmet coffees but that 's about it i have been on the lookout for robust full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices i tried pete 's espresso blend and liked it but it was n't available the last time i checked so i tried this fogbuster and i like it even more good thing since it comes in a 5 lb bag if you like starbucks french roast this compares quite favorably	8
1	first found this concentrate a few years ago in kroger and took it camping because of its small size small size big on flavor and not too salty was glad to find it online as i ca n't get it in stores nearby anymore	8
1	amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac cheese is great we ca n't get our five year old to stop eating it price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store	8
1	these cheese sticks are irresistible in fact for a substitute they taste far better than the original my kids love them and 1 ounce pack fits perfectly into a lunchbox	8
1	check the company 's website they select cook their tuna differently and that 's what makes their tuna the best it has the lowest possible mercury \( same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna \) plus they cook it only once after it 's canned so all the healthy vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids are still there in the can ! plus amazon has it for a great price	8
1	this is just what i 've been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general the flavor of the meat is not masked by salt yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands great stuff ! four stars only because it is 3 75 per can	8
1	i bought this jerky at a xmas lot a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it this year they were sold out but i was lucky to find it on amazon even less expensive ! this is the best you can find the ones in the market to do not even compare believe me it does not last long in our house ! would definetly recommend the original and other flavors they are all great	8
1	my packaged arrived much quicker than i had anticipated since living in the midwest the last 5 yrs i 've had limited access to beef jerky i accidentally ran into 'oberto' beef jerky which was fine just extremely salty and overly seasoned world kitchens beef jerky tasted very natural and delicious i purchased it based on reviews and cravings and i would definitely purchase again superb beef quality texture and flavor thank you	8
1	i do n't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price my wife and two kids also find it to be delicious	8
1	ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews i am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product i will buy again my kids love the stuff not a bad snack	8
1	better beef jerky is not to be found anywhere shipping was good and it made alot of people happy at christmas time	8
1	i 've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie to get height i whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks they 've turned out great and you ca n't tell it 's gluten free i 've had less luck making biscuits out of it came out hard but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten free flour mix	8
1	they were thick like bisquick biscuits they tasted great would be wonderful in chicken dumplings the only thing i did wrong when making them was using bob 's red mill sall purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in it made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans yuck ! i used white rice flour and they tasted great \) for a buttery flavor put butter \( or if you are gfcf a non casien containing margarine spread \) on the top for a taste similar to kfc taste great with jelly in the middle too \) i froze the unbaked left over biscuits and they turned out well 2 months later	8
1	easy convenient and tasty snack or breakfast particularly good for college students	8
1	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
1	my spouse is on south beach diet and loves these i portion them out in ziplock bags \( 15 nuts each \) and they are grab and go lots of protein some fat and very little carbs fresh and tasty	8
1	these are good nuts very lightly salted just the way we like them but they are almost all almonds a little disappointed with that i was hoping they would be an equal mix of all the three variety of nuts	8
1	these are just wonderful when you want something quick for dinner just add chicken beef or seafood and any bottled sauce you like my favorite is alfredo sauce and some mushrooms family loves it	8
1	i tried this coffee on a whim my husband and i really enjoy our single serve coffee maker we easily use up an 18 pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us this coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor it is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily	8
1	love bob s red mill organic golden flaxseed and will purchuse it again it is one of the best product on the market in my opinion i use flaxseed every day i start my morning with a oatmeal flax seed muffen that i came up with i also use it in a lot of my recipies good product thanks bob 's red mill	8
1	i was going to just put this on my cereal in the morning now i add it to my protein shake suppliments and i 've started cooking with it by using it as a breading for fish chicken or pretty much anything it 's fantastic ! i'm going to end up ordering more soon	8
1	for people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up these peanut butter balls are a godsend many 's the time i 've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things i always carry one in my pocket or purse and keep one in the glove compartment	8
1	this snack is superb in several ways first it is very good tasting the flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates \( or sugars \) and is high in fiber i carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine these would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip	8
1	faster than expected shipping ! great tasting product and good for you too	8
1	wow this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label warning highly addictive hands down the best beef jerky we 've ever eaten moist yet chewy very satisfying not too salty lots of flavor think maybe i 'll go eat some now	8
1	although i was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible we had purchased this salmon jerky at trader joe 's in smaller packets and really liked it so we decided to purchase here at amazon much less expensively yes this product is very dry but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there my family liked it and we are placing a second order that other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way	8
1	serves well as an in between meals snack got a good deal on amazon	8
1	even though i know it 's important to eat breakfast i seldom do it i 'd rather sleep a little longer these breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem i keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning they 're whole grain nice and filling and taste good to boot they 're also a nice treat on the way home the oats and honey are my favorite but the variety pack provides a nice change all of the flavors are tasty peanut butter cinnamon maple sugar all yummy	8
1	excellent green decaf tea at a great price we love this tea it has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too by comparison many other green teas are too dry tasting for me and i like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea its great hot and good iced too	8
1	add mayonaise to anything and i love it that is espcially true of this white albacore tuna being packed in water lowers the calories and it 's fat free but it needs something to moisten it like mayo it 's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad the tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in mercury content plus there is nothing added to the product so it 's truly all natural i happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy	8
1	i love eating a lot of cereal in the morning like anybody i really do n't choose a cereal that is just good for you i really choose it for taste i loved special k before when it was plain flakes but i absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries this cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries i like how delightful the strawberries taste after i add the milk into the cereal this is a great buy for anybody who loves special k cereal or for anyone who just has n't considered that special challenge price b taste a overal b	8
1	for a working mom these are the best quick easy heck my four year old can make them ! price wise \? i'm a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for 1 a bag amazon offers them for less the garlic cheddar biscuits btw are the closest things i 've found to the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits and so easy	8
1	i did receive the splenda flavor packs and enjoy them alot	8
1	tastes great less calories amazon 's pricing is cheaper than my local grocery store so i stocked up	8
1	of the several brands of agave nectar that i have tried this one is by far the best it has the least taste to it it is just sweet \( very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water \)	8
1	i 've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index this product is the best and it tastes wonderful my kids do n't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes highly recommend	8
1	works great in coffee and tea and can be used in baking as well	8
1	there is one other cereal on the market that is very similar incrunchy tasteful cereal ! ! i had both in my pantry and tried each independently and then together this the one cereal that is good on any outing for breakfast with milk can of cream orjust plain water on a camping outing outfit your backpack withhealthy goodies no spoilage either i was hiking for four days with kashi dried fruit several cans of juices it is just the best approach for hiking with the minnimum lager on board	8
1	always soft and semi sweet real apples tastes kinda like a muffin without any air in i	8
1	very good tea weak but nice aroma mild good flavor excellect for the price	8
1	i got into various oolong teas from a great new york importer they really know their teas ! but this year the numi ti kuan yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer i dunno maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing but we 've been enjoying this tea ! you can spend 3 times as much and get better tea but then it 's too expensive to drink every day buy this	8
1	i ordered both the brown sugar jerky and the peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic this jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew the flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat i am on my second 2lb order i am totally hooked	8
1	this is truly great jerky and a fantastic price do n't let the price fool you this is first class jerky i order for the whole office and every person raves my last order was for 36 bags of world kitchens \( some of all 5 flavors \)	8
1	a great product at a very good price we are repeat customers so that says it all	8
1	this is one of the best beef jerkys i have purchased moist tender with a great flavor i have tried the others that are like orginial dry and tough to chew leaves your jaws tired also a great price best i have found will order agai	8
1	after all the great reviews we did n't think we could go wrong these are really good but not as satisfying as maybe a protein bar then again did n't really expect them to be	8
1	my 2 1 2 year old is allergic to foods very common in traditional granola type bars wheat soy nuts we have tried various bars that were safe for her to eat and this has been by far her favorite ! i'm happy that they 're organic she loves the taste great all around they are individually packaged which makes them great for when we are on the go	8
1	these are very tasty not too sweet like some bars but plenty sweet enough nice fruity flavor my favorite of the three envirokidz bars even if i did n't need to eat gluten free these would be a favorite snack	8
1	what else do i need say for coffee for my favorite coffee maker the only thing else i need is some latt	8
1	i love the flavor it 's in a world of it 's own it has great taste and textur	8
1	the wife looked incredulous but i had the last laugh as i pasted a beefy juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while thank you world kitchens for two pounds of steer delight	8
1	this jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten i buy it every year as christmas gifts \( and ofcourse save one pkg for us \) and everyone raves about it my family always looks forward to christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays you ca n't beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful the brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness i would highly recommend this product value and quality ca n't be beat a thanks !	8
1	this is quality jerky probably the best i have found so far	8
1	awesome jerky some pieces are tender some are tough had to knock off a star for the gas i can clear a stadium after eating a few pieces of this stuff	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
1	everyone in my family \( from 3 to 64 years old \) loves these organic cookies i purchased these cookies at several local stores before i discovered that amazon had them i sent a package to my grandson who is in the army in iraq and he raved about them newman 's has another big winner !	8
1	i do not like store bought cookies especially oreos \( too dry and greasy for me \) but upon the recommendation of several people i tried the ginger o 's and was pleasantly surprised they have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it if you like ginger cookies do n't hesitate to try these	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	i love the original vanilla creme newman 's o 's so when i saw the wheat free dairy free on sale one day i picked one up i figured it would basically be the same as the original the chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but i found the cookies themselves to be rock hard so unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products i would recommend the original vanilla creme and not the wheat free dairy free variety	8
1	fresh tuna great price i would recommend this product	8
1	my order arrived before i could blink ! i am buying my coffee here from now on	8
1	the variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee i 've had in a long time i drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one i look forward to the most is the cup i make in the morning on my senseo machine the origins pods are the best of the best these pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available get the variety pack and try them all they are all wonderful	8
1	we first bought these crackers in a local store and loved them nutritionwise they are really good and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy never attempt a conversation while partaking you 'll never hear the other person \) after our first purchase we bought directly from dr kracker then they told us of the great deal we 'd get buying them thru amazon and that 's what we 've been doing ever since aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter then we 'll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time	8
1	i saw this bread in my local health food store and it looked so good i decided to try it i must say it taste just as good as it looks this is by far the besting tasting cracker i 've ever tasted made completely from certified organic ingrediants this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious and the price here at amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer i'm looking forward to this replacing the breads i usually use	8
1	i tried this about two months ago and really loved it i love the crunch and natural sweetness i also made corn chowder with their corn product i recommend this for any one who loves healthy natural snacks	8
1	this is a very tasty nutritious snack ! no fat sweet crunchy a great alternative to running out to the vending machine at work	8
1	i really enjoy these as a light snack they are only 85 calories a bag so it is easy to fit it in your diet	8
1	when i searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand was n't so good granted i am not an avid coffee drinker however i really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that wo n't burn a hole in my stomach i usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup if anything needs a little more of the flavor \( i e hazlenut vanilla \) added to it but still very good	8
1	these pods are excellent ! same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price	8
1	this is great granola and at such a great price ! i usually make my own but for this price it 's not worth the effort ! thanks for the great value	8
1	good quality granola not too sweet would give it 5 stars but it does n't have enough nuts super nutty it is not it is worth the price though my wife would give it 4 5 stars she is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat	8
1	the munch'ems were certainly a good buy they taste great and easy to pack best of all they are good for you too	8
1	these were very good cookies i loved the texture and flavor a nice surprise from a packaged cookie i would buy again	8
1	i had purchased a few of the tea chests as christmas gifts for my neighbors i thought it was so beautifully made that i purchased another for myself ! the wood chest is really pretty and the tea variety inside is great i put it out every time i entertain	8
1	very nice wooden tea box will make a nice present i have not tried the teas though	8
1	dr krackers are fantastic they are different from any other cracker i have tried they are very crispy which is what i love about them they are delicious plain or with cheese and dips because of their crispiness they hold up great for dips i cannot say enough about these crackers they come in several flavors while classic 3 seed is my favorite they are all very good	8
1	best snack i 've found in years i keep these in my desk at work for a mid afternoon appetite curb highly recommended by all my family and friends	8
1	i am addicted to these they are delicious not dry at all and there are lots of crackers in each container yum !	8
1	this coffe is so delicious ! it is bold and smooth there 's no bitter taste even when brewed strong if you 're looking for a great coffee with a smooth flavor and nothing bitter you' wo n't be dissappointed with timithy 's colombian la vereda	8
1	i use k cups all the time at work at home etc there are a handful of good k cup brands out there this is one of the best both decaf and regular timothy 's columbian are smooth and rich in flavor add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee ! ! you wo n't be disappointed believe it or not the home brewing k cup machine \( keurig \) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial k cup machine \( also keurig \) because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it fyi	8
1	we love the taste of illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter and the vacuum packed canister has a unique reusable design	8
1	i have tried everything for our francis francis espresso machine and had an extremely difficult time to make it taste wonderful i found this espresso and the first time i tried it i was absolutely hooked try it you 'll love it !	8
1	illy rules my favorite espresso roast great price excellent	8
1	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
1	the south korean oysters are the only ones i will eat nice size tender flavorful avoid any from china	8
1	i 've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil which is vile to say the least the crown prince oysters are packed in olive oil a huge step up in health and taste they are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch etc they taste wonderful added to soup or stew great for last minute entertaining last but not least i like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies	8
1	so these are basically ritz bits but with three differences 1 the crackers are better they taste more buttery and flavorful 2 the cheese is better it actually tastes like something that 's met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand 3 they 're all organic 'n' stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to big food if you 're packing lunches for kids \( or snacks for yourself \) these are great	8
1	some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread it substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading \( it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long we knead bread about three minutes \) spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes it seems easier to digest it does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten sensitive this is probably not an alternative	8
1	we love cinna raisin crunch for breakfast the clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk the cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours if you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you	8
1	these prunes are delicious to eat ! since we started eating newmans organic prunes the store bought ones do not compare we notice a difference and feel healthier for eating these amazon is a place to shop in which we feel good buying organic products from them thanks amazon !	8
1	these 6 oz packs of organic california prunes have more flavor than the non organic brands they are also drier and firmer which i was n't sure i liked at first i quickly grew used to it and now i prefer them this way they are sweet and chewy the freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have you ca n't go wrong at this price for 12 bags this is one brand you can trust	8
1	very tasty coffee cake probably does n't cost much more than to buy all the ingredients to make it and easier ! ! ! nice weekend treat ! make sure there 's lots of people around to eat it so you do n't eat it all yourself !	8
1	read about panko in several cookbooks this was definitely the best buy out there although i have enough to last me several years ! would recommend this product	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
1	these are not that cheddary i imagine that this is what the dried congealed waste water from making cheddar tastes like it 's good enough	8
1	it 's really taste good and let you feel good too it 's a easy way to get calcium only concern is the price is little expensive and ca n't affort to have it often	8
1	really great irish brown bread tastes just like the bread in ireland ! very easy to make i make it 3 times a week \( my husband is irish ! \)	8
1	this is my favorite side dish it is so versatile and so very easy to make it tastes great with any and every kind of sausage i 've ever tried i love to make it when i whip up a batch of hot wings	8
1	i find it easy to use at breakfast when added to my muesli honey and yogurt mix powerful healthy morning treat for the price you ca n't beat it as a health food	8
1	i got a few packages of these used some for my daughter \( for the omega 3 fatty acids as they help with brain function she is speech impaired \) and for my grandpa \( who has high blood pressure had a stroke \) you simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal my grandpa 's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month \( none of his medication had been able to do that \) my 5 y o daughter did n't notice this in her oatmeal i tried it and there is no added taste just health benefits \) great product we always have it at our house	8
1	this is awesome soup ! ! i was a little iffy about it \( about any soup coming from a can or bag ! \) but ordered it anyway it sounded so good my hubby toddler and i love it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it ! we took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with and everyone agreed how great it was not as good as home made but really really good ! i'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star but we all thought it was worth getting again !	8
1	these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks breakfast foods they 're nice and sweet wo n't fall apart on you like granola bars yet do n't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it 's the perfect consistancy a great way to get some portable protien if you do n't want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you	8
1	i have a briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot i have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema enjoy	8
1	the espresso pod is easy to use easy to clean and makes very good espresso i am very happy with it and just ordered another box	8
1	about to order my fourth box this year it makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt	8
1	we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes i like how easy they are to use no mess no tamping i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily	8
1	i use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats yum	8
1	it evens says snap crackle pop not only is it delicious but it is very filling it satisfies my urge to crunch and eliminates my problem with gluten products i highly recommend this cereal	8
1	my favorite things are often the most simple a healthy alternative to kellog 's rice krispies with the benefits of organic ingredients rice syrup instead of cane sugar and an incredible company behind it all to boot and this tastes even better ! also rice syrup wo n't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy	8
1	these are the best ! they remind me of rice crispy treats they 're so chewy and delicious i recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products	8
1	if you love the taste of peanut butter then you will love the taste of these granola bars they are chewy and do not break into pieces while eating them a healthy delicious and quick snack	8
1	i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands	8
1	they went over well in our house the sugar content is semi low and the peanut butter has good protein	8
1	delicious and very filling they can easily be used as a meal replacement	8
1	we have been using meyenberg 's powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat 's milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk	8
1	i started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow 's milk that well this product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow 's milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow 's milk is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go i do n't have to worry about it spoiling i just mix and give it to my daughter	8
1	i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born i supplement the mother 's food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food the pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both	8
1	i use these beans in a jura capresso superautomatic everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try also has excellent crema	8
1	the roast is more smooth and mellow than starbucks i prefer it to illy produces ample crema it 's a good value after trying the first bag i ordered several more the lavazza has become my daily espresso bean at least until the 8 8 pounds runs out ! fwiw i grind with a rancilio rocky burr grinder and my espresso machine is a rancilio miss silvia	8
1	this is a terrific espresso i got hooked on lavazza in italy and have n't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it 's throne this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i 'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor would highly recommend !	8
1	great taste ! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste the reason why your \( to the previous reviewer \) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine if you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer these are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees	8
1	i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink very easy	8
1	lots of bang for your buck if you are a discerning hostess who enjoys offering guests a slightly off beat non alcoholic beverage really like the packaging like the taste too kind of like mountain dew with ginseng	8
1	i will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo	8
1	this is my favorite of essn 's juices it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails also a huge hit with kids ca n't beat 100 juice worth every penny	8
1	i did n't know tuna could taste this good ! and low mercury relieves worry about eating too much fish i love shopping amazon i experiment a lot and am never unhappy but this tuna is really wonderful	8
1	this was the first time i have bought this and am very pleased with it when you open the can the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands it tastes pretty good too will buy again	8
1	i thought tuna in olive oil tasted good but this is better this is the tuna for salad nicoise maybe use the other for mixing tuna salad	8
1	am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet the pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good even dh with incredible sweet tooth liked it	8
1	this is the same crystal light lemonade that comes in the round containersbut with the quanity buy much cheaper great taste	8
1	i discovered this in our local qfc grocery store which is the only place i 've ever seen it and amazon 's price is much better as i paid 8 for one package growing up my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food i call this whole wheat orzo my adult pastina \) cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful i highly recommend it	8
1	i 'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile and it 's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores this is a very great pasta at a reasonable price i 've been very pleased with this pasta	8
1	this is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy	8
1	while i like all of the kashi products i 've tried this one has to be my favorite ! with a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get \? great taste with seven grains and sesame ! perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box	8
1	the pods are great they taste great and brew great coffee although in my two different pod machines they brew coffee that tastes very different the one thing to be aware of is that the pods are slightly thicker than many other brands and they may not fit right in some machines the problem only occured with the double pod configuration for a bigger cup of coffee	8
1	this coffee rivals the name brand coffee house and right in my own kitchen i am the only coffee drinker in my home so i make one or two cups each morning and the no muss no fuss delivery of this system is unbeatable if guests want a cup of coffee i am not brewing a pot just a cup as needed	8
1	great flavor light and fluffy and good texture only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches unlike other gluten free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle	8
1	i ordered this for the mocha flavor but really cannot say that i found it i will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee so much so that although i ordered this for after dinner coffee i have been making it for breakfast	8
1	mocha java is one of the smoothest cups you will ever have with a full bodied taste it is so mellow it is almost buttery i love it	8
1	mocha java is almost as good as going to starbucks for a cup of coffee i recommend it to anyone who likes the mocha flavor of coffee	8
1	we have a new keurig coffee maker and just love timothy 's coffees any flavor but especially the german chocolate great price too	8
1	my family all enjoys this product the taste is good very little aftertaste the product is healthy and excellent for a quick snack	8
1	the title pretty much sums it up \) not too sweet and just absolutely delicious every time i have a different cereal i wish i was eating this instead i do n't even know why i bother with the other kinds now that i 've found this stuff and it 's good for you too ! can life get any better \? i submit that it cannot ! \)	8
1	this is the best blueberry cereal i 've tried not sickeningly sweet excellent flavor and texture stays crunchy even mixed with yogurt	8
1	this is a great crystal light product i like that you get vitamin c from it it is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories tastes good too	8
1	the coffee was very good i just wish they had more items to select in the variety pack i'm still looking for that one flavor that says this is it i had a superb coffee in a local restaraunt and i 've been trying to duplicate that taste for a couple of years now	8
1	we have served this coffee at our sunday morning church services for 8 years it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from pura vida but helping children and families i heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say i knew i would get a great cup of coffee this morning ! we love this coffee	8
1	though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer 's cookie aisle these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt free	8
1	i have ordered these twice now they taste so good ! i also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked	8
1	newman 's own organics alphabet cookies are very chocolatey and very crunchy the first time i tried them i was hooked ! my two children also think they are fantastic if you are have not tried organic cookies before these cookies are a good starting point	8
1	this coffee has a rich bold flavor dark color and nice aroma very enjoyable drinking ! comparable with starbucks bold coffees	8
1	forget the white tea at starbucks clipper is the real deal ! quick to make requires just 30 seconds to steep i do it with non dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar but this is pretty sweet by itself but bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here or get them for pretty much the same price at whole foods	8
1	i bought one box of this and my entire family tried it it has since become a staple in each of our three homes great taste with or without sugar	8
1	pros very tastynatural \( no preservatives \) cons difficult to che	8
1	i love these ! the only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies ! i'm hooked i love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate and for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good	8
1	these are quite good tasting ! even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also did n't have to be bought 'in bulk ' but overall they 're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings	8
1	i tried betty lou 's spirulina ginseng balls because i read the nutritioninformation and you get 40 of your daily requirement for vitamin a inone serving at this point in my quest to eat healthier i 've read lotsand lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack israre finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare if you 're looking for a yummy sugery snack thisis not for you ! if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out	8
1	i ca n't believe how great these are i bought these about 9 months ago and they were going to expire so i decided to try one i feel amazing ! ! ! i had lots of extra energy without the side effects of caffeine it tasted pretty good	8
1	these are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you they are not based on grains but on greens instead taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you 'll love these plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day !	8
1	i tried this item just because it 's a a ginseng snack i found it to be not particularly tasty but the overall effect of increased stamina is true i'm not sure about spirulina in general but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days	8
1	i definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways there are just those who need the right filters melita knows that with their coffee filters they are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market they work great with 2 coffeemakers and especially are convient for those who 've purchased the individual ground coffeemaker melita 's perfect brew and perfect start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour and you will get a convient cup of coffee i really recommend melita a whole lot they are worth the price price b strength a overall b	8
1	some days after the kids leave the classroom i find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate ! not any more this is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours and there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies which i really appreciate they are maintaining their freshness well i bought them for the price but am now going to try the other items in betty lou 's kitchen	8
1	i have these and the worms i love them because they are soft i highly recommend them	8
1	i would buy this product from amazon anytime it has always been grea	8
1	i originally found these flatbread crackers while traveling after returning home i longed for them so amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads	8
1	this kracker is just the absolute best eating it alone when you need something crunchy or with healthy choice peanut butter or low fat cream cheese it just is an awesome product and i buy it in bulk cause i never want to be without it ! i 'd love to see a variety pack kind of a sampling of all the dr kracker goodies available	8
1	i bought these crackers because i love cheese and seeds nuts and am a low carb dieter they are very good and i would have given them 5 stars except i actually liked the crackers without the cheese better these are great for an occasional cruncy crispy treat and i would purchase them again they have a less sweet taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild not artificial or too salty i highly recommend them	8
1	i bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the senseo coffee pods i 've been buying i do n't have much to compare with but overall this decaff tases fine	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	everyone loved these pretzels very flavorful not too salty i plan on buying more from amazon best price i 've found on this brand	8
1	i was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most along with more protein i think they taste great	8
1	my daughters love this tasty pb natural snack typically in the stores around here one box is close to 5 but this bulk buy makes it about 2 70 a real bargain already one day they 've finished off one box	8
1	i happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them it 's too bad the cans are so small	8
1	i was really impressed by the taste of this cereal i was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this but instead it was really good it was sweet \( but not sugar sweet \) and crunchy i 'll definitely buy this again if the price went down i 'd buy it more	8
1	i love this cereal i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time i also snack on it dry it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk	8
1	my fav out of all nature 's path cereals and trust me i know nature 's path cereals calorie count perfect nutrition perfect everything is great about this	8
1	we initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores but they do not consistently stock it we enjoy the flavor the fact that it is made from organically grown grain and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber at the time of purchase we found the amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store we bought two cases !	8
1	this is an excellent quality product nice clean filets packed in olive oil instead of who knows what i really like having little glass jars instead of a tin that ca n't be reclosed if you do n't use all the filets at once my first food purchase from amazon was an excellent start	8
1	ever since i returned from spain i have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas these are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful if you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat i highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars	8
1	did n't expect much with the price being this low but it 's now a family favorite ca n't tell the difference between this and jeremiah 's kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes it 's one of our family favorites now	8
1	having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area ! it appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting lightly salted lower calorie popcorn but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film this popcorn pops fully leaving no kernels unpopped and does n't need any additives ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it ! thank you	8
1	great flavored soup that you do n't have to start from scratch very healthy choice	8
1	i am a firm believer in the health benefits of hemp this product is the best i 've found the delivery was very prompt and efficient	8
1	if you like hempseeds like i do this is your best buy amazon has the best price the seeds came fast fresh and are terrific to me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages the 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed i took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer i have a big bag in the refrigerator i toss these seeds all over my salads	8
1	i drink this stuff religiously it tastes great with very little bitterness coming through even when over steeped the yogi quotes are fun too	8
1	i am a huge fan of tea i have been drinking this one for years i am astonished at the price such a great deal anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase i love the subtle flavors of this tea i always feel better after drinking a cup it 's even better if you add a little fresh \( organic \) lemon juice	8
1	other than the republic of tea the people 's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract \( protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation \) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one 's daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day !	8
1	this is a nice smooth green tea actually i have tried many flavors of yogi tea and they are all lovely bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it and the women 's formulas help with hormonal issues i have not found a bad flavor	8
1	i just began baking with splenda when we found out my dad has pre diabetes for easter i prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with splenda and it worked beautifully everyone agreed that it did n't taste sugar free and my dad really enjoyed it	8
1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	i love splenda and i love getting it in a big bag as a good ole oklahoma girl i live for my iced tea and my tea must be sweet but sugar is n't an option so splenda to the rescue we use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my daddy has developed diabetes the big bags are often out at our local grocery store so finding them at amazon with our amazon prime takes care of that problem	8
1	i have found that splenda is a great sugar subsitute for a diabetic to use it is great alone on food and also for cooking with leaves no after taste like other sugar subsitutes do	8
1	there is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with splenda after couple tries i found excellent splenda recipes and even guests could not tell splenda cookies from sugar ones if you still feel splenda cookies are not the same add a teasp of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same	8
1	i'm a diabetic so i ca n't have sugar in my opinion splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it so if you 're a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks just sub some splenda in the recipe and you 'll be good to go	8
1	the glutino penne pasta actually tastes like the real thing ! i 've had a few bad experiences with rice pasta but this stuff is pretty good i do n't notice a major difference when microwaving leftovers so this deserves 5 star	8
1	you ca n't tell this is rice nooles it tast just like regular pasta ! ! my celiac husband loves it and he doens't feel like his missng out	8
1	these are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor they are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew this is the best licorice i have ever had bar none ! the bag is huge ! haribo really knows how to make candy	8
1	tellicherry pepper at this price is remarkable the product is excellent if a little difficult to pour from the large mouth into a small grinder otherwise great	8
1	agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufacturedsweeteners on the market today my only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use thanks e	8
1	this product is the best no aftertaste it 's organic and has a low glycemic value i use it in beverages it 's lighter than honey in this bottle it squirts out easily i seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness this is for the light easy storage and does not change consistency over time the regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness	8
1	since going on the candida diet i 've had to find sugar substitutes for most things and this agave has been a fantastic replacement we 've even used it instead of sugar in some baking and it 's worked out great	8
1	i like the nutiva hemp protein a great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber ca n't beat that ! it wo n't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can i like the taste and texture too mixes great with cranberry juice cranberries stevia ice and water ! i add some berry green for extra energy and nutrients ! it 's my morning breakfast	8
1	i 've been using nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful i add it to a smoothie in the morning and it keeps me going for hours it 's a staple in my diet so i usually have one or two jars on hand i highly recommend it	8
1	i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i could n't believe when i saw that there was 14 grams per serving considering that 90 of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions	8
1	i mix this with orange juice berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great it took some time to get used to the grainy texture but it is much better than soy or whey protein	8
1	we recently ordered a case of this cereal from amazon and are down to our last box now ! my husband and daughter have celiac and i do n't but i eat more of it than they do it 's really that good	8
1	my kids have tried i think all the gluten wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite they stay hard in milk and i an adult even like them	8
1	i love this cereal it is crunch and filling as well as great tasting was very upset when stores stopped carrying it so i was very happy that amazon carries it many of my friends buy this also	8
1	smart monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars they have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store ! well done to whomever came up with the recipe you are a smart monkey	8
1	rather mild but pleasant tasting coffee typically consistent brewing	8
1	thanks for carrying this coffee our local stores only carry the medium roast cappuccino it 's nice that you carry such a variety	8
1	i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee give it a try ! i will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs 18 in the regular bags	8
1	i am a coffee afficionado ! i'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans i can find i keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee ! this coffee was great and i have tried a million different brands ! ! ! organic and fair trade is important to me ! ! ! thanks for the extra effort ! i wish the big guys would make this kind of effort ! ! !	8
1	my husband 's favorite jerky used to buy single bag \( much higher price \) for special treat for him just wish he would not go through eight bags so quickly	8
1	these snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery the taste resembles that of cottage cheese a little under salted for my taste but still great watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape o mix you probably do not want to bite into those	8
1	i 've tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts \( even over frappacino \) i have to have one every afternoon for a 'pick me up' treat ! you will love this i'm on my 2nd case	8
1	if you need a boost its here ! ! tastes great and gives immediant energy ! i love it	8
1	i bought this tea chest for my father he loves it and it 's a good deal for the money it 's the perfect storage solution and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag too recommended	8
1	this cake mix is absolutely awesome very easy to prepare and is ohhh so good for those of us who have to avoid glutens in our diet sometimes baked goods just are n't at all tasty but this one is so good my husband who is not gluten sensitive eats it and says he ca n't tell any difference from the regular spice cake mixes will definitely be buying more of these	8
1	i have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door i received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week however the sell by date on each package is a week old they seem to be fresh enough now but i am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date it also makes me wonder about other amazon orders and the sell by dates on them i will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life	8
1	hazelnuts are tasty a 4 pack is twice as many as you 'd expect as part of a single package	8
1	great way to pass the day at work fresh and tasty	8
1	these are as good as the ones you buy in the store i was concerned about the quality but was happy to see that they are the same as those purchased locally great price with discounts most stores carry them for 1 99 for a 5 oz packet	8
1	in europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet a great source of omega 3 oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds they are good for the gut and good for the heart the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut brown seeds they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads they taste the same as the dark seeds ground they do n't show up in white bread so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber we like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt	8
1	this is a good price for this amount of quality licorice this is the traditional dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell not for everyone the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in america if you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain	8
1	double salt licorice is a very scary flavor for the uninitiated people do n't like it the first time then start to crave it if they stay with the taste if one does n't like this licorice it 's great to serve to unwanted guests	8
1	my kids like these just as much and i feel better giving them organic products \( the chemicals and pesticide herbicide residues in non organic foods make me nervous why take a chance when organics are n't that much more expensive anymore \? \) yes the cereal is n't artificially fortified with vitamins minerals but my kids get a high quality multi vitamin every day so there 's really no worry add a serving of fruit to increase the nutrition i also add a little protein powder to the milk since getting a protein boost in the morning is very important for sustained physical and mental energy	8
1	this is a wonderful \( and healthful \) snack crispy and tasty and low in calories each bag equals 1 2 cup of fresh fruit and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits there is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments i highly recommend these	8
1	it 's a great new \( at least for me \) crystal light flavor my husband loves it	8
1	i tried to order this here but was sent tang instead when i informed them of the problem they resent the order and again i got tang their system seems confused by the tangerine description or they 're just not very bright at the warehouse i 've had this flavor before and it is good not too sweet and a bit tart refreshing	8
1	the stores near my house charge over 2 a box for the organic type half of me thinks it 's great to have it avail on demand through amazon for cheaper the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house i think annie 's should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now it 's pretty dang popular oh well the alfredo variety is n't avail thru amazon right now anyway so i'm stuck \( again \) watching for sales and stocking up which makes the formerly ashamed half of me happy	8
1	i bought this for my wife who has many food allergies she cannot have wheat or items containg gluten this is one of the best products i have found its crunchy and tastes great it seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another this product has it all i even like it she absoultely loved it and i am out of the dog house for as long as it lasts	8
1	i have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try i am so glad i did this is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks	8
1	once i tried illy everything else tasted just ok truly an excellent coffee flavor smooth not bitter of overly strong and the price is lower than any store i 've check and even better than ordering directly from illy at a price of 13 per can i was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping i love that i only have to order two at a time and it 's delivered to my door !	8
1	these instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make a nice buttery flavor and all you need is water will be buying more	8
1	my kids love mashed potatoes these are sooo easy no melting butter just add hot water we love to have these as a midnight snack just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good would have given them 5 stars but they 're not quite as creamy as hoped	8
1	great product what else can i say \? while i lived in the caribbean i ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there	8
1	good texture good taste on the ahi tuna almost as good as beef jerky avoid the salmon jerky most of the strips were hard and brittle some were so tough they were barely edible more fit for my dog also the salmon was too spicy	8
1	i eat these right out of the package they are easy to put in my lunch box the flavor is great i never warm them up but they would probably be even better if you did i really like the sauce they are in no complaints i just like em great taste do n't take up much space but very filling highly recommend	8
1	and i 've tried quite a few i tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup and this one takes the crumpet ! the flavor is strong but mild the color golden brown and the aroma is light i threw out all the others \( or rather i gave them to my father in law who also like tea \) when i found this one and i bought a case of it	8
1	this is a great change from the canola oil and shortening ! ! when i first got it i pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious does n't add a lot of extra taste that you might think also think it 's not as stinky when frying as other oils then i had to try it on my popcorn oh that is really wonderful only problem i had is in delivery the oil was n't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid some of the liquid leaked out in the box just a warning if you live in a warm climate area	8
1	i wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as i think the 4 5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves however i think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the internet especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option i would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality	8
1	they give 1 of all profit off the top to charity and activism truly awesome company	8
1	love this great substitute for shortening keeps baked goods moister and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables	8
1	i first had these in alaska and when i returned my taste buds could n't stop thinking about them ! they are a great alternative to fast foods	8
1	these are really great they are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal a great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season	8
1	i love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal absolutely delicious	8
1	these are truly good gluten free cookies we have recently made the switch over to a casein free \( milk free \) gluten free diet for the sake of my son he is already a picky eater so i was worried about the transition these cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served \( ie in church school etc \) he is particularly enamored with them because they have kid friendly animal imprints being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces	8
1	we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes i like how easy they are to use no mess no tamping i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily	8
1	over the course of one day while at my work desk as other reviewers noted they are light buttery and delicious ! i'm using the second box for homemade \( sorta' \) ice crem sandwiches they are so tasty they really are fine plain now i wished i had ordered several cases when they were on sale for 12 but maybe then i 'd eat too many	8
1	these butter waffles are very tasty very light yet rich and buttery they 're hard to resist could n't help but eat a whole box only downside is that it uses vanillin rather than real vanilla however it goes great with ice cream and fruits	8
1	from where i should start ! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients do you know \? try it and tell me your opinion	8
1	this product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep before this i was taking harsh medicines like tylenol pm 's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before i went to bed ! not with the tea ! let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you	8
1	we 've enjoyed this sparkling meyer lemon juice enough that we 've reordered it we love the sparkling blood orange and cranberry juice combo but it 's nice to have some variety the meyer lemon flavor comes through very clearly and is quite refreshing we also like the light sparkling quality of the juice this juice makes an excellent mixer for drinks	8
1	i tried this drink with some friends and everybody loved it the meyer lemon is very distinct and has a great taste essn meyer lemon makes the best lemon drop ever i would highly recommend essn for your next event or party ! !	8
1	nice clean meyer lemon flavor these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon chefs love using these lemons in recipes this flavor also makes a great lemon drop	8
1	this is my favorite cereal ever since i started eating only organic i picked this up one day and i love it i eat it every morning for breakfast	8
1	makes an excellent cup of coffee with eye opening aroma and better yet profits from this fair trade company are invested in an orphanage in the community where the beans are grown so drink a whole pot	8
1	having tried senseo pods millstone etc i was surprised that good old folgers is just as good and in some cases better than senseo 's newer flavors while made for the home cafe these fit senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands	8
1	these are great and taste just like the real thing	8
1	never guess these are wheat free ! whole family loves them will continue to purchase	8
1	product arrived when it was supposed and exactly as in the ad i'm glad i ordered item	8
1	this kenya blend is a mild but very tasteful coffee no burned taste at all and it has become my favorite	8
1	good servive faor price this coffee could be a bit stronger to my tast	8
1	as with all newman 's own products you find great quality with what you 've purchased and also good value paul newman has given over 150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide since the establishing of the newman 's own line one box of these raisins is 130 calories with zero fat cholestrol it 's a good healthy snack to have around and enjoy from time to time	8
1	my kids love these lollipops ! so does my husband ! the flavors are great and they are the perfect size not too big and not too small they taste better than the other artificial ones you find at the grocery stores	8
1	these are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have because of my 2 year olds food allergies i discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them even the hospital my husband works at these are allergy free and amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	8
1	i 've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years this year for the first time i used turkey perfect and without a doubt this was the best moistest most flavorful turkey i 've ever done i told a friend about this product she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey even relatives who do n't really like turkey went back for seconds and thirds for the first time ever we had no turkey leftovers this year	8
1	this soup is delicious ! unfortunately it makes a bit much for one person but it is a good leftover very tasty	8
1	we really like these the lemon flavor is heavenly the cookies are crisp and light very very good	8
1	i was introduced to these when i bought a can at a big lots store and found that they were so good that i went on line and bought a case i highly recommend this brand to anyone liking sardines stan re	8
1	small no sugar a bit harsh tasting \( might end up better diluted a bit with club soda \) this is pretty well true of the four i have tried but in some ways the harsh tasting is good the 12 pack can be doled out at one per day per person does act as herbal medicine \? i have no idea but it 's very nice to have a treat that i do n't really want to consume all of in one sitting like for instance gummy bears	8
1	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	8
1	i love these things amazon is the only place i found to order these cheddar fries the 1 oz bag is the perfect snack size especially for those on ww each 1 oz bag is 3 points not bad for a junk food snack ! ! awesome price and fast delivery	8
1	this is a really delicious natural alternative to other frosted flake types of cereal and you cannot beat the amazon price	8
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	8
1	this is a good granola i like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things and a few nuts tossed in nice taste thanks to amazon for carrying so many gluten free items ! makes like so much easier ! !	8
1	this granola is delicious being that it 's gluten free is a bonus since it 's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet but my family can eat whatever they want and they could n't stop eating it ! the cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies this is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack	8
1	i feel better serving this mac cheese than all the others out there no artificial colors or flavors and it tastes great ! cheese sauce is on the salty side so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content	8
1	tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too not exceptionally great \( hence the 4 stars \) but good enough to enjoy eating big pieces of meat and plenty of it plus it 's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone fed cows which is also important in my oppinion would buy again	8
1	i loved the taste but the beef was quite dry it 's very easy to heat up and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal	8
1	if it were not for the fact that these nuts were not packaged properly they would be rated at least a 5 i called the manufacturer and they told me it must have been at the factory they were not full cans none were full to the top but two of the cans were not even half full the manufacturer sent me two coupons for the two cans that were about half full i felt the whole order should have been replaced but two cans is better than none as i said the product was excellent but i would not spend the money again to possibly get the quantity i got well all i can say is nuts to that gail napolitan	8
1	i love orange pineapple had these before getting more from amazon these are great as expected !	8
1	orange pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years when it 's out of stock at my local supermarket i go out and look for it it 's the best	8
1	the beautiful cobalt blue package contains deep dark shiny coffee beans that release a rich and robust flavor ideal for the real coffee lover the price ca n't be beat for organic coffee of this quality i will continue to buy it from amazon com	8
1	i had read other 's reviews about how great this coffee was but i was using another coffee that i thought was really wonderful i tried this one and now i am hooked it is wonderful if you like bold coffee which i do i also like the fact that it is organic i do n't drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two i have i want to be great just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	8
1	this coffee is awesome ! the aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me ! the price is great and the shipping is quick i am really glad to see that it is organic as well this sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust	8
1	none of that super sugared candied dried fruit or flat tasting candy e g chocolate chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack do n't get me wrong i love chocolate the darker the better but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing if i want candy i 'll buy the good stuff thanks amazon my local market no longer carries it	8
1	this has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt	8
1	i do n't normally review items but i had to write something on this because all of these it 's too salty comments are driving me crazy these are hardly salty at all there is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food my bag says its only 8 of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving i'm a man so i personally think these could use more salt	8
1	i used to love just corn but i like this brand even better i agree they could cut the salt a bit but i think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn	8
1	this is my new obsession i am a voracious snacker i love corn on the cob this tastes just like it only 70 calories per package i never thought i 'd be writing a review about corn but i like it i am going to try the other varities of this line	8
1	delicious and crunchy with a slightly sweet blueberry flavor healthy ingredients no added refined sugar and no wheat great product	8
1	these only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in not dry they taste great and i dont feel like i just ate fast food when i finish one of them or two	8
1	this annie chun 's udon soup is very easy to prepare i do n't think the first step is necessary either just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1 2 minutes add the sauce packet the noodles loosen up after you stir it if you what a more filling soup add meat vegetables my kids and i really love this soup ! i just purchased more from amazon because it 's a better buy here than at the grocery store	8
1	i started to love annie chun 's udon soup in march 2007 although it was on my amazon grocery list for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great i just ordered many a chun 's soup noodle bowls and i will order more again in future annie chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on amazon com	8
1	ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you 're on a diet \? that was a problem for me at least i 've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight well just when i 'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr kracker spelt muesli crackers ! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea ! highly recommended	8
1	was visiting my daughter and found these wonderful habit forming crunchy with a hint of sweet crackers i do n't want to eat anything else now ! hope i can get them where i live in ny soon	8
1	this is decent rice with a lemony herb flavor that is pleasant it 's a bit heavier than fresh cooked or frozen rice but works great in a rushed day	8
1	he did not know if he would but he loves them great for a quick snack or a snack to go please do n't quit selling these glad we bought them and will buy more	8
1	these are yummy vegan treats but they are kinda small for 120 calories and 4 5 grams of fat but they are a good snack	8
1	they taste so great i had to limit how many my kids could eat each day	8
1	just like all the other betty lou 's products i 've tried \( and become hooked on \) these are delicious individually wrapped they are a convenient and nutritious treat to take anywhere so good	8
1	even non celiac people should switch over here 's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes 2c water and 1 2c mix bring to gentle boil over high heat remove from heat immediately stir in 1 4c sour cream pour over meat browned in a skillet simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through turning and stirring often to prevent skorching hmmmm i'm getting hungry	8
1	i 've been gluten free for 5 years \( due to my son 1 1 2 personally \) i always had trouble duplicating my favorite casseroles because of them needing cream of mushroom soup concentrated with this mix i mix double the amount to the water so each container makes 3 instead of 6 and it tastes just as good as the gluten variety ! i have n't tried it as just a soup but it 's the only thing i 'll use in casseroles	8
1	i have used this cake mix many many times the first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday she said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer i have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though i am the only gluten free person i add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream yummy	8
1	this stuff is great and we ca n't find it in our grocery store in galveston co texas now i do n't have to wait until we fly to the northwest ! very cool	8
1	love this stuff great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well no after taste at all	8
1	these are great ! very smooth and yummy the only thing is i think they are a little to sweet for me i just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk then they 're perfect ! i 'll buy them again for sure	8
1	i am a big fan of coffee other than water it 's all i drink so when i found this i had to run with it it 's cheaper than red bull has more power than it it 's better for you than red bull and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste my frig is stocked with as i type !	8
1	both bags that i received were quite tender and had great flavor not too sweet and not too spicy i will definately be ordering some more my dog mr doodles also loves it	8
1	this was a very tender jerky it 's not the kind that wrenches at your teeth if you 're looking for hard core jerky look elsewhere back in my youth i used to love that sort of thing but with the sensitive teeth i have now i need to show a little discretion this jerky was great it was tasty it had a little heat which i appreciated the only drawback were the spice there 's something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion there 's 2 bags but it went fast it was that good	8
1	after reading that bentley 's has the finest ceylon teas in the world i decided to give this as a christmas gift to my husband he says it is the best tea he 's ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur i would consider that a compliment the box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation	8
1	this drink mix is really good it tastes just like other drink mixes but is only five calories it is definately a good choice they also have other flavors such as lemonade peach tea raspberry ice pink lemonade and more	8
1	this mac cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt very good product overall	8
1	this is real italian espresso the best you can find on the market if you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made rich flavor and sweet at the same time i 've known this product all my life growing in italy excellent the very best	8
1	i love the pod idea makes cleaning so much easier this is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner excellent	8
1	wow no wonder you ca n't get this anymore they probably ca n't make them fast enough this is such an unusual gift set the pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item the teas are all individually packaged and ones that you would n't find anywhere else makes you want to drink tea all day the box that it comes in \( as well as the individual tea box \) is reuseable and so pretty i hope that this item is offered for sale again soon as i would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts and maybe one for myself ! !	8
1	this is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea at more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at \( no offense to organic stores but a 200 mark up is a little much \) this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up	8
1	great for novelty gifts but do n't give it to true tea lovers ! ! ! different kinds of flowering tea look great very entertaining to watch bloom but taste pretty crummy i would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless nevertheless it 's a nice gift because of the experience and the cool box glass pot you get to keep	8
1	a great alternative to the junk filled mainstream variety i am hoping they come out with a regular flavor as well as the chocolate	8
1	when my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday my wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition making the right choices and responsibility each day the kids pack their own lunches from lunch box central each lunch must contain a protein \( usually yogurt \) a grain \( some form of cracker or grain filled bar \) and a fruit \( apple banana or fruit cup \) envirokidz organic crispy rice bars are a staple in lunch box central they 're convenient the kids enjoy them and they 're a reasonably healthy choice the kids are happy they 're learning and they 're eating well my wife is pretty smart	8
1	great taste and value ! it taste best with a high quality honey ! a must for tea drinkers	8
1	i love this popcorn and this was such a bargin price compared to store price thanks amazon ! ! !	8
1	i love this popcorn but ca n't find it locally thank goodness i found it online so i can still get it	8
1	it is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water buttered and salted to taste the smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house great summer smell all year long	8
1	this spread is way too good ! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone i like to eat it just straight out of the jar the spread is a perfect blend of flavors if you have a sweet tooth and do n't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us you have to order it at least once though !	8
1	very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack my kids really like them and while they are n't low calorie or really low fat it is n't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat the 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	8
1	i love the iced jasmine tea at our local vietnamese restaurant in fact every vietnamese restaurant seems to serve the same wonderful tea i have tried many different brands tyring to find one like the one served in vietnames restaurants light in color a light tea taste and a strong jasmine taste and scent i finally found my brand	8
1	i just bought some of this golden nut crunch from planter 's last week and i snack on it at work it is really one of the best trail mixes i have had before i love it it lasts a while also it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically i would definitely recommend this snack it 's healthy too	8
1	i love these bars ! i highly recommend these for a quick breakfast on the way to work	8
1	considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick i did n't find any grit in it it might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough this is a good deal	8
1	our family loves these balls they are very similar in taste and texture to the cheddar pirate booty maybe a little crunchier they 're by no means healthy for you but you feel a little less guilty no fake orange coloring etc	8
1	these cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box they taste like real butter and fresh ingredients and they just about melt in your mouth i 'll be buying these again	8
1	i 've tried the andy capp hot fries reg cheddar and white cheddar these hot fries are the best they 're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own ! i'm getting addicted to them \( ordered a second carton before finishing the first \) definitely nicely hot that 's part of the addictive quality and an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products	8
1	this seller shipping was very quick and the product was perfect ! i highly recommend this seller	8
1	my wife hates hot food but for some reason loves hot fries if her salsa has the tiniest spice she wo n't eat it yet these mouth burning beasts are her favorite snack they are sometimes hard to find having them by the case helps solve that problem the size offered here is the size that you will normally find \( around here at least \) printed with the 99c price so you can also figure the price savings somewhere around what 40 \? wow	8
1	pacific foods beef stew is wonderful for hot lunches at work inexpensively the all organic ingredients make the pacific foods very tasty and filling ! way to g	8
1	these things are so satisfying on many levels chewy crunchy sweet but not too just the right size with whey protein for energy which is the best source there is all that and organic peanut butter and organic agave syrup too i am so happy i have a whole tub of them	8
1	these peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you my daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life i have eaten these when i did not have time for lunch they are filling and energizing and taste delicious you ca n't ask for more than that !	8
1	let me count the ways they 're great for a quick energizing snack breakfast healthy dessert and tonight i even had one for dinner they are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they 're good for you ! plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball they 're very filling and only about 200 calories genius	8
1	high quality refined balance and intriguing flavor two thumbs up form people who like to cook	8
1	i thought this was great but it just was n't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon so delicious though when i make it for people they ca n't believe it 's a mix	8
1	this frosting is great ! it tastes good and has a wonderful consistency if you use room temp margerine and mix for a little longer than stated it actually tastes almost fluffy the vanilla is good but the chocolate is the best i 've every had hands down and i have no allergies ! this product is a easy and convient for those of us who have children with food allergies and all his friends enjoyed it at school	8
1	i thought these were amazing my favorite is the socorro blend a review said they were soggy but i'm not sure what they mean they are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit despite the fruit they are n't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning as for the price these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients the flavors are unusual but perfect i am defiantly going to order more	8
1	unusual and fresh tasting i really really enjoyed these nut blends i will definitely order them again	8
1	sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise they 're not over sweet nor over hot and they 've got a lot of flavor and texture over all i 'd say they 're among the best snacks you can buy not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they 're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves however the price is pretty high for the amount you get even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack it 's a little high however for the occasional treat it 's well worth the price it 's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies	8
1	i am ordering more of these goodies they are not only delicious and top quality they are the most interesting assortment i have ever had and are great for my sensitive stomach too ! very excellent price as well !	8
1	i'm placing my second order for the variety pack because i liked every flavor and appreciated the variety all have a sensational blend of flavors spicy sweet salty without being overpowering truly delicious and healthy munchables i'm so glad i decided to try out a package in my supermarket	8
1	what a deal ! great tasting treat at a good price ! i will definetly be ordering other flavors and killarney again too	8
1	arrived in 4 days best price i 've found flavorful coffee	8
1	if you are looking for a healthy high fiber cereal that tastes good and does n't have too much sugar this is it ! i love this stuff	8
1	the product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the optimum power which has blueberries in it it is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite	8
1	great nutrition profile for the calories involved the different textures make for a healthy organic snack	8
1	the back to nature graham sticks honey are delicious ! they are a great tasty snack there 's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk not because they 're rich but they 're a little on the dry side i still like them so much that i quit buying them at the supermarket started buying them in bulk	8
1	these are wonderful cookies ! however the reason i could n't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies the boxes were not damaged in any way so i am guessing they could have been packaged that way not cool ! otherwise they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion i 'll never go back to those	8
1	these cookies are great my kids love them i saved a bundle by ordering the case beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06 i did n't have any problems with the classic the expiration date was nov or dec i ca n't remember off hand	8
1	my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves we use it to make raw truffles \( sooo good \) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc we had no problems with shipments leaking so far	8
1	by far the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny	8
1	because of health problems i 've had to give up sugar the agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute i also use it with cereals and any other food or drink where i used to use sugar thank you blue agave	8
1	this is a great product for a mother of five it made my mornings and some snack times wonderful thanks	8
1	my kids and i love the variety of cereals this assorted package has comes with a bowl ready to eat in plus you can recycle the bowl	8
1	i bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away the kids loved the choices the only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old on average they ate two a day	8
1	this case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone but this is not for 2 people the cereal went stale before we could eat it but this would be great for a large family	8
1	i recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods staying away from hydrogenated oils corn syrup etc you know all the stuff that makes you fat \) this jerky is a great healthy lowfat snack ! ! it tastes so amazing you 'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again i love jerky and have tried many different brands this jerky is well worth every penny and i 'll keep coming back for more thanks amazon for making it affordable	8
1	this is the best frosting i have ever had and i do n't have food allergies i used it on the gluten free cherrybrook cupcakes and my son 's teacher pulled me aside to tell me how wonderful they were she also send people to me for the recipe i love all the cherrybrook products but this is my favorite	8
1	full flavored and smooth lingering winey aftertastes never bitter tolerates higher concentrations very well actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about 1 3 more by volume to get the same amount by weight as with pre ground coffees	8
1	these might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar they are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame flax and sunflower seeds i'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis i highly recommend oh i have ordered both from nutiva and from amazon amazon is less expensive and faster delivery	8
1	tastey and straong for a bag tea it really works as a sleep aid it does have ingredents that may aggravate sensitive people	8
1	i highly recomend this product to those who are able to use herbal treatments it helped me greatly in getting a more sound sleep	8
1	there are all kinds of things that i will eat for health 's sake but my husband is more taste oriented there are a lot of energy bars etc that he wo n't eat but he loves these	8
1	my family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of betty lou 's nut butter balls i do not have any problems at all with the taste in fact it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet yes they look green in the middle but we found the taste rather clean and refreshing not overbearing you will also enjoy the lift in your energy level these spirulina ginseng balls provide now that i know about these little guys i am getting ready to buy tons for christmas gifts ! we would not be without them anymore	8
1	this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal	8
1	we enjoyed this coffee however decaf may still contain some caffeine i was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters	8
1	this is an excellant product cooks up very well great with any sauces mac'n cheese and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad the price from amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very very expensive i just wish we did n't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem	8
1	nothing like this in the usual grocery stores splenda sweetened to help keep the calories down great texture and just plain good ! i want to try the other flavors soon	8
1	the cereal is delicious i put half of a banana in it it is fulling for me it is low in carbs and no sugar i am pre diabetic my sugar count is very good with this i will need them again soon	8
1	do n't think i'm weird but essentially the only thing i have at all to eat regardless of what time is nature 's path cereal the heritage collection is my favorite wholesome filling crunchy perfect	8
1	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
1	this is one of my favorite cereals ! it appears to be nutritionally superior to the heritage o 's and less crunchy the only downside to this cereal is that it does n't keep me full for long i feel like an hour later i'm hungry again i 've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power an upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack ! i have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne	8
1	i'm happy with the product and the swiftness of the delivery for sure i will be ordering again very soo	8
1	these are my most favorite of all the smart monkey bars and raw bars in general the best part is they are not dehydrated so they still have the live water content try to stay away from too much dehydrated food i'm an avid raw foodist i absolutely love these i can eat three in a row	8
1	it is hard to believe all you do is add water and then enjoy the best mustard	8
1	this is the best mustard i have ever had in my life ! prepared mustard you buy in the store does n't even come close to this mustard when you make it according to the directions on the container ! strong hint of horseradish caught me off guard at first but i love horseradish so this mustard is the best ! i will never buy prepared mustard from the staore again ! thank you	8
1	this is the best mac and cheese on the market just try it its rich and creamy and all organic and as healthy cheese and pasta can possibly be amazon also has a very reasonable price on this to stock your pantry	8
1	my son literally shakes with delight when i offer him this snack its also a healthy alternative to other fruit snacks out there so it keeps mom happy too	8
1	someone told me to look on amazon to locate this product it 's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees' the taste is out of this world and so easy to make i inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner thank you for having this product on amazon	8
1	to using bouillon cubes once you 've used and tasted this great product you 'll also wonder why you 've been taking pantry space for years with cartons and cans this is an amazingly simple and easy to use packaging concept \( no scissors no can opener \) for a first rate chicken broth with a really deep home made taste the beef version is excellent too	8
1	the only better broth i 've had was homemade by my hubby ! my daughter will even heat it for a quick snack i love it	8
1	i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i was n't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them	8
1	i'm french and i love these galettes they are the typical kind of cookies you can find in brittany \( bretagne \) with a light salted butter taste i like the tin too you can keep it to store whatever you like ! make a great gift to french cookies lovers	8
1	tasted ok better than the other pure bran thingsand great source of fibe	8
1	granted this is not one of the better tasting cereals but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2 3 cup the trade off is worthwhile if there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber i have n't found it just be aware that if you prefer sugary sweet cereals this definitely is not the one for you	8
1	this cereal is a wonderful \( better \) choice instead of the chex line of cereals it has more fiber organic ingredients and no bht excellent as both a cereal w milk and also when used as part of a homemade trail mix	8
1	this is a great cereal it is very similar to crispex only a whole lot better for you	8
1	we love this product in our house and it has helped me \( mom \) kick the diet soda habit i add my soluble fiber and other powdered supplements and i am on my way ! very true lemonade taste with no aftertaste at all	8
1	from where i should start ! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients do you know \? try it and tell me your opinion	8
1	i 've tried 15 20 different k cups and would rate timothy 's parisian night \( can you say french roast \) in the top third at the 7 25 oz setting it makes a full bodied dark brew with a nutty almost earthy taste it 's very much a european style blend and with a dash of half and half makes a passable viennese 'brauner	8
1	we love our keurig maching and this coffee is rich dark and delicious very smooth and strong yum	8
1	the crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared as well as the low calorie sweetened teas if you like it a bit sweeter put an extra pack of splenda in it	8
1	i tried a two lb pack and then ordered this for a reorder tart cherries great for oatmeal and sauses as well as snack	8
1	this product is the most flavorful and savory tasting broth i have ever tasted it is excellent as a cup of broth or a gravy base	8
1	full of good health goodies ! lots of fiber omega 3 flaxseed cooks fast i use the stove top method add raisins and pecans	8
1	i discovered nature's path organic heritage flakes cereal while i stayed in seattle wa for almost 6 months in the year 2000 i fell in love with it wholesome good taste and organic back in los angeles i had difficulty finding it in traditional health food stores last october i received an e mail from offering food items among them my beloved cereal right away i order 6 bags each of 32 oz i received it a few days after and ever since i feel very happy to get back to this wonderful combination of cereals besides that i'm getting economies of scale with the 32 oz compared to the 13 oz box i used to buy at the health food stores	8
1	i think my title says it all of course the packaging is not recyclable but it is at least minimal by today 's standards this is a lot of cereal for one person so i hope it has good shelf life	8
1	my favourite tea in loose leaf form it just does n't get any better than this the tins are a good size \( not so small that it 's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it 'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it \) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot the tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality i 've come to expect from twinings	8
1	this lady grey loose tea is a sensory experience it is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine the flower petals are pretty but i cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea it would make a nice gift for a woman who you do n't know very well all in all it is worth a try	8
1	lady grey is practically the only tea my family and i drink first we bought it because of cornflowers which are kinda symbol of russia where i was born but we stayed with it for the taste try it cold with lemon it 's amazing	8
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea the bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary the color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery i carry the bagged variety everywhere i go	8
1	if you hav n't tried lady grey try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price you wo n't regret it this is one of the best everyday teas i 've found with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day buying it on amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books i ordered at the same time	8
1	this is a great product and was better then i expected i needed a large quantity and working through amazon was great i was a little disappointed in the packaging because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape but being able to track the package was great	8
1	this tea really does help with stress i just sort of takes the edge off i have been drinking it for years and was very happy to find it at a good price on amazon	8
1	is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries we found it necessary to drink with our sweetener a refreshing drink but has a slight after taste to it maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it \( 4 qts \) i would have rated a 5 but taste was a little off	8
1	economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring easy to make and tastes great no guilt with this drink	8
1	these teas \( both the raspberry and the blueberry \) are priced lower than in the grocery store \( 3 49 per individual box \) where they are usually a seasonal item this is frustrating since my husband and i are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day they are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits this seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed we will be a repeat buyer for sure a ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	8
1	i really like this cereal by nature 's path it is very good and tasty however i just found a new favorite which is the zen version with cranberries and ginger i highly recommend both of them though the optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too	8
1	i love this cereal it is the greatest and looks like amazon offers the best price i like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk yum	8
1	and mild just a hint of fruitiness the white tea is n't as bold as green but equally as or better for you	8
1	do n't mind the reviewer saying it tastes nasty it 's quite good and as with any tea you can brew it as light as you want i do n't think this tea is too strong at all i brew it with the hottest water i can for as long as i can it 's a very healthy tasty beneficial tea highly recommended	8
1	i am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful very warming and spicy	8
1	high in protein low in calories and great flavor i split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack they keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline i ca n't say enough good things about kashi	8
1	they 're a quick fix and they taste incredible best protein bar around	8
1	i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception there have just a greattaste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying wheneaten between meals highly recommended	8
1	tastes too good to actually be healthy sound too good to be true \? i thought so but it is really true nice job kashi if you have never eaten kashi products you are in for a treat there are some i like better than others but for food that is good for you it is a pleasant surprise	8
1	i'm on no wheat dairy or sugar diet restrictions and this is my treat that i really look forward to \( sometimes every day ! \) thank you nana 's ! and the price is great from amazon	8
1	these are the only cookies i have found that i can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a real chocolate chip cookie i try to limit refined sugars wheat flour and dairy products in my diet for health reasons but oh how i miss cookies the ones i bake myself just do n't taste that great but these chocolate chip cookies from nana 's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating i do n't know what i 'd do without them ! i like to freeze them and sometimes i top one with a bit of rice dream ice cream on top yummy !	8
1	we love this cereal it is nice and crunchy and it does n't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes i definately will buy this again	8
1	i ordered these lorna doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area i even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either you should try them they taste great without the extra junk in them my kids love them 2 \)	8
1	the dried berries arrived promptly and in good condition we thought they were moist and tasty	8
1	i found a package of these berries first at costco in arvada colorado and found these to be the best dried fruit i 've ever had i 've since requested at my local costco \( honolulu hawaii \) that they carry these and i keep waiting and waiting i was thrilled to find these on the amazon website and ordered four bags right away thank you for carrying it	8
1	this is a dream ! quick brew and blueberry ! it 's slightly slower brewing than plain lipton quick brew tea but it does brew up in about three minutes it 's definitely blueberry flavored and it 's a little red in color for we impatient flavored tea lovers this is a great product	8
1	this is one of the best tasting teas i have used keeps well in the refrigerator for two days retaining its excellent flavor i reccommend this tea to everyone and have shared with many family and friends	8
1	these are very good biscotti ! i've ordered 4 boxes of 12 in the past few months they were nice to give as gifts they were good to bring to someones house for dessert the chocolate decadence and the ones with the toffee bits and almonds are very good the only negative is the shipping and handling cost if i did not get the free shipping and handling i would not have ordered them they're good but not good enough to spend an extra 20 to deliver	8
1	i was looking for a crispy crunchy not too sweet flavorful biscotti this prduct certainlyn fills the bill	8
1	twinings orange pekoe tea is a delightful smooth tea it delivers a pleasing cup of tea without acid harshnest yet it is full of flavor and rich amber color a good choice in the evening or anytime you want to pamper yourself with pleasure it 's a tea to be savored	8
1	love these as a snack when the day wears on great quality and taste	8
1	green is good of course but what 's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation crunchier more filling \( without being smarmy \) much better taste \( and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate \) fast eddie felson i love you	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	how often do you eat a parsnip \? well i do n't make the opportunity very often so i'm thrilled to see parsnips in my fancy black snack chip bag vastly superior to corn or standard potato chips no trans fats colorful too delicious dipped in hummus made by a division of hain for you health food business knowledge nuts	8
1	these are a great deal cost 2 75 per box they are 3 99 per box at our local grocery store they are also very tasty and a healthy snack our whole family loves them i worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people there is one on every box ! so they are good for schools too !	8
1	for rich deep flavor without tasting burned or smelling like chemicals these beans ca n't be beat nor can the pura vida company 's mission look into it	8
1	this is a great tasting coffee i highly recommend it as it is shade grown and fair trade certified	8
1	normally delicious product but amazon sent an expired batch the second time i ordered this item that was not the only time i received old expired or damaged batches from amazon grocery i really hesitate to do business with amazon you just never know what you will actually get	8
1	i have been a fan of jack links turkey jerky for about 5 years now ever since i first tried it all time favorite snack ! ! only jack links brand any other kind of turkey jerkey i have tried has been blah to say the least highly recomend ! ! ohh skip there ham jerkey and a1 sauce new products though eek	8
1	my kids love these i do n't mind the figs are the only part that are organic my kids will only eat these and not the other brand	8
1	i'm not exactly sure how good these are for you \? \? \? but i do know they taste great ! ! i bought these because i never have time for breakfast in the morning and i'm also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent !	8
1	for flavor i could give these cookies a 5 but the health aspects demand that they only rate a 4 all told they taste great and are the best on the go lunch i have found for hubby \( he often eats on the run \) the price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though	8
1	these things are great i love baker 's breakfast cookies this flavor is pretty darn good too big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor does n't taste fake at all i prefer a couple other flavors more but this is definately a winner these cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you they will fill you up for hours especially with a glass of water juice or milk to wash it down	8
1	these cookies are a nice break from the run of the mill granola bar based on oatmeal not too sweet filling great value i would purchase again	8
1	this is a nice tea not bitter i do n't need any honey or sweetner at all i 'll be getting more of this for sure	8
1	without a doubt this is the easiest buttermilk buscuit mix i 've ever used super simple super fast ! you wo n't be sorry you bought this	8
1	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	8
1	what other food is 120 calories \( only 25 from fat \) and 5 grams of fiber or 20 of your daily value \? an ideal breakfast or snack just one fills you up a lot and i must stress that they are delicious	8
1	i do n't like plain coffee but even more i do n't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers even the sugar free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated partially hydrogenated flavor blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere this is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar one packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with splenda are	8
1	this is a pretty good splenda flavor but the mocha is best in my opinion the french vanilla is a second favorite hazelnut is better than no flavor at all i use one flavored packet and one regular splenda packet in a large \( 14 oz \) mug and it 's perfect not necessary to use two flavored ones as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug	8
1	when i am short of time and want a fast side dish i make these and my family loves them when i do n't have time to peel dice boil potatoes these save the day teens can prepare them with ease too we like all varieties and they taste great	8
1	these are the best banana chips i 've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination ! i would highly recommend this product	8
1	i orginally bought this for my youngest daughter who loves this product soon after my husband was hooked and has been eating it for breakfast every morning since ! another great deal on amazon we buy it regularl	8
1	this tastes and looks like the real thing \( wheat semolina \) my kids ca n't tell the difference i'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now	8
1	these are great take a little longer to cook than wheat spaghetti and you must strain them but other than that you cant tell any difference	8
1	i liked this so much i gave some as gifts to friends \( before i polished it all off \) i am better able to stick with reasonable and healthy portions at my evening meal if i can look forward to a little treat later in the evening i serve it in a small cup that will hold a third of a box satisfying and healthy what a deal	8
1	i tried most of jack links' products i will classified this one as good but i personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier	8
1	these do taste almost like the biscuits at red lobster they are so easy to make and so delicious ! i have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about 10 minutes	8
1	we bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea it 's a great bargain if you 're a tea drinker ! ! ! \)	8
1	this is mine and my husbands favorite tea it has such a smooth satisfying taste we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best we ca n't always find it so when i found it on amazon i was elated being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) was just what we were looking for and we will continue to buy it here thanks amazon	8
1	these colombian d'ordado pods work well in my krups home cafe machine the overall flavor is good i do like my coffee a little stronger so i use 2 of these pods and the two 6 ounce cup setting for a nice big mug of morning coffee	8
1	this is a very good value i use it to put in many asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth the result is a more authentic asian taste to my recipes	8
1	we ordered 4 jars and love it it has great flavor and is on the spicy side it is easily frozen in the plastic containers the 20 oz size is just about perfect for our family of 5	8
1	i ordered this sauce which is very good and very spicy the only drawback is that when i opened the package one jar had cracked and leaked \( a real mess \) amazon sent a replacement and the same thing happened because they were not shrink wrapped first they were loose in the box with just some bubble wrap	8
1	typical of central italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all arrabbiata means mad in italian although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero recipe suggestions excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any mexican dish unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or saut ed portabella mushroom ! we 've also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea	8
1	i love this mac cheese it has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac \( warm and gooey orange cheese \) but without that vague chemical aftertaste it tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just no food in the fridge \( you do n't even need to add milk to this ! \) my favorite comfort food when i'm sick	8
1	annie 's homegrown deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar is the best mac n cheese straight out of the box i ever tasted kids and grown ups agree a note to the other reviewers do n't try to ruin my mac n cheese comfort food experience with your cardboard tastin' whole wheat pasta and no salt sauce if you 're so inclined to have it just how you would make it go ahead and make your own it 's just mac n cheese after all	8
1	my children and i agree this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market this is a great price too about 1 30 a box less than i usually pay when kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly i do agree with the other reviewer about the ways this mac and cheese could be even closer to perfection but i have one child who is very careful about what she will and will not eat and for her this product is a gift highly recommended	8
1	beautiful and easy to use ! the grater stays sharp after many uses and guests always ask about it i wish it came with a dish to put the salts in it would make a great gift if it came with a decorative dish	8
1	these cherries are large and plump and may need to be chopped for your recipe	8
1	shipping was fast and cherries were great the best dried cherries we have bought	8
1	i do not understand the bad reviews of this product they smelled great had a nice texture and tasted like a dried cherry should they did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do they also did not taste like cardboard or were dried like nasa space food like some of the dried fruit out there does i use these in my tea i chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream and i eat them straight out of the bag these are the best dried cherries i have ever eaten	8
1	the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered great deal and great service	8
1	i am a devoted earl grey tea drinker and have enjoyed earl grey tea all over the world ahmad tea has been my favorite for years i'm so pleased to be able to obtain it through amazon i used to have to carry it by the suitcaseful back from london to stock up	8
1	i bought select items to include with other items in gift bags for christmas the ahmad selection teas make two excellent cups per bag everyone receiving the tea commented on the fine quality of the product highly recommended !	8
1	i had been using sweetleaf before buying it at the local super market health food section buying here is around a 50 savings this product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste i just love that it is a natural product	8

1	if you are ever in the mood for summer sausage but do n't feel like cutting a piece off of a large log these are the ticket they have a great taste and are the perfect the snack ! highly recommended !	8
1	for those of you who like the addition of briny olives and capers to your sauce here is the answer what a great balance of flavors and a quick and easy yet delicious dinner alternative	8
1	adding another italian classic to our product line puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which to put it modestly translates into a lot of things going on at the same time the rich combination of flavors garlic black olives capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking recipe suggestions use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken fish or your relationship just heat and serve or bake it in try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative ! the favorite \? grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on	8
1	this pasta is very good it works great in salads casseroles or regular pasta dishes i 've only been gluten free for a few months and i think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta granted i 've only tried one other kind of gluten free pasta \( made all of brown rice \) but this pasta is far better and i like it enough that i feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds	8
1	excellent coffee good value plus you are aiding the growers which is a big plus	8
1	dried fruit \? the point of debate here is dried fruit these are delicious i ate many many handfuls each serving their more like gum drops because of the sugar added by infusion i'm suprised that the oil does not factor into the flavor at all not a typical dried fruit highly reccomended ! !	8
1	these things are so delicious i think that we have gone through 2 bags already put them in your cereal ice cream yogart and any other place you can think of i keep a bay by my bedside for those nite time muchies	8
1	oh my good god these are quite possibly the most delicious things i have ever eaten in my life i came across these raspberries last year at a costco here in socal and then to my dismay they recently stopped carrying them i 've since been searching everywhere and i am thrilled to finally find them here ! no other brand of dried fruit can compare their blueberries and cherries are also excellent \( and i usually do n't care for either \) highly highly highly recommended !	8
1	this sauce is so delicious ! it 's full of good ingredients and has a great shelf life my husband and i ca n't get enough of this sauce	8
1	i recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets tasty ! we also like the marinara so versatile flavorful and convenient	8
1	what a great line of sauces the scarpetta brand brings to the table i have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful i am able to put a what seems to be a different slow cooked italian meal on the table each night in just minutes the flavor profile of each of the scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade you can feel the love that went onto each sauce try them you wo n't regret it	8
1	first i 'd like to say that many of nana 's cookies are most delicious and i 've tried most of the flavors my favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip as one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie for those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions vegan sugar substitutes etc these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we 've been led to believe we want thanks nana 's for the natural foodie options	8
1	i used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the just tomatoes products now i have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting to have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me i love them too great for a quick low calorie healthy snack	8
1	our dog loves these treats and we love how good they are for him amazon has also been the best deal we 've gotten for them petsmart petco are a lot more expensive and do n't have all the flavor choices	8
1	these are great our vegan golden retriever seems to love them \( and is very healthy \) the cows pigs chicks are pretty darn happy she 's eating veggie treats the treats are organic and newman 's donates the profits to charities ! now that 's a win win win win ! i only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which newman 's should be well aware of \( why should we have to buy 6 packs of 10 oz bags instead of 30 oz or 60 oz bags \) \? when that 's resolved they 're getting 5 stars from me	8
1	excellent our dogs love them we have small dogs so the size is perfect little hearts for little dog	8
1	my little cockapoo loves newman 's own dog treats especially the peanut butter flavor she 'll usually eat anything but i feel better about giving her treats that are healthy organic and made with high quality ingredients that i could eat no by products here ! great price highly recommended	8
1	my husband and i like to buy newman 's products we love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them too so we got these dog treats and the love them they 're even shaped like hearts ! they come with 6 bags so they 'll last a while but they 're packaged so they wo n't go stale	8
1	great for cooking really tasty and handy only drawback is having to order 12 but they keep try to split with a friend	8
1	i use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream cookies cakes etc i find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated to obtain this i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk	8
1	these are the perfect snack for on the go actual real fruit no sugar ! no roll ups with 10 fruit ! they are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well just the right size for toddlers and small kids \( and moms too \) great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack works in any weather \( wo n't melt \) and even survives at the bottom of the purse ! comes in lots of flavors an organic version and bigger bars too for a bigger snack cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store great !	8
1	i used these to add to a christmas gift basket filled with special cocoa mix spiced tea mix fancy jam spread and three or four scones for family and friends and unexpected company everyone loved them and i had apackage or tow left for myself and they are delicious they are such a good value for the money and an exdciting addition for these gift boxes	8
1	we just love nonni 's biscotti products especially the limone ! it 's always refreshing not too sweet not too tart finding them on amazon was exciting because we have n't found them locally since coming to florida the product offered by amazon was also a great bargain	8
1	this is a delicately flavored not too sweet treat just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work	8
1	this is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick it will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine true it has a lot of solium but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals the seaweed veriety is the best open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away for others it may take some time to get used to do try your body will thank you	8
1	looks like it got squashed a little and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new but i checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there i tried one and its great this is a good buy for what you get i just got a damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased overhaull 4 stars out of 5 i will buy here again fast delivery thank	8
1	i received the correct item in a timely manner and it was organic my kids love them \( as do i \) i love finding healthy snacks that do n't have any additives or junk in them	8
1	i even drink it when im at home i carry a few in my make up case and when im away from home and thirsty instead of buying a soda full of sugar i buy a bottle of water and add the small pack and ready ! ! a delicious low calorie sugar less drink and this flavor is specially delicious ! !	8
1	i am a no coffee drink tea all the time person i have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones this has to be the most wonderful green tea out there ! ! it is wonderful ! ! !	8
1	i love this tea ! it is very refreshing and has a wonderful aroma it does n't get bitter like other green teas once i tried this green tea this was the only one for me	8
1	i am addicted to this green tea ! it has the smell of passion fruit i have to have at least 1 2 cups a day great buy ca n't find it at all stores and it cost half the price on amazon	8
1	these are my husbands favorite thing to eat thank you for making available at such a great discoun	8
1	the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five it is probably the best la briute product that i have found it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty	8
1	unlike the december 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there 's not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato i'm thinking that 1 \) the recent quality has gone downhill or 2 \) the december 2006 review was a plant anyway the taste was okay but it definitely does n't rate up there with legal seafood \( which i 've had at one of the restaurants and at the boston airport both much better than this \)	8
1	this is the best home style sushi kit you get the basics excellent rice sushi wrap sheets soy sauce i made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon in the rolls as i assembled them the best ! ! ! ! the possibilities are endless ! ! ! ! try it you 'll see sometime i can be all thumbs but this was very easy the quality of the food was excellent	8
1	quite tasty ! no flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers i was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money if the price goes down i 'll buy it again but not for 15 dollars a six pack	8
1	to get you through to your next meal my children and i love this flavor and it really tastes like peanut butter	8
1	pretty good solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem i enjoyed them for hiking and biking i do n't recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things	8
1	my husband loves ensavor garlic chicken stew he loves the taste the convenience and the fact that it is made for diabetics my husband is pre diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition he keeps ensavor in his office for lunch in his briefcase for meals out with clients and takes it with him when he travels it 's a great product	8
1	i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it 's great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it 's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up	8
1	if you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you they are higher in fat than i would like them to be but they are delicious great for a quick breakfast or snack there are 2 bars in each packett and i usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack	8
1	i am the newest member of the lose informal office oatmeal club i have introduced this hot cereal to many a members who are all hooked those who love oatmeal are and hooked and those who had to eat oatmeal as a kid and now hate it love it it tastes great has great farro or barley like texture and it smells heavenly and gets the appetite going	8
1	i discovered these a few months ago and now i eat them for breakfast everyday the nutrition info is good and so is the taste	8
1	i use this mix on a regular basis both my daughter and i are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting gf products this mix makes a great sugar cookie in fact when i brought some for a party at my daughter 's school kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought this also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie	8

1	this broth tastes just like roast beef rich delicious and full of flavor some may think it 's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt i'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks excellent product	8
1	i bought these nuts for my wife as she likes hazelnuts she seems to love this brand and she snacks on these nuts very often my only complaint about these nuts is the price but then everything that is good costs money	8
1	we love this product we use it in granola and in making the best chocolate hazelnut bark ever	8
1	last weekend as a volunteer at vegfest i had the absolute pleasure of getting to sample all three sauces for four hours i worked alongside the creator of these heavenly cooking sauces the wonderful thing about them is that they are not only delicious but are also so simply to use recipes are on the sides of the jars and they allow you the freedom to choose your favorite foods i ca n't recommend them highly enough	8
1	great substitute for high fat potato chips good amount of soy protein \( 6g per serving \) excellent flavor good crunch and texture these are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet no trans or saturated fats my wife and young daughter who do not need a low fat diet as i do love these woohoo	8
1	i love black pepper and have only recently discovered sea salt as a very tasty addition to foods and i like soy products and i am sorry to say a potato chip junkie so when i saw the description of these potato soy crisps i had to order them to try them boy am i glad i did ! they are very good right out of the bag but they are almost in the shape of little bowls so dips and spreads even cream soups can be scooped up in them they go with everything ! nice fresh taste too this one will be a staple in my pantry	8
1	i brought a few bags to a work day in may and people are still asking me about them because you ca n't buy them in stores around here they 're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips but instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy	8
1	i love this pasta ! it only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor i would prefer a 100 whole wheat pasta but this tastes so good i will continue to purchase this	8
1	the southwestern spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering and the rice is fluffy not clumpy like other brands i always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when i do n't have time to get out for lunch and in my suitcase for when i need a late night snack while travelling we always take viva la rice when camping backpacking or boating this is an excellent product at a very fair price	8
1	my kids really like to eat this as an after school or late night snack however they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package my oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch	8
1	the best tasting lollipops the fact they are organic is a huge plus our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill they have been a hit with my kids and all the other children we have shared them with	8
1	if you care about the sugar that your kids are getting and you want a great tasting lolly these are great ! ! ! wow	8
1	thse are the best lollipops i have ever tried organic or not the flavors are delicious honestly i would highly reccommend them to anyone !	8

1	i was n't sure about this as i normally buy green tea it is a very pleasant tea it smells great and is light	8
1	i was hesitant to buy this tea since all of the lipton brand teas i have tried have a musty taste and odor to me but the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea \( my two favorite fruits \) was irrisitable to me i am so glad i gave it a try the scent was incredible and the taste just as good with a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea i have ever had	8

1	these bars are terrific very moist unlike many other snack bars they are quite tastey and my kids really like them too	8
1	my son loves the yankees so i thought these were great when i saw them on teh website my son loves finding them as a surprise in his lunchbox	8
1	this product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce it can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables the taste is pleasing	8
1	these airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat i like this mandarin mint flavor the most but all are pretty good the small red bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors	8
1	i was a little surprised i'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes but sometimes i need to throw together something quickly i was intrigued by the list of ingredients and decided to give fox river rice creole a try i'm glad i did ! this is seriously good stuff lots of flavor easy to prepare etc best of all it 's not overly salty one of my pet peeves with packaged food it 's great as a side dish but i think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage \( maybe some andouille \) i 'll definitely be purchasing this again	8
1	my children love smart puffs i love the smaller packages for school lunches	8
1	this is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch the last bunch i got wasnt as enjoyable as i was used to i realised it was because it lacked crunch would buy it again though great guilt free snack great for kids too	8
1	these are sweet and crunchy and i love them my only concern is the price at a dollar a piece it 's a little more than my buget allows for a snack luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids	8
1	full bodied and flavorful make the medium cup for a smooth and mellow cup of java if you make the tall it will be alittle weak	8
1	of the gloria jean coffees mudslide is my favorite good taste when used with the keurig b70 and the 9 25 oz size brew i am on my 2nd order over 50 k cups made and have never had a misfire the previous reviewer simply had a bad batch	8
1	this jerky is awesome ! great shape extremely good taste \( kind of sweet for jerky but very tasty \) and very healthy \( no nitrites no msg no hormones etc \) try it	8
1	anyone who thinks cereal is boring for breakfast has n't tried this one it 's so tasty yet also healthy it 's my favorite but lately has been impossible to find kellogg 's is missing the boat by not giving this cereal a top notch advertising campaign because once people try this cereal they 're hooked ! now if we could only get it back on the grocery shelves or the online grocery again \( are you listening amazon \? \? \) in the words of another old commercial try it you 'll like it !	8
1	i was never big on cereals until i tried this one now i'm hooked thisis a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries it 's great for anytime you have the munchies but do n't want to eat empty calories it 's also the best of all the cereals thatadd fruit	8
1	we 1st found this coffee at a local store the local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that amazon sold it it has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well	8
1	this is the first gluten free product i found that my daughter likes perhaps likes is n't the right word she eats large helpings every time i serve it for a little variety i put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix this is the favorite in our household	8
1	another viva la rice ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture ! i do n't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work camping or to have at home	8
1	these brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor and i can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils preservatives unnatural colors or flavors because there are n't any ! so far i have made two batches neither batch came out perfectly chewy the first batch came out a little hard but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st and i think i'm getting the hang of it this is better than anything else i 've tried i had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives so this is a great treat	8
1	these brownies are pure and natural being all organic there is no chemical flavor that is usually present in boxed brownie mixes this mix makes a delicious batch of chewy chocolate heaven you can taste the richness of the real organic ingredients i urge you to try a box a chocolate lovers dream	8
1	if you are looking for gluten free cereal that is not sweet this is the one it tastes like corn flakes and holds milk well	8
1	the number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive this cereal costs 7 00 bag at my local health food store one needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags but it 's worth it to buy from amazon com by the case	8
1	when it comes to prepared cereals this has to be one of the best manufactured in north america in terms of value for money that it is also delicious and that it does n't go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy mesa sunrise and if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like organic kosher gluten free and so on then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication	8
1	i hate oatmeal i am not an oatmeal person i 've tried lots of different brands and flavors because i like the health benefits of eating oatmeal i bought this because of the flax seeds and wanting to incorporate more omega 3 fatty acids in my diet but what i got was a pleasant surprize this is a good tasting oatmeal i heat it up and add soymilk at the end to the consistancy that i like	8
1	this instant oatmeal is the only one i have had that tastes like real oatmeal it does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have	8
1	this bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full baslamic base note the chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home made but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces i 've made at home i like the other flavors of pasta sauce too but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture ripe fruit and deft balance of seasonings	8
1	unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar ! no artificial sweetener aftertaste i like that it 's low fat and high in calcium plus the canister \( instead of individual packets \) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference yummy on a cool day	8
1	this is my first freeze dried fruits experience fruits are very sweet except the kiwi was a little tart i have tried other fruits from the same merchant pleased and just received the apples i will slowly try the rest of flavors need to say more	8

1	this is a wonderful tea aromatic smooth and robust i have n't come across a better earl grey yet	8
1	this is in my opinion by far the best earl grey tea in the market loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer the 6 pack is a great deal	8
1	the opportunity to get twinings earl grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up	8
1	outstanding full flavored earl grey tea better than the other non branded earl grey teas	8
1	these are great the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package really tasty nice and crunchy i have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes \( but then raisins get everywhere \) and packages of dried fruit \( which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins \) these all bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy i sure wish amazon would sell these online	8
1	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
1	quickly became my favorite when it first came out tastes great and the milk does n't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals i also use it on ice cream to add crunch i would give it 5 stars but even though it think it 's great it is overpriced price here is about the same as out local safeway	8
1	my family always enjoys mini wheats and this shipment was no exception everything was just as tasty as store bought i have recommended amazon to family and friends when i had a question amazon was right there to solve the problem	8
1	finally a gf cf granola ! this stuff is amazing ! i got it for my husband and daughter \( 2 \) who are gf cf but i love this stuff too ! and i am truly not a nuts and seed person but i ca n't stop eating it ! i'm so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat ! my husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on	8

1	my wife loves strong coffee this is the only k cup that did the trick for her makes a good bold cup of coffee	8
1	excellent replacement for the campbells condensed soup i am able to cook gluten free for a crowd and no one can tell the difference with this simple substitution it is the best	8
1	this is an excellent source for omegas and efasand also great tasting all the benefits with out the drive to the healthfood store and their high markup on the price fantastic product from outside the us because ofuneconomic gullible politician false impressions	8
1	nutty taste this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings	8
1	i was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket a to amazon	8
1	what i like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total many other mixes make 12 or more and if you have a small household you 're stuck with way too many muffins these were better than expected they are soft flavorful and baked perfectly also use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking it is n't the healthiest food out there but overall i 'd recommend this mix	8
1	this is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor my dad 's a long time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile so he 's getting a four pack for christmas ! great texture great flavor great price	8
1	increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts	8
1	i first tried this product when i was studying in philadelphia i ordered it for an organic group i lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding i simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds no trace drugs just natural nutritionally beneficial components	8
1	would highly recommend this product i 've bought it for friends even to show them that granola could be this wonderful i 've tried the flax plus also but it was n't as good as the hemp plus i would also recommend the bar form of this product which does n't seem to be on amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores	8
1	hardley any bad ones in the whole bag i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more	8
1	the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying \)	8
1	these nuts are excellent just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit	8
1	i 've enjoyed this product for several years and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from amazon thank you	8
1	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	these bars have an amazing mildy sweet and nutty flavor ! the bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day ! they 've been around forever and i have n't found anything new that beats them yet ! the oats n honey is our family 's favorite flavor ! we 've tried others and always gone back to the true classic ! i usually purchase ours at the local grocery store but i am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal try it you 'll like it	8
1	this is a very tasty creamy hot cereal if you 're gluten sensitive give this a try after i switched to a gluten free diet i was missing oatmeal something awful i thought i would give this a try as an alternative and was glad i did ! with some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal	8
1	these were absolutely delicious i bought them as a treat for my co workers they disappeared very quickly we could n't stop eating them and will be ordering them again they are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting rather they are hand dipped in a lot of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge very fresh taste	8
1	i love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack the milk chocolate is great the rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate semi sweet to darker flavor and the marshmallows are just cool great for the wintertime stock up and enjoy also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights	8
1	they taste like graham crackers and are great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	i bought a case of these at the same time as i purchased the cheddar fries these are smaller packages so you get more in a case these are white cheddar steak fries where the cheddar fries are thinner and longer these white cheddar steak fries are white and very cheesey and salty snack they have unique flavor and do n't taste anything like the cheddar fries at all i gave it a 4 star cause i prefer the cheddar ones better	8
1	i love andy capp steak fries but be warned about long shipping times it has been two weeks since my order and i have n't received the product i do n't know if fedex style shipping would have helped	8
1	these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty do n't expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes they are just plain very good though and great in recipes	8
1	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
1	with free shipping using prime beats local grocery at twenty five bucks for six boxes	8
1	i have to agree best earl grey there is robust but not bitter i have tried the other brand \( s \) and none compare oh look 4 o'clock tea time	8

1	i have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and i have to say virgina diner english chocolate covered toffee is one of the best ! it is very fresh and it melts in your mouth	8
1	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
1	this coffee is amazing we stayed at the shore club in miami beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at ago restaurant hooked ever since this is the only coffee i ever drink now starbucks caribou are nothing compared to this one sip or sniff of the aroma will get you hooked forever if you ever make it out to south beach illy has a store on ocean drive	8
1	i received one of these meals after hurricane rita they were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored excellent product i wanted more so i could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency i found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet i was very disappointed until today i went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon ! this is great news ! i suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies they really come in handy	8
1	this peanut butter was wonderful ! ! smooth and creamy just like they said ! good price too	8

1	my title says it all a perfect blend of salty and sweet best of both worlds	8
1	the mix was a little lumpy had some hard chunks that would not dissolve they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter the mix was not expired it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage still came out o k and tasted great	8
1	just tried this granola today it 's really good ! the packaging is also great just like a milk carton no broken bags or messes to deal with and really easy to pour this granola has the perfect blend of grains and just the right amount of raisins	8
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	8
1	most green teas have a grassy astringent taste to them but this tea is unbelievably smooth and slightly sweet highly recommended as are all of rishi 's ancient tree teas	8
1	i recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak i purchased the loose tea leaves from amazon at a good price quick shipping english friends suggested pj tips \( \? \) tea which we found ordered from another online site twinning 's blows it away both the earl grey irish blend are great both on the pallet to the nose	8

1	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
1	i first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them my daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find i bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them ! he prefers them to all other similar crackers i purchased a large number of boxes \( which i keep hidden \) as they tend to disappear rather quickly	8
1	these are as close to the real thing as it gets i added chocolate chips to half of the batter and crasins \( dried cranberries \) to the other half i have had celiacs for almost 2 years now and these are the best gluten free product i have eaten ! i had to hide them from the rest of my family b c they liked them as well !	8
1	my 2 1 2 year old son cannot have gluten items and these muffins are very adaptable and tasty i add fresh apples bananas or carrots with crushed pineapple plus some cinnamon or nutmeg and he loves these muffins ! they are a bit plain without the additions though	8

1	these are tasty fresh and reasonably priced as finger foods my grandkids love them plain a good buy and great for the grandkids \( since mom does not know where we get them from and give them them in a plain paper bag \) personally i love them rolled in coconut oil and sea salt	8
1	i love the taste of this cereal if you like the puffed wheat sold in grocery stores for decades you too may find you love the fresh vibrant taste of these over sized grains of puffed delight best served in very cold whole organic milk i think i will go eat some now	8
1	very nice gunpowder green tea gunpowder green is fairly dark when brewed and has a robust flavor my favorite of the green teas timothy 's is quite flavorful and works well in the keurig	8
1	just get them ! we absolutely love this snack ! the flavor is unique and refreshing we even hide the bags from eachother so we get our own stash ! the other flavors are good too but this is sahale shinning star ! thanks for such an out of the box snack !	8
1	i love these snacks especially the valdosta blend the others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the valdosta it 's a great snack or salad topper delicious and good for you	8
1	no complaints on this one at all very mild and easy to drink	8
1	the kids love 'em and what could be better than that \? i bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here we tried the strawberry frosted and like other reviewers i agree not too sweet right amount of frosting ca n't wait to try the next flavor	8
1	these are our new favorite breakfast food fantastic ! ! ! ! we love them and that 's even after we 're on our second set of 12 boxes the strawberry flavoring tastes real not fake like regular pop tarts overall the taste is sweet but not overly so this flavor is better than the apple cinnamon which we have also tried definitely one of our best amazon purchases ever	8
1	satisfying and good tasting a little heavy on calories unless it is a meal replacement	8
1	very tasty and healthy product however i ordered many and discovered expiration dates when i got them some had only a couple of weeks which was not sufficient wish the date could be a lot longer and at least remind us about expiration dates in the ad	8
1	this is the best crumb topping i have ever made i got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you just add a few things and done what a pleasure	8
1	i must admit that although it was pretty good it made me want to go and find a good rice pudding recipe so i can keep the needed ingredients on hand to make homemade i made it with water but will try it with milk next time as suggested by a reviewer below great item to keep on your shelf to make something quick easy and it makes your kitchen smell good ! 4 servings 210 calories per servingtotal fat 1 5g \( 1g sat fat \) total carbohydrate 47gsodium 65mg fiber 1g sugars 20g protein 4g calcium 6 daily value	8
1	fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant almost overwhelming when you open the package the finished product is mellow and delicious not too rich i'm going to try it in the crock pot one of these days glad i tried it	8
1	this fox river rice pudding rocks ! quick cooking and you can adjust the consistency as i prefer it to be fluffy as opposed to creamy the cinnamon stick is a nice touch although i would not recommend this product for those of you on a high fiber diet \( like myself \) to lose weight as the overall fiber content is low it is a nice treat that is low in fat and is extremely delicious	8
1	my family really enjoyed this rice pudding i loved the real cinammon stick it gave the rice a rich flavor the aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat best of all is how simple it was boil the water empty package wait 20 minutes enjoy !	8
1	just what it says all white meat individually sized portable and easy to prepare perfect alternative for tuna sala	8
1	i am so glad i found these my son \( 22 months old \) is crazy about these apples and i ca n't find them at the store any more they have a really great flavor and texture they are very different than traditional dried fruit the apples are plump and actually look like they came from an apple	8
1	the love at first sip pods brew a very good \( but small \) cup of coffee in the melita one cup coffee maker the directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles \( which would fill a large mug \) but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak this pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1 2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self measuring system	8

1	i love these crackers for several reasons they are absoutely delicious to begin with and they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil they are hard to find in stores it 's a hit or miss thing here in the northeast so i ordered from amazon propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back	8
1	i tried this snack tonight and it was all i could do not to eat the whole bag well the night is young so i probably will i love the flavors and the spiciness of it	8
1	i bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth i buy natural snacks for my kids \( freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar \) but i find them bland so i ordered these and i love this flavor in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it was n't too spicy for her they use black pepper which is flavorful but i would n't call it spicy	8
1	i love these nuts i stock up on them whenever i can find them in the grocery store now that amazon is carrying them i can stock up whenever i go on a nut hunt they are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that i can not go back to the other brand actually i bought the big brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful these nuts have spoiled me for any other these are great ! !	8

1	since i love kellogg 's fruit harvest with strawberries and blueberries ithought i would try this one it is good but not as flavorable as kellogg 's it also has a nice mix of berries which includes raspberries as well as strawberries and blueberries you ca n't beat the prices forboth kellogg 's and golden temple in the supermarkets amazon is the wayto go for the best prices	8
1	these are the best almonds i 've ever had though it is true that the amazon ad states they are all natural \( an error on their part not on emerald \) they are very close to it the pricing here is a bit high at our higher end market i pay 5 49 for an 11oz canister the pricing is better to buy at the store than through amazon overall but if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close \( about 7 8 higher \) i do highly recommend this brand	8
1	this is dark rich coffee without a bitter taste i 've had to resort to adding creamer to get through other bold dark k cups the san lorenzo is good straight up	8
1	timothys coffee is my favorite ! and the 2 packs boxes is a very good value	8

1	fast and easy to make delicious to eat and no sugar or fat ! buying in quantity is economical and efficient	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	well what else can i say i love zatarain 's add a little sausage and you have a great quick meal	8
1	i bought these as gifts for the price you ca n't beat it the tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit i assume instructions for the warehouse packer when peeling them off a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol	8

1	anyone following a gluten free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten free version of anything and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good this is one gluten free product i am completely delighted with both in taste and price these corn flakes are crunchy and delicious \( i like them better than the glutenated alternatives \) and work well for other recipes candies cereal crumb pie crusts fried chicken etc	8
1	i love twinings but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time there needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product	8
1	this is one of my favorite teas this is 1 2 the cost of my grocery store and since the bags are individually wrapped freshness is not an issue	8
1	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
1	i love my tassimo ! for years i have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate starbucks lattes and mochas at home and this is the system that finally achived it i do n't use the latte capuccino milk pods unless i'm in dire straights it 's better to steam real milk \( search for milk steamer on amazon that 's a great product too ! \) but the espresso is great and i have n't been to starbucks in weeks hands down recommended no holds barred	8
1	i love my coffee machine but i normally do not buy t discs from gevalia due to price but found this on amazon wow 2 for 1 ! price is great even when you add in any cost for shipping etc still beats bead bath beyond with a coupon ! service and delivery were excellent	8
1	i purchashed crown prince fancy pink canned crab meat before i tried crown prince fancy white canned crab meat it s the best canned crab meat i love to eat crown prince canned crab meat it s on my favorite list	8
1	i 've tried almost every green tea on the market and this is one of my favorites it has a great flavor and it really does help me keep from snacking between meals i do n't think it 's possible to find great organic green tea at this price anywhere else	8
1	this is some great coffee \) perks you up gets you moving a good tasting highly energized morning wake up \) even better as an afternoon pick me up even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up	8
1	i am so glad i tried this coffee ! i also shared some with my neighbor who has a business and she took some to the office with her and now it 's the only coffee they want ! if you try this you 'll never want any other coffee i even travel with my own for my hotel stays \( perfect travel packs \) ! great job shock coffee and i love your sleep is overrated slogan	8
1	a trained eye would see that shock coffee is a blend of arabica robusta coffee beans ! just like many other ingredients there is good and bad robusta arabica beans wines are made from different grapes and it 's the individuals' pallet that distinguishes between good and bad in europe the coffee bean of choice is robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee with that said i 'd recommend shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste i 'd also like to reiterate that robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some robusta beans have a great robust taste no pun attended !	8
1	i love this coffee it has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning i do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee but rather what i would call trucker or cowboy coffee if you like strong coffee buy it if you like delicate coffee buy something else	8
1	this snack blend is the best ! i tried it on the recommendation of a friend and have come to love it it 's perfect alone but i enjoy putting the mix on salads it definitely spices them up a bit and the flavor is amazing i have become a big fan of this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks	8
1	i love these chips they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein i wish they were n't as high in fat as they are but they 're good for a once in awhile indulgence	8
1	this is very good coffee and is one of my favorites the moca gives it a little different flavor but it goes well with the dark roast beans i have purchased this item several times and would recommend this product to others	8
1	sorry i could not have rated 10 stars i feel they taste better than if i picked them myself ! i want to purchase more thank you amazon always ofering the best	8
1	bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries they make a huge difference and are worth the extra price i substitute them for the raisins in our favorite quaker oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter sugar calories !	8
1	why are people demonizing high fructose corn syrup \? the only reason it 's cheaper in the us is america has lots of corn eat more corn use more corn syrup unripe berries have less fructose mass harvesting them probably places unripe berries into the mix and its compensated for	8
1	i enjoy eating the product however the blueberries are very sweet the sweetness helps satisfy my sweet tooth and i do no have the desire for candy the nutritious value i am receiving from eating blueberries is beneficial for my wellbeing i keep them at bedside for a satisfying snack	8
1	i 've been a big fan of ener g foods alternative food products ever since i discovered that i was wheat and gluten allergic these have been my only substitutes for breads these muffins are very tasty and crispy when toasted and are instant favorites of mine also check out ener g 's light brown rice bread for sandwiches and their cookie assortment these are so good that i do n't even miss regular wheat breads and cookies	8
1	i 've purchased many of these products i put this in my top three good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick	8
1	i have tried all four fox river rice flavors and this is my favorite while cooking the rice the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen ! this flavor also has a little bite from the pepper i have served it with chicken and steak ! great product	8
1	i have never ordered anything such as this online i was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take i will consider ordering again once i have used these up the walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when i have purchased them at the grocery store	8
1	get your children to eat a little bit of fiber ! ! these are really good of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better !	8
1	hain popped corn cakes are simply delicious just enough crunch and sweetness to satisfy my hungry teenagers very healthy too	8
1	i absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else i 've encouraged to try some \( even my coffee drinking daughter \) i drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite i ca n't tell if it 's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys but i do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better also do n't let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally the box states that it 's mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days my only disappointment at the moment is that the six pack on amazon is n't currently available	8
1	i too totally disagree with the other reviewer who did n't like this this is a mild tasting smooth tea that you could drink anytime it is one of my favorite teas	8
1	maybe i'm crazy but i totally disagree with the other review i think this tea is delicious i do n't know if it really detoxifies your body but it tastes good	8
1	if you like a tasty oil sesame oil is one to try and this is a good flavorful sesame oil perfect for asian cooking and for 'tweaking' traditional foods that can use a touch more flavor	8
1	my two year old loves these and prefers them over goldfish i did a taste test with goldfish and the cheddar bunnies seem cheesier they seem less dry too	8
1	this mix is a blessing for those w food allergies ! even if we did n't have any food allergies i 'd buy this mix i do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer \( 10m \) if using a glass dish	8
1	i have tried all of cherrybrook kitchen products and they are fabulous ! even without eggs dairy and peanuts these products taste even better than if i made it from scratch their brownie is deliciously chocolately and if cooked for about 16 minutes comes out fudgy also ! i also like the chocolate chips right in the mix ! i would highly recommend it	8
1	the first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma it 's reminiscent of fish oil supplements having never eaten flax of any kind before i do n't know if the aroma is typical of flax at first serving i was sure i 'd consume the rest of the box \( eventually \) but would not buy more yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable i enjoy this cereal and will buy it again it has more fiber than any other cereal \( organic or not \) i 've seen	8
1	this product has no fat this is a good thing i like to mix it with my coffee for instant mocha	8
1	flavor is very good the reason i could n't rate it higher is that i have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in	8
1	my husband who has celiac disease thinks this is the best bread on the market it definitely is the easier to make only requires oil and water and turns out perfect every time amazon 's price beats those health food stores by a long shot ! try it	8
1	this bread is fabulous ! ! it actually tastes like bread and is light and airy not heavy like most wheat free products thank you orgran ! !	8
1	if you must have a cookie might as well make it a healthy one i bought a case and they went fast	8
1	i 've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were and loaded with fat and calories these are not only the least amount of calories that i 've seen for a vegan cookie of this size but i found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non vegan ones i 've had in the past ! they are so so so good whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate \? i have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that i am far from deprived ! two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic	8
1	this tea is amazing ! it tastes fresh smooth and light it 's just perfect i have about 2 3 cups a day makes me feel great	8
1	this makes a lovely gift everything is well packaged and looks expensive the teas are of good variety and well packaged to insure freshness recommend	8
1	gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product it can be coating to chicken or meat or can be added to juices broths to thicken it can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey it has make my boring diet almost feel normal no feeling of deprivation any more	8
1	these are sweet and lightly chewy with a touch of lemon it 's been a long time ago since i could get three organic healthy snack bars for a buck	8
1	i am addicted to wasa crispbread multi grain and you will be too very crisp and hearty flavor a healthy product with no saturated or trans fat and only 60 calories per portion the other wasa products are also worth a try especially sesame	8
1	i 've never reviewed a food item before but this delectable little bar was so heavenly i had to change my mind at the time it was a mere snack in between classes afterwards it earned a place in my heart as well as my eternal devotion toffee and almonds chocolate sigh what more could one ask for \?	8
1	high in protein low in calories and great flavor i split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack they keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline i ca n't say enough good things about kashi	8
1	ok i eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse this bar is the best i eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner the texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously love it	8
1	i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception there have just a greattaste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying wheneaten between meals highly recommended	8
1	i like the basic special k flakes made from rice wheat \( though i really should n't eat gluten \) mostly i use cereal to snack on vs with milk \( boo lactose ! \) special k tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which i like too but i was n't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal frankly i think it would taste better without them or with something else the yogurt pieces did n't seem to merge well with the cereal imho but then that 's why there 's chocolate vanilla	8
1	this is a great tea and very economical when buying bulk from amazon i'm very happy with it	8
1	if you like strawberries you 'll love crunchies ! only 98 calories per pouch i snacked on one pouch all day and did n't finish it off ! very convenient resealable i have other varieties on order !	8
1	erewhon rice twice cereal is a very flavorful crunchy gluten free cereal i highly recommend it to anyone who is on a gluten free diet	8
1	to rice krispies love the whole grain rice it 's crisy and it crackles and my gluten sensitive son loves it	8
1	as a vegetarian you can use this is many ways as a meat substitute	8
1	great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag california does some things better than us here in indiana coffee is one of them	8
1	smooth flavorful coffee i would n't mind a little stronger flavor but it 's very good huge bag	8
1	you 've just located the most healthy tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today ! as a long time user i can tell you that amazon offers the best possible price for this item i use it for everything a flavoring for plain rice as a broth for stir frying \( instead of oil \) as a base for complicated stews and soups if you find it a bit too salty just add more water it has no mysterious chemical additives it is perfect for heart patients diabetics vegans and folks who just like a fast soup treat	8
1	seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix ! one canister makes 40 cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive it 's also delicious it makes a truly versatile soup base people love my nabeyakiudon \( japanese noodle soup \) matzoah ball soup \( jewish dumpling soup \) golden lentil stew \( indian bean stew \) all of which have seitenbacher as the base it works for people with allergies and food sensitivities \( no gluten no lactose no msg no soy \) it 's all natural and vegetarian \( no gelatin \) and i ca n't emphasize enough the rich deep flavor	8
1	thanks to our purchase of a keurig i am a converted coffee drinker timothy 's german chocolate cake is my absolute favorite a delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium bodied blend it is n't too sugary it 's just right ! in fact my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too it is scrumptious	8
1	great flavor and aroma an excellent choice for an evening coffee break	8
1	i love velveeta and i love the rotini and cheese i have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores i shop at i found it not to be as good as i remembered the broccoli was minimal at best	8
1	i was eager to try the sugar blend for baking i noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact the usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package the flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life	8
1	i am crazy about splenda i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael it saves money and calories asparteem \( nutrasweet \) gives me loose bowels splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories	8
1	all the splenda products are good but i like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic	8
1	this stuff is delicious ! i 've been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself \( i feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff \) and it seems to be a pretty good choice it does n't take a lot to satisfy and it 's not really that bad for you \( sugar sure but not as much as some other treats \)	8
1	i love these ! my son loves these ! you would think there would n't be a problem but he sucks on them as they melt his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also ! but they are so yumm ! fyi 13 g of sugar healthier cereal have 5 7 g so i guess it is n't so bad	8
1	excellent cookies my boys love them know they are a treat that is on the healthy side we will buy these again	8
1	i love these cookies too ! they 're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that does n't feel waxy in your mouth the lemon taste is great and they 're not too sweet they 're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but do n't want to overdo it with calories or sugar the box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it	8
1	these are a perfect size for work and great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	i so love this jerky it is moist but not too moist and has great flavor we have tried several of their flavors and they are all awesome great prices for hormone free stuff and no preservatives jerky tastes so much better and richer without msg in it	8
1	it was a little expensive but well worth it it lasts allday long or several teapot	8
1	i love these cookies ! the only complaint i had is that i ordered a case \( 12 boxes \) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day i received the shipment yikes i still have over half the case left and i 've been eating them daily \( and giving them away \) ! i probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone however if you 're looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option	8
1	i doubt if most kids would like this bar but health food fanatics will love it subtle flavor mixed with chocolate bar is very filling dry use with water	8
1	my son \( 3 \) and i love these he likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them he likes all the bunny graham varieties \( chocolate honey cinnamon \) they taste like the traditional graham crackers	8
1	okay so i realize this is n't a real veggie merely a veggie that 's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip but man they are good what 's more there are n't any bad ingredients in this product and they 're baked not fried ! better still my kid prefers them to chips so while i do n't totally win the make your kid love veggies award with this snack i feel i'm one step closer oh and i love them too	8
1	these are a fun little snack they taste good and are crunchy so you can pass on the potato chips they have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins they are not low in calories so be careful of the amount you eat my daughter likes them which is a plus the price was good at amazon but the shipping was steep	8
1	i 've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and have n't made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it 's marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki \( perfect \) a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism	8
1	this is a wonderful gf cereal ! it is crunchy a touch sweet and the fruit is a wonderful addition this is the first gf cereal that my son will really eat he frequently has 2 bowls and he does not eat much ! highly recommend	8
1	i'm not a huge coffee fan most of the time i find it bitter then there 's the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints but occasionally i do feel like i need that little surge of energy this kona blend coffee is the perfect choice it has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness i find in a lot of other coffees this is the one i put in the coffee maker when i plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis it makes great iced coffee too	8
1	that 's all that matters to me i ca n't always find it in stock at the local store and i want my husband to be able to enjoy it i'm not a real coffee drinker but this kona blend seems to lack the bitterness that first turned me off coffee years ago in the first place so i enjoy some of it too occasionally and whatever blend he 's drinking my husband likes millstone brand i know it always smells wonderful	8
1	i love this soup it is healthy vegetarian and low calore for a light meal i eat it alone when i want something more substantial i mix in leftovers and a dash of hot sauce the microwave bowls make a good portion size it is really convenient to have it delivered in bulk to my door	8
1	i 've tried the andy capp hot fries white cheddar and these regular cheddar these have a satisfactory flavor and do n't over do it i find them a good snack with tasty underlying corn flavor and a non greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products they are different from cheese doodles cheese doodles are more about orange coatings and are uneven in texture i think it must be the corn potato combo in the andy capp products that makes them feel good to eat	8
1	andy capp fries have become my favorite crunchy snack i like both the chedder and hot fries the texture and flavor from both varieties surpass my love of potatoe chips and cheese doodles highly recommend andy capp fries in both flavors	8
1	supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too favorite uses coffee tea and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal i ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs supermarket prices unfortunately there was a terrible delay i ordered on feb 2 and did n't receive until march 20 otherwise no complaints and i'm fixed for sweetener for a good year	8
1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	this product has been a lifesaver to me with wheat allergies and loving pasta i thought i would never get to eat it again ! the pasta tastes great and my family does n't even notice the difference they like it too ! thanks orgran	8
1	i have sensitive to sugar teeth and these are beautiful and healthy most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value no thanks these are good for you and taste rather good too they are a bit bland but i like the texture with what 's in them and how they 're held together they 're a bit like rice krispy treats but taste healthy yum i love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine	8
1	i bought this tea for my mom for her birthday and everyone in the family loves it this is excellent chai tea	8
1	this is amazingly good ! worlds apart from the usual mac and cheddar products on the market really worth trying ! delivery was fast and everything arrived just fine i highly recommend this product	8
1	pemmican premium and long lasting peppered flavor is the best i have ever had by far and i am a certified jerky freak they are not stringy or rubbery simply easy to eat and absolutely delicious	8
1	excellent taste and texture the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture if you really like your crunch i 'd go for the all apple product my only disappointment is that you 're not getting a lot for your money i love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon so i 'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one	8
1	i found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack i have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just do n't taste that good nice surprise	8
1	i bought some nana 's no refined sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale they were so incredible i looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here these cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well really all of the flavors i tried \( choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin \) were outstanding	8
1	green is good of course but what 's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation crunchier more filling \( without being smarmy \) much better taste \( and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate \) fast eddie felson i love you	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste packaged as they are \( 2 resealable packages of 20oz each \) it 's a very economical buy too just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first our kids like these better than raisins	8
1	i have ordered stoneridge orchards dried montmorency cherries twice the cherries have arrived in good condition and taste wonderful	8
1	i was very pleased with these dried cherries they are delicious not too sweet not too tart healthy too	8
1	i 've never been a big fan of dried fruit good for you or not they are just too sweet for me but these montmorency cherries are wonderful it 's the right mix of sweetness with tartness i love to eat these straight out of the bag	8
1	this is yet another fabulous blend of ingredients not too sweet not too salty great for kids and us big kids who are on the go and tired of the same old trail mix protein bars on the run keep up the good wor	8
1	i am a prediabetic person this product helps keep my sugar under control my numbers are great after i eat this cereal	8
1	love this oatmeal ! no sugar which is a bonus for athletes wanting good complex carbs w o added sugar one packet gives you a nice creamy treat much creamier than other instant oatmeals highly recommend it	8
1	this is great instant oatmeal i eat it almost every morning i used to buy the quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but i will continue to buy this it is very convenient to order this in quantity even though i'm the only one in my household eating it since i go through it pretty quickly	8
1	since the description says this product contains splenda i do n't understand why the guy who posted a bad review would avoid amazon grocery products at all costs just because he apparently did n't read the description before buying mccann 's makes great oatmeal read the description before buying anything would be my adivce	8
1	excellent product amazon 's prices were very good a few months ago however now the price is more than the popcorn costs in the grocery store	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
1	delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet buying it here is a bargain too	8
1	not only does this stuff taste wonderful but it 's much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves i would definitely recommend this as a great snack	8
1	even though it 's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor in this way it 's even better than standard dried fruit	8
1	one of the best varietals i have tasted smooth and rich almost syrupy like most of timothy 's coffees delicious ! !	8
1	nice flavor and aroma i like the darker blends and this is a little light but still flavorful	8
1	these cookies are unbelievably good perfect with a cup of coffee or tea perfect alone i stopped buying them because i just could not stop eating them if i could buy them in packs of three or four then i could have them in the house again	8
1	planters cashews in milk chocolate are so so delicous ! i am absolutely addicted ! they are so good a great snack or dessert and they even come in different sizes one size for home and one smaller size for on the go ! i could not ask for tastier chocolate or more wonderful tasting cashews ! try 'em amazoners you will love them ! thank you	8
1	tastes great and the price was good	8
1	i have used this product for a long time as lipton has always been a trusted brand i do go through a lot of tea so buying it on amazon was quick and more affordable then other stores	8
1	my family loves this coffee this decaf is very smooth it does not have a weird decaf aftertaste and we will continue to order this it 's the next best thing to having kona coffee which we cannot always afford	8
1	the shells are a nice change from the otherwise limited choices of gltuen free pasta shapes i will buy these again	8
1	wonderfully totally delicious you don't want to finish the last kernal it's just so popp'n good	8
1	both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands	8
1	i buy this at sam 's club for about 12 2 before i became enlightened re organic products i was a folgers user this coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level but is flavorful for the price this is an incredible deal	8
1	this tea is comforting when feeling ill or under the weather also it has a pleasant taste i highly recommend it	8
1	the grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly i 've become weary reading labels i 've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality nature 's path organic blueberry toaster pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious they heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack i 'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies therebeccareview com	8
1	i enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk it is good especially when i eat it which is what i do	8
1	this fills me up and it tastes very good i only with the box was bigger i can only get 2 bowls per box	8
1	i have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and i still look forward to eating it it has an interesting flavor that i know i will never get tired of i highly recommend trying it	8
1	this is my favorite cereal i recommend it to everyone i can i eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time best of all it tastes great i agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty but probably useless as the body ca n't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the omega 3 but it adds nice texture and nuttiness also amazon has a great price on this vs grocery stores	8
1	this is our favorite cereal and it 's so much cheaper here than at the grocery store the boxes run out fast so it 's nice to have several and not have to buy it at the store all the time	8
1	like oatmeal with good taste and texture a little sweet \( i cut it with plain oatmeal \)	8
1	you wo n't want anything on them either ! they are that good warning be prepared for quite a number of broken and crumbled crackers from the shipping	8
1	excellent product for those on a wheat free diet have a hamburger again with a real bun ! even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating enjoy	8
1	these cookies are very good and you can actually eat quite a few before the calorie count starts to add up i shared them with some friends and everyone thought they were excellent	8

0	ok so the song playing when brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called deep enough \( urban remix \) by live i have the other songs written down including the one played between the two buildings so i will find them and tell you if you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie rent the dvd and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists that 's how i have only the songs that are in the movie	9
0	there are 2 really good songs on here the first is untitled which sounds like gibbard was listening to a lot of brian wilson at the time he wrote it the percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds underwater is a pretty good song but the real jewel on the album is send packing it really is a beautiful well written song the rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments basically the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly all in all i would n't spend 10 bucks on it but a couple tracks are pretty good	9
0	this is not the music from the movie this purchase was a major dissapointment you would do beter searching for the music credits for titles then download the tracks form your music subscriber	9
0	it is beyond me that a record label would put this out it 's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure subject the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors	9
0	after months of searching i found the out of print cd here i had never heard it but after hearing the fabulous song quot my only quot from the quot good as it gets quot movie soundtrack i had to hear the album what a disappointment ! oh well it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song	9
0	listening to the standards being sung by rod stewart is like listening to classical music being played on a kazoo ! if you 're new to this music try out some sinatra cd 's he 's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the standards	9
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people \? sorry i just cant see it i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's if i could only be sure on the first track at all if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !	9
0	might just be me but this is one of those cd 's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one maybe i'm too old for the rest but wish i had kept the crystal so i could sell it on ebay	9
0	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	9
0	i love love tegan and sara and when i found out this was one of their favorite cds i have to admit i think i was devastated i just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse not just not enjoyable unbelieveably horrible i think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music do n't make your ears go through this much pain	9
0	many albums including this one have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting except for the first two tracks the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music what about everything and life less ordinary are good songs the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep	9
0	wow did someone slip the wrong cd into my jewelbox or what \? if you 're a fan of allison 's other work epect nothing like what you 've heard before this is mostly a pop album and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering the sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding even allisons voice has no drive to it steve earl is no match on the guitar for joe mcmahan who played on the show cd dvd	9
0	i was disappointed with the album as a whole when i heard the song drink to me babe then i thought it was great and sounded like the shins the rest of the album was boring lyrically	9
0	layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time cream is one of the most boring bands in history why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like dire straits and metallicawho rock ps this clapton compilation has no good songs so please do n'tbuy it at all	9
0	having watched most if not all of john waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this album obviously his name was put to something he had n't quite looked deeply enough in to talk about misleading as we all know john waters has a certain reputation for sleaze trash camp kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms this album had none of this shame on you john waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis	9
0	oh this is pure adult garbage all right i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this then again the movie was garbage also	9
0	i purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend a few hours later in ended up in the bin very dissapointing bland and not to mention boring and derivative \( some people from new york would understand what i mean \) in summary not only does kylie mingogue \( i wont grace her name with capitals \) fall flat on cd she also cannot perform live and rely 's on gay camp it up imagery to hide behind \( a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit \) a very bad performer and a shameful album	9
0	if any kid music annoys you this cd is not for you these are good old classic songs but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs i'm throwing it away i want my two year old to know the songs i know and love but this was a bad buy on my part	9
0	having listened to steven 's previous albums greetings from michigan and seven swans countless times i cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album stevens blatantly rips off his own music i consider michigan to be sufjan 's masterpiece do yourself a favor and start there	9
0	why is dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing \? shame on you bob	9
0	man can she get anymore stupid and talentless she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career just because your a great actor actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing too some actors actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez she needs to quit the music business while she still can please stick to acting oh wait ! i forgot she ca n't do that either !	9
0	ok booty rap was good in the 90 's when it was offensive and raunchy like 2 live crew disco rick and the dogs poison clan etc but this is just wack weak lyrics corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same and is it just me are these guys as rappers just horrible there voices all raspy and annoying and one the guy 's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr \( what is he on crack or something \) so if you like radio friendly pretty boy music then the ying yang twins are for you peace	9
0	i luv fall out boy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awl songs get 10 outta 10 ! ! ! ! ! ! deservs all 6 starss ! ! !	9
0	after reading her excellent halloween book i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning i always search for different halloween cds but this was filled with the same old stuff chains moans and spooky laughs then more chains moans and spooky laughs very dissapointing	9
0	i do n't want to hear any more of their music on the radio it is all just nonsense and none of it should have ever been made they are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory	9
0	the main problem i have with this cd is that it seems poorly mixed there is no sonic depth to it all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other	9
0	when i think of the sex pistols i think the monkeys did it better as a boy band let 's face it dears that is all the sex pistols were a marketing ploy they are f g nsync for another generation	9
0	this one is for you but honestly now the guy does n't write beautiful voice but songwriting is a major appeal so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake ok there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork \( what a \) wonderful world but generally this a very casual compilation good for a couple listens in general art garfunkel is n't really good for more than that check out him witht paul simon that is amazing stuff but this is kinda boring i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs but even though there are good songwriters writing for him the songs are still sub par	9
0	bought this cd based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums i like and man what a mistake this cd borders on unlistenable with no discernable melody talent to be found i'm hardly some ignorant pop music lover i consider blueberry boat to be one of my favorite records but this is just horrible	9
0	this cd is awesome from beginning to end i really enjoy listening to this type of music this cd is a must have	9
0	great cd imus in the morning recommended highly and the i man was not wrong one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years i listen to a lot of buffett james taylor delbert mcclinton and this cd places high in these ranks	9
0	this collection of 15 great hits of nicola di bari in spanish is missing one of his most \( if not the most \) important and popular song quot lisa de los ojos azules quot i would n't buy this cd without that song	9
0	the cd is great ! ! ! the legendary johnny cash comes thru loud and clear on this cd however it took amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them their attitude of just wait a few more days and email us again was both insulting and annoying thank goodness this was n't a christmas gift for someone	9
0	as if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough a f 'in grease video \? \? \? ! ! ! ! ja officially became a diva with this album this album is horrible the pledge had some life due to nas appearance thats why it 's hard for me to request a zero star rating bottomline if ja 's body was made up of his albums this part would gangrene maggots would avoid this and you should too	9
0	i love to hear old standards and such but i like to hear people who put their own take on it i ca n't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe where are the male versions of nora jones \? tone down the cheese ! we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter \( not hams like buble dusk or boring singers like diana krall but what can i expect from the music industry \? rarely do the best song stylists get lots of attention so hmmm nevermind i guess it 's always been that way	9
0	jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse seriously think about marc bolan trying to sound like a '50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like	9
0	based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish jason falkner and the beatles i was expecting a lot better instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to is the guy talented musically \? yes but his voice is mediocre and his songs really do n't do it for me sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others wo n't be mislead by the breathless reviews here i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre	9
0	this was not as good as i had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while i am working out but the rest is good	9
0	i was disappointed by ms jackson though it 's not such a big loss b c i did n't pay much for it none of the songs jumped out at me thank god i did n't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it	9
0	know here is man with absoultely no lyrical skillsbaby dont get with a wanksta good girl wants a gangstawhat about girls just want normal people no way can anybody like slim thugeverybody likes a pimp onli weird and freakish people doslim thug isnt a thug if he was he would be in jail studo gangsta gangst	9
0	i basically love anything mr carter does but this one has alot of great lyrics \( as usual \) i'm so glad he 's coming out of retirement any fan of jay z will enjoy this cd	9
0	it would be impossible for me to write you a review i never received the subject cd you sent me some piece of crap dics which i sent back i have not received the gene watson cd i ordered and paid for if i do n't get it soon you will never hear from me again edward n clark herrin i	9
0	no need to say more these f gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they 're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182 there just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts	9
0	i used to like good charlotte enough that i bought this cd but i really do n't like them at all anymore they try to look all punk but they are pop they whine a lot i think it 's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool they should at least stop doing songs about it they have some ok melodies and words but for the most part all their songs sound the same good charlottes first two cd 's were almost good but this one is bad and really whiny	9
0	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 right before female rappers \( there 's a few exceptions \) i hate all little kid rappers even when i was a kid i do n't like anything on this album i still got the tape and it has n't krossed my mind to even cop the cd if you like this kind of stuff or you loved jump back in the day then i guess this is for you	9
0	there used to be a time when rap was not synonymous with the likes of hillary duff no longer is that true if you call this rap puff was n't that good to begin with and i never owned any of his cds but i knew of him anyway by the time i heard he changed his name to pdiddy i about laughed until i pissed myself \(	9
0	this soundtrack was `heart brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film i bought this soundtrack for one specific song \( and it would 've been worth every penny if only it was included \) the song near the end when alexander marches through the desert to return home to babylon after his recovery such a disappointment that was n't included in the other hand i'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included i particularly liked roxane 's veil even though i do n't recall hearing it in the film	9
0	this album made me realize that darn record company produces for examle two regular albums two best albums two tribute albums and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds like new but actually an old albums from a musician this is an example of the mixture of previously released re released at last over released best tracks with a sounds like regular album title let me tell you one thing jp is dead and gone since rob left the band i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you 'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying	9
0	this music is a rip off all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy a shame	9
0	i bought this album after hearing america their single off this album and listening to the increasing hype about razorlight and johnny borrell being one of the most talented singer songwriters of his generation this follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first it 's not bad but it 's not that good either the songs all sound like i 've heard them somewhere before and the lyrics well how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone nothing on the radio and not known what it all meant while smoking cigarettes late at night yawn	9
0	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it kids also like to eat mcdonalds but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative seriously do n't buy this !	9
0	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs girls cars and jewelery i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat save your money	9
0	i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	9
0	maybe her harp playing could be acceptable but when she sings everything turns awful the worst singer i ever heard	9
0	this cd is not at all what it appears to be they got other people singing and playing the music so it 's not what you 're probably looking for terrible misrespresentation i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i used my other party cd 's or my guests would have left and i would have held the door open not blamed them for leaving !	9
0	wild card is the best song on this cd the rest just did n't do it for me and i did n't care for the latin flavor this cd was a mess if the rest of the songs were along the lines of wild card i would have kept the cd this did n't say rippingtons to me	9
0	gnr were a very overrated band i found appetite for destruction very dull this atleast has the band 's 3 great songs in november rain civil war and live and let die get this for 3 great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums ! ! they are not metal !	9
0	very possibly the worst cd i have ever heard in my life i could barely force myself to listen until the last song was blissfully over this is not music it is stupid noise !	9
0	rob touches on so much with this cd my favorite song is one that has n't got any airplay and in my opinion the public missed out a great hit ! streetcorner symphony is about people coming together it 's what i call my happy song each day as i go to work i play the song as loud as i can get it ! we my daughters and i saw him live and he also called it a happy song ! i ca n't wait for his live albulm to come out ! there are fast and slow songs on this cd and will be worth every penny you spend to buy it ! incredible voice and songwritting	9
0	however despite what amazon reviewer kristy martin may believe ms croft does not need to get her freak on wow i guess hip hop can do no wrong in a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film here comes another fanboy girl of hip hop 's hopele ley misplaced garbage thank you kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along \( missy \) this song is soo done it 's practically taboo to listen too and outkast \? puhf ckingleez these clowns sold out a long long time ago	9
0	this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g funk heyday warren g did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before the skits are ridiculous the music is halfass and the lyrics are amateur there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w c and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's it takes a thief one star for the hit single summertime in the l b c	9
0	any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as boulevard of broken dreams \( a 1934 hit song \) deserves to be ridiculed not rewarded with a grammy i'm just full of original ideas i ca n't decide whether to write a song called wake me up before you go go or grandma got run over by a reindeer or maybe do you know the way to san jose \?	9
0	i did not like this cd at all there was not even one song that i liked however given the positive result the cd received it may just have been my personal taste i also got her new cds and did not like those eithe	9
0	i woke up this morning to the grating sounds of good little girls blaring over my clock radio 's single worn out speaker a speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year such as there goes my life and live like you were dying good little girls is easily the worst country song i 've ever heard and i thought neal mccoy was bad ! blue country is the c w equivalent of wham ! \( a dated reference to be sure \) maybe i'm just getting too old for country music	9
0	i agree with all the other reviewers nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades great playing from all concerned \( except the cursed drummer \) i cannot imagine what poor jerry gemmot went through with that drummer he should have been dismissed immediately or shot it would have sounded better without him gawd' awful spoils the whole dang thing any way i cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable so it 's back to soul of a man re kooperation live adventures super session and kooper sessions with shuggie	9
0	any one who is a fan of luther vandross will be sorry if you purchase this cd it 's not a tribute it an abomination	9
0	this is a pep rally on cd an unsingable emotionally charged pep rally it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music the melodies are not easily singable at all and the songs use all the same musical cliches this is worship manipulation at it 's best if you read the words to learn something concrete about god you will find nothing of substance they talk about actions to give god and our response to god but no meat and potatoes of why we should be doing this god is great but why \? this is very disturbing and completely unacceptable for congregational worship	9
0	i was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the robert rodriguez band chingon but what the hell is this \? ! ! ! the amazon recomendations lead me to this album and hinde sighti should have read a little more before buying but i was too excited to hear more of the rodriguez chingon i hope this helps you	9
0	with perverse mike edwards set out to prove that jesus jones was more than a `sunny breezy pop band' what he ended up proving was that if they were n't no one was interested sad to say but pop hooks were what people expected from jj and actually there are some here but they are smothered by industrial techno gook stick with doubt that 's where jj peaked even if some claimed they had `sold out' here they are pushing the boundaries but that does n't always make for a great listening experience	9
0	this album is disgusting no musical talent this people are the farthest thing from musicians if you enjoy overproduced music and a rip off of fellow label mates fob and p ! atd buy this it is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record shaant ca n't sing either go back to buffalo	9
0	i thought something must be wrong with my stereo when i first played this cd brooks and dunn have created some great work but this is far from it many of the songs are so dischordant i would swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something about two decent songs the rest are not worth having around try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent	9
0	while some would call orange and acme studio albums suggesting that they lack originality but they have rythm i would call myself a big jsbx fan i play orange and acme constantly however i feel that this album is a little too much free form and free noise for the everyday listener i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx because it is a rather acquired taste	9
0	too lisa loeb for me sorry maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics	9

0	simon amp garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music \( most notably for the film the graduate which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic \) this cd dates very badly as all thier music does it 's got a very limited appeal only for diehard fans but beware thsi music really sounds dated i mean it 's really unlistenable	9
0	he just needs to retire screw this non gangsta no real g sings they just rap god	9
0	this cd is garbage juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album he was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one if i was you dont listen to the retards who tell you this is a good comeback album instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend welcome back by mase that is a good comeback album the only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of mannie fresh juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats a shame they could n't go to ja rule whose cd sucked with his beats he has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow	9
0	i 've never written a review but i just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot and you 're killing hip hop stop killing my music	9
0	there is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on amazon you would n't buy if you could i read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way this band is nothing even near metallica i have thrown the disk away do n't bother	9

0	hey that just goes without being said all of their live albums suck because they suck go creed ! i ca n't wait for scott stapp 's solo album ! awesome baby	9
0	im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately \( think tony gayo \) there are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore all prodigy does is spit run on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he 's just there to be there amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them did we really have to hear this one to see that \? if you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving	9
0	and what 's the point \? all of these songs \( minus a few \) are on the anthology along with countless others the beastie boys did n't put this out their record label did it 's just way for corporate to make money if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan that is you 're interested in all the other music they made that was n't put on radio then do n't buy this if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song then go ahead the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits to fully appreciate them you have to listen to an album all the way through	9
0	as for many of these kind of unknown groups the music in the album is useless in the meaning that this music has no use it is not relaxing it is not for contemplation it is not spiritual it is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of ambient but ambient music is music this is crap well differently from two a d where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold because people is n't stupid two a d is light years away from this crap do n't waste your money listen the the samples by yourself to grab what i mean sergi	9

0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band and the horrible more than a feeling they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica's 4th lp today get and justice for all by metallica insted	9
0	after reading so many positive reviews i was very exited when i recieved this cd in the mail i popped it in my bose wave radio turned it up to 85 and listened to the most annoying hissing sound i 've ever heard coming from my system i regret purchasing this cd	9
0	please change your name to \( kid rap \) when you start producing true rock cd 's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name stop playing both sides i realize that the rap hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about do yourself a favor and take the rap hip hop out of your so called music one day you will realize that the rap hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away	9
0	this movie was only good because of two reasons rammstein and queens of the stone age other than that completel out of control p o s that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell	9
0	especially when there 's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful the songs are so cheesy her voice is out of place in half the songs it 's whiny irritating dull and at this point i'm not sure who 's more talented her or her sister they got the looks sure but there 's lots of pretty girls in this world does n't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd that 's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album i'm sorry jes but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say	9
0	jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice but you wo n't get the chance to hear it on this cd this cd is a complete let down it is her worst one yet ! do n't get me wrong i love jessica but seeing her waste her god given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so tragic	9
0	when will amazon allow a zero stars rating \? \? \? \?	9
0	as much as i have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled chemistry between buckshot and 9th wonder the beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone they are working on a part two so i hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was	9
0	i like funny rappers who have some talent at least i do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all and even the people that i know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they do n't like it at all by the third time truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke avoid this one	9
0	tihs album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day i like all his other albums better i do n't know why he decided to release this crap but the only song i really like is hip hip qurtables	9
0	no strings attached is to my memory one of the worst albums ever made no one listens to the stupid boy bands anymore this piece of c p does not sell even a thousand copies today unless the previous reviewer is buying up all the million copies himself dont buy any album from n stync or the equally horrible justin timberlake get any beatles album instead	9
0	dull and uninspiring listening to this cd i could n't see what distinguished the doves from the other insipid sound a like bands that plague the modern music scene if you like the white stripes franz ferdinand arctic monkeys the killers then be grateful that they 've saved rock music from boring dross like this	9
0	charlotte church had the most beautiful and captivating voice i ever heard when she debuted i purchased all of her albums and played them to death this cd is horrible ! her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up ridiculous ! she could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew this is simply a tragic waste of talent	9
0	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd she 's lowered herself to a brittany spears wanna be monotone songs horrible bass every song sounds the same i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music buy this one and you 're just wasting your money would the real charlotte church please come back \? \? \? \?	9
0	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album i expected a hard hitting original instead we get re arranged covers and lots of filler salsa no surprises here the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious you 'll play this one once	9
0	je suis un peu d u par cet album c'est morne le son est pas top a tra ne dans les longueurs bref ennuyeux ! mais bon il faut se mettre l' poque aussi ! a qd m me 13 ans	9
0	how can anyone say this chick has talent \? ! ! ! my god she is sooooooooo bad and yes i actually listened to it the only reason it sounds semi ok is because she 's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good ! she does n't write any of her songs and she ca n't hold a tune gives celine a run for her money \? please ! ! ! ! the only singer she sounds better than is paris hilton ! but whatever if you like it that 's all that matters if you like pretty young pop stars christina aguilera is much better she can actually sing ! !	9
0	hmm sounds good jazzy and chic this should only be played in lounges the only tracked i liked was amour the rest i wanted to close my ears too much noise	9
0	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds	9
0	this is another rip off cd 3 songs and a video do n't make this a good purchase i expect a cd to have at least 8 10 songs on it	9
0	a mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s do n't even bother	9
0	i bought the cd because i thought it was instrumental music then i hit the tracks with vocals yikes ! this is the only cd of lee ritenour that i bought i am a first time listener i must say that i do like the instrumental music very much however i really hate the tracks with vocals	9
0	i really really hate foreigner and i rank them as bad as green day dont make the mistake of buying this disgustingly awful cd which contains trash like waiting for a girl like you which has to be one of the most moronic and stupid songs ever get any led zeppelin album instead	9
0	this album contains only rap and no rock songs this was very disappointing to say the least	9
0	their new stuff is even worse but this is still sexist boring annoying music at its worst there are much better artists out there so why listen to these two untalented rappers	9
0	this is the 1 worse song of 2006 \( 2 is sexyback by justin timberfake \) for real his voice is awful and i do n't know who is worse james blunt macy gray or shakira imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage it would be pure he11	9
0	ya abomination to god also set it right in his worthy review i remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that one call away and right thurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr garbage does 2 stars explain anything \? this apparently is equal to that d4l s which is actually the lowest of the low anyways did n't i tell you chingy would die one year after jackpot hit \? now that he 's dead everybodies focused on t pain oh s !	9
0	lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort i'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from amazed syndrome amazed 's 1999 multi format mega success is spread all over this album their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville \? i'm already there comes off as very diane warren ish in its sappy lyrics their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay but these songs do n't work for them these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this	9
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am i really do n't care much for this album i say thank goodness for creep because we may have never heard from them again \( or at least not in the same way \) if that song had not become as popular as it did	9
0	i really liked this when it came ut on vinyl but in retrospect it was the cause not the music b raitt is grand g nash with an excellant cathedral j c young and the highlight to me we almost lost detroit by the great gil scott heron but the second disc is second rate edit the filler and it rates higher	9
0	generally harmless except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents the song is probably funny to ultra sophisticated cynical adults but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old i would n't bring this cd into your house	9
0	the movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack spend your money elsewher	9
0	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub par testament release testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience this is not a horrible album but compared to any other testament album it is easily their worst only the die hard testament fan or those into commercial metal should pick this up	9
0	their new stuff is even worse but this is still sexist boring annoying music at its worst there are much better artists out there so why listen to these two untalented rappers	9
0	generally harmless except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents the song is probably funny to ultra sophisticated cynical adults but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old i would n't bring this cd into your house	9
0	i'm mean i know these guys do n't have a shred of originality afterall that make some of the same crappy beats you can put together on piano 's and they just got to mess up classic songs also he 's about as good of a musician as he is an actor this country is just too unoriginal these days	9
0	anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies seriously	9
0	the music of dowland is wonderful but sting is n't up to interpreting it you ca n't even distinguish the words half the time just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor he does n't possess the skills to carry it off this music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language sting for all his merits has n't got that in his repertoire yet it 's an exercise in pretention laughable at times the letter reading is ridiculous i love both sting 's voice and dowland 's song but this cd is a failure	9
0	i ca n't believe i just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten \( ten ! ! \) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit by the third version my brain turned to jelly by the fifth i needed a drink by the final re mixed version my hangover already started to set in this e p is for dj 's and masochists only tom rya	9
0	great cd imus in the morning recommended highly and the i man was not wrong one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years i listen to a lot of buffett james taylor delbert mcclinton and this cd places high in these ranks	9
0	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	9
0	metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton as this album is prime evidence of he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here also newstead only gets one song on this album which is ironically the best song on the album in the history of metallica this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial	9
0	i received emails about delaying my order three times since it showed that the product was available i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that i am not sure how long you will survive	9
0	hooba stank stinks and will always stink i do n't know about the rest of the cd but listening to the reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal i'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn egad	9
0	after hearing i'm n luv \( wit a stripper \) i do n't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this cd in its entirety i'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this cd sucks this cd is a waste and t pain is illiterate there ! i said it in one sentence holllaaa	9
0	not exactly the vaults blowing open as stated in the promo these are mostly leftovers and one offs from the late 1990s when the group was on hiatus from serious recording that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows literary journals and graphic design firms whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected such as reprehensible rest awhile and certain people i could name but there are too few of these real songs and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long awaited b sides collection from their major label career	9
0	unfortunately i forked out 14 for this cd upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green 's previous work also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist use this as sunday background music on a rainy day but do not expect to get the party started with this album	9
0	guys it 's not that good i have the album on my computer and i gave it a few listens but it has no substance it 's not interesting or anything new it 's catchy and irritating after more than a song or two that 's all \( bandages is enjoyable once in a while i will concede \) if you 're looking for catchy and poppy \( and there 's nothing wrong with that \) then buy it if you want something new and original do n't and if you want good indie dance electronica type music go for something like the faint the bravery or le tigre	9
0	i love his voice but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted there are about 12 key changes in every song the melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs i feel these affectations detract from the songs while his vocal gymnastics are very impressive the result just is n't enjoyable to listen to \( unless you are a voice student or professional singer \)	9
0	i liked the santana steven tyler song video since i found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something i buy within reasonable means i wont buy the cd want to make sure that sony loses money in this effort will teach them a lesson i have been burned by sony 's proprietary before on other items so i will stay away	9
0	this cd is 100 pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive either if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better stop this s y music !	9
0	i got the cd with only disc 2 it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one	9
0	do not buy this cd the first two reviews said this is a good cd nope i 'll tell ya the real about this cd i believe this was 305 's first cd and i do n't see how this cd was ever in mass production while it does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist 305 got much of the material for this cd on techmaster p e b 's masterpiece bass computer any one who has both cd 's can tell if your looking for bass you 'll find it here but you can find knock with any bass artist i give this cd one star for biting techmaster	9
0	maybe its just me but the piano is out of tune badly enough that it should not have been recorded i had to force myself to finish listening to the concerto and did not even bother with the rest sad piece of work	9
0	trash and irrated plus the good albums ya 'll give them 0 's so now i'ma let the world know	9
0	although prince is an utter genious ! this cd is merely a boring contract filler i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album musicology instead	9
0	flcl is the worst anime of all time and possibly the worst thing to come out of japan since the pearl harbor attacks and the soundtrack is just as bad if not worse its nothing more than j pop mixed with bad japanese rock bad guitar playing boring drum beats and inaudible bass you 've heard one pillows song you 've heard them all only otakus with no life love this s \( like matthew g salisbury \) if you want good japanese music go for king 's evil ps that album cover is possibly the worst ever made	9
0	i was \( and still am \) a huge fan of mr show it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription it 's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created mr show produced this weak offering might be the least funny comedy cd i 've ever heard virtually all the material in the album has been done before and much better by other comedians most of the bits just lay there and die mr cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f ck a lot sorry it just does n't work do n't waste you money on this one get the mr show dvds instead and forget this ever existed	9
0	i wouldn't know i never got my cd and its been over two month	9
0	this is nothing like the classic dead you 've heard about far from it the sound is too polished quot alabama get away quot and quot althea quot are okay but the rest is junk i think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the deads' best music really the grateful dead with a polished sound \? \? just does n't seem to fit save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations plus american beauty worjing man 's dead europe '72 and quot dead set quot	9
0	sorry bill ! poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase the guitar playing is adequate but not good enough to save this material i hope bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material	9
0	first of all floetic was a brilliant album and after i heard superstar on the radio i thought flo'ology was going to be a classic too i was wrong this album lacks originality its inferior to be precise the first time i popped this cd into the system i found myself being friends with the skip forward button the length of the records is despicablethis cd is not worth having the only track that stands out for me is superstar and i think common is amazing	9
0	i 've been down for monica since the beginning but now i am finished i love monica 's voice but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers wtf ! ! ! i want the soulfoul monica from the first cd sideline ho are you serious ! ! ! again wtf ! ! could someone please come out with a soulful mature cd cause this one aint even close	9
0	i got this cd after seeing what i remembered as a decent video on fuse tv maybe i was half asleep because after listening to this ho hum entry into the world of emo copycats i ca n't even remember or recognize which song it was this album is ultimately forgettable better off listening to any jimmy eat world cd again and again which is actually an enjoyable experience	9
0	if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is n't it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is n't one of them i'm glad clapton is now in a happy place \( and deservedly so \) but this cd just does n't do it for me	9
0	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know but to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds this is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music another double ambient album seti pharos is a real masterpiece it is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning but you know never judge the cover by its album please if you have any feedback to this write to carlogiova yahoo it i would be happy to share thoughts	9
0	i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd we were barely able to make it through one listening this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist \( using the term very loosely \) not already been famous for something besides music the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating i want my money back	9
0	i should first state that i am a huge ej fan his music has been extremely important to me over the years he is without a doubt a genius i would go so far as to call him the mozart of our times but elton can also write bloated self indulgent tripe and if you ask me this album belongs in that bucket i give it 2 stars just because of ssmlt one of his all time greats i never cease to be blown away by that song but the rest of this album \? booooooring ! ! !	9
0	the second cd was scratched and hence i cannot play it i would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me thanks jeann	9
0	am i the only ones who actually liked nelly 's first album i thought it had charm style grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance you thought it mean something but this is just a lame gimmick from the start i mean there are some moments and some good songs \( including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer \) but the rest are just horrible there is nothing else about this album that i can engage with nor cared about and who cares \? country grammer was funny and good this one 's an utter disaster one of the worst albums of the decade	9
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out	9
0	look i really despise bush he 's an idiot and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree seriously the music is really not good however if you do buy it make sure you watch the dvd eh \? its got a great will farrel skit on it 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here \( ie no w by the ministry \) thats all	9
0	it is bad ! as much as i like 10 new songs this one disappointed me a lot	9
0	kate moss \? that gawddamn rollerskate song \? oh no the spoken tracks are equally repelling there is really no atmosphere to this album	9
0	this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2 right before female rappers \( there 's a few exceptions \) i hate all little kid rappers even when i was a kid i do n't like anything on this album i still got the tape and it has n't krossed my mind to even cop the cd if you like this kind of stuff or you loved jump back in the day then i guess this is for you	9
0	periodically throughout eric clapton 's solo career his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll his self titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start and his most recent offering quot reptile quot makes adult contemporary sound exciting a similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with quot backless quot quot another ticket quot and quot money amp cigarrettes quot all competing for title of clapton 's most forgetable album the country is mellow the blues are mellow and even the rockers are mellow this is easy listening for classic rock fans	9
0	the only thing you can say about today 's music is that it 's disguisting gross and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool until they get shot every copy of this cd should be burned	9
0	i got this album because obie trice did some great stuff on the 8 mile soundtrack so i figured i 'd check out what else he 'd done this album just does n't live up to that	9
0	this is anything but soothing the tone is too high pitched nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky carmel coastline that i was hoping for i did buy the twofer and got the ocean surf cd by dan gibson and found it much more relaxing even though it is n't a tumbling surf sound i was able to fall asleep which was my goal now if i could only return ocean waves	9
0	shannon lawson is capable of a much better album i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots and it was amazing ! if they were to put out a cd i'm sure it would be one of my favorites shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that 's what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd instead they gave it this generic overproduced sound leaving shannon sound like everyone else with the way bluegrass is selling these days it 's a shame that shannon could n't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena	9
0	i was a huge fan of the jam but ive grown to despise paul weller and this cd strengthens my view this is a covers cd and has n't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects with paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base with over a dozen jam compilations rarities box sets and dvd 's in the last few years since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band this album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto	9
0	first of all i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it leaving me to pick it up i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning if you buy this consider yourself warned	9
0	there is now no trace of delight left in this band all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self indulgent i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe eyed look saying their name but this cd and the cd previous \( which did have 1 tune apples with which one could smile \) does for the first time take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes first we loose the roses then the ned 's disband following that swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were	9
0	mostly bland by this time it seemed that bad was dead in the water nothing here matches the excitement of this is especially annoying are `sightsee mc ! ' `ice cool killer' and `the big v' bad goes rap \? no thanks it 's easy to see why they did the whole bad 2 thing buy the globe instead	9
0	this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville until he can make a real new album not this microwaved crapola if you like buck get straight outta cashville an beg for mercy than wait for his future release with actual new tracks i strongly advise you not to buy this it is a total rip off i wasted my time downloading this	9
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks i love the wheel but darn if this is n't just terrible there is n't even a single on it i ca n't believe the studio released it thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store the catherine wheel needs to get back together quick	9
0	with much anticipation we awaited the arrival of clay 's second album thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career while clay 's voice still sounds great the cd is an entire collection of uninspired underproduced remakes not one of which goes beyond the original as you can see this cd is nowhere on the billboard charts and we 're very sad to say in our household that it 's for good reason save your money and buy one of the much better idol cds and almost any of them are most recently kelly pickler and carrie underwood	9
0	thankfully i checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it i felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it i made it through the cd once with my kids but that was it we will not be listening again as others have said go buy the radio disney cds \( or possibly later version of kidzbop if they come with better reviews \) the singers \( kids and adults ! \) on kidzbob are out of tune and just painful to listen to	9
0	god i ca n't believe this guy ja rule was never a gangsta in his life he ca n't talk gangsta and stop trying to be like tupac tupac actually was a gangsta your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you 'd wet your pants this guy should be booted out of the game not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s as if he went through it his ruining hip hop yeah and ja stop dissing eminem and 50 you know perfectly well that they 'd kill you in a battle anyday ja rule has always been s go listen to real rap	9
0	i remember listening to this years ago and i thought i would add this to my cd library now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it very sqeaky dull slow paced stuff bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil	9
0	i agree with other reviewers do n't waste your money i should have listened to the samples to hear more awful fakes visit the producer 's web site at drewsfamous com listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase	9
0	this album is one of the best sonic youth album i advise everyone to listen this album break the circle of common popular music this album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams	9
0	i ca n't discard these songs completely because they have such potential ! clever fun lyrics great beat but boy i wish this guy could hit his notes more often ! i suppose this fellow requires the sort of pitch does n't matter mindset that grateful dead listeners perfected years ago \( or similar drugs \) i'm just not that tolerant or substance affected	9
0	i wo n't dispute emmylou 's wonderful voice and mark knopfler 's superb guitar playing but this album just did n't cut it for me pretty lame about as likely as hank and phoebe snow	9
0	this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g funk heyday warren g did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before the skits are ridiculous the music is halfass and the lyrics are amateur there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w c and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's it takes a thief one star for the hit single summertime in the l b c	9
0	i remember listening to this years ago and i thought i would add this to my cd library now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it very sqeaky dull slow paced stuff bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil	9
0	i bought this cd because i figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites well i 'd like to say i loved it but i didnt this cd just comes off as flat and lifeless where as the original songs the kyle toucher on vocals versions had a certain edge the remakes make great material sound very mediocre for those of you first discovering dr know l this may be the greatest cd in the world the material is that good but if you really want to experience dr know buy their best of cd that was released on mystic records this is the best version of dr know hope this helps	9
0	not particularly musical only 1 good track \( blues for miles \)	9
0	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson \? the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it \? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la 's lysa flores north of the border	9
0	a terrible terrible waste of money all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle head paul godfrey is face it no one gives a sh t about morcheeba anymore we 're not interested in who 'inspired' them \( poor annette peacock has anyone told her \? \) the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age old question quot paper or plastic \? quot	9
0	this is a pep rally on cd an unsingable emotionally charged pep rally it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music the melodies are not easily singable at all and the songs use all the same musical cliches this is worship manipulation at it 's best if you read the words to learn something concrete about god you will find nothing of substance they talk about actions to give god and our response to god but no meat and potatoes of why we should be doing this god is great but why \? this is very disturbing and completely unacceptable for congregational worship	9
0	a friend of mine turned me on to spoon and at first i listened enthusicatically but then i got bored although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times they are empty and deviod of any alterations the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track if this is 5 star music today our culture is severely lacking depth	9
0	i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they 're funny heh so witty anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy but there are a couple of good songs on this cd notably grand theft autumn and saturday those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho 2 stars	9
0	great recording but if you want to actually use it like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm meaning you ca n't don't buy sony products ! !	9
0	apart from the great selection of soundtracks what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing executed with finesse these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited fuller versions like singing in the rain for example throw in the great price and this double disc set is a must have for all lovers of classic movie music	9
0	after reading her excellent halloween book i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning i always search for different halloween cds but this was filled with the same old stuff chains moans and spooky laughs then more chains moans and spooky laughs very dissapointing	9
0	i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack they are horrible pieces of s ! \? ! ! there are a couple good ones but its not worth spending the money on for the c d not even at a used price i ca n't believe they did'nt put low rider on the soundtrack how cheap is that	9
0	what 's up the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune \( which i always thought would have been the perfect song for heart \) is the only thing good here the rest of this album is a mess linda perry has of course gone on to better things	9
0	i just sold this back through amazon i was so disapointed with it it 's an all cover record and while greg duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers all of the music feels too subdued too flat duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the whigs and the first twilight singers recording	9
0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song people will keep getting them for free in internet nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop pop commercial elevator music if you like that kind of music buy this cd otherwise buy hubert laws or dave valentin among others if you want to listen to good nestor music buy morning ride dance of the phoenix talk to me mi alma latina or the charanga album mis canciones primeras sorry nestor i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album	9
0	yo gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one i dunno what happpened the production seemed too generic the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all and doesnt carry much replay value to be honest id pop in a three 6 mafia cd rather than this one album was slacking on so many levels now theres some tracks that listenable but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album nothin special bout it at all this album waz overhyped i believe and flopped horribly gotti can do much better than this wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out 2 5	9
0	this album was one of my biggest mistakes \( bought it 3 years ago \) it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative rock band better you buy instead up the bracket \( the libertines \) orsome strokes stuff	9
0	with 2 cds of endless repeated chords they do n't have much to say	9
0	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here robin frequently disappears in the sound mix becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony that 's fine for a group concert like the bee gees but inexcusable for a solo effort his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act they should have kept this in the can it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin do n't do him the favor	9
0	this is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music this is ridiculous ! kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game please please please spare us and stop rapping	9
0	i just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation in this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round that song is not listed on the song track and i think it should be the song is atrevido by orishas i think this is wrong	9

0	this stuff is so boring i ca n't believe people still listen to this stuff seriously come on people ! i laugh every time i see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere plus busta has admitted to having relationships with men if you get what i mean makes you wonder about a lot of rappers	9
0	wow i can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off 1 rock and roll part ii \( gary glitter \) and 2 get it on \( t rex \) the rest has been said in the other costumers reviews	9
0	this is the album when ja officially became a b tch his first 2 albums was good i enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended i hated this s it from start to finish this is a waste of space in the cd case how can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time \? now i do n't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper but you should've at least knew him muthaf er ! another disembowelment to one of pac 's classics i stopped listenin' to ja because he made a big change not cause of 50 unlike some turncoat fans	9
0	mississippi and sugar baby are great songs up there with the best dylan has done however the rest of the album while listenable is n't all that memorable still i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still after over 40 years performing and recording the same cannot be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones overall time out of mind was better although that too was a little overrated with only not dark yet standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs	9
0	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it is n't allready i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago must have been on the album prior to this but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative do n't waste your time with this	9
0	i never could understand why the beatles are so popular \? they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds i just dont like it because it sucks ! dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below the beatles only made one good album and that 's the one which contains ballad of john and yoko hey jude	9
0	not the type of music i had envisioned much slower than i was hoping for	9
0	this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now but i'm just not feeling it the single wolf like me is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album it is a great song but everything else is just blah i think the band could use a different singer the guy they got does n't sing very well or very soulful the music is good very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews just listen to the cd before you buy it that 's my advice	9
0	i found a supposedly new remastered edition of sade 's diamond life on sale for less than 10 bucks oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it the cd store was already out of business and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as 2000 digital remastered version the whole album has been re recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator' really sucks ! !	9
0	you win some and you lose some this purchase was a definite loss what a dissapointment	9
0	these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent totally buble is not an album that i wanted to be released they were songs i recorded for a film called totally blonde many years ago before i was signed to 143 reprise records the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer and i had no control over stopping him it is important for everyone to know that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album michael buble	9
0	i got this cd because i loved their radio hits bring me to life and my immortal while those songs are beautiful they are not representative of the rest of the album although i tried and tried to get into this cd the hard rock teen goth style just is n't my cup of tea and the lyrics are too depressing if you are a fan of bands such as linkin park or seether you might enjoy this however if you only like my immortal and bring me to life because of amy 's powerful vocals you 'd be better off listening to tori amos or sarah mclachlan	9
0	i was babysitting and the kid was listening to the cd and asked why billie joe sounded so sick x	9
0	i love ray charles when ray 's doing ray this was terrible ray was out of tune out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous i'm sorry ray i love you it 's a shame this had to be one of your last cd 's	9

0	boney used to be the man but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him anyone who thinks this cd is good should listen to his older stuff like seduction trust or backbone you will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential cmon'boney lets get back to multi dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of peace	9
0	this collection is a must have if you like the bee gees and do n't have any of their albums or even if you do it 's one hit after another plus some i 've never heard which is nice for variety i could n't ask for a better collection it 's like i had burned this for myself	9
0	this album is n't not very good at all there are about four songs i like first off the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats then the guest artists do a sub par job lyrically then there are no new verses from biggie on the album they should have stopped with born again because album will be a forgotten one not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls	9
0	jj the name of the song you are looking for is like you like an arsonist by paris texas	9
0	i just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song thanks to melania for pointing out the song title at the end i realize this cd is just a soundtrack but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs it is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this cd my vote do not buy this cd the soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff but get the ending title song if you can it 's great	9
0	bands from the 90s just sucked and nirvana fits in with that they had a couple of ok songs and kurt cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about i can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were i do n't see it this is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music	9
0	etta never fails to deliver in the vocals gutteral bombast sweet soul gospel blues the lady is a living legend but this album like the last album produced by her son is a nightmare chessy arrangments tinkly bass poor sound all around she is a fierce mother and i'm sure she thinks her kids know best but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer should etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck she would n't need the novelty of some of the song choices ps 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer blues r b soul whatever in the world	9
0	all the cds this band has made suck not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made blink 182 sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk pop	9
0	there are 2 good songs on this disc stinkfist and aenema the rest are pure crap half of the tracks are n't even songs they 're just a bunch of noise no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your 14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap if you gave this cd 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely	9
0	ashlee 's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that 's she 's all plastic and no talent she must of asked the dr to make her look like her sister very sad cause she 's unrecognizable now better looking maybe still ca n't sing or dance	9
0	the people who have mentioned aphex twin and four tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists if you liked the stone roses you will like this it 's not an 'electronic' album at all i 've ordered manitoba 's earlier cd after listening to the samples \( the reason for purchasing both these albums \) and i certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'up in flames' it 's funny i promised myself i would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading either that or dan snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years	9
0	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un inititiated i am writing to confirm that assertion i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas tellingly this is the final song on the album otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times	9
0	in answer to a music fan from temple hills the song was called king holiday by the king dream chorus amp holiday crew it came out on mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned it made no 30 on the r amp b charts but did n't crossover pop the lyrics are on the net \( try google \) but i do n't know if the song still is	9
0	well i like the song i shall believe and that 's why i purchased this album but it would have been better to buy just the single	9
0	i'm sure it was fun for van to record a bunch of songs he likes but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg thanks for all the great music through the healing game all good times have to come to an end	9
0	i own this set as does my roomate and we both hate it it highlights bands like 'red lorry yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to and uses great classic bands like bauhaus' worst song as the first track it is the hollow tin y embarrassingly hokey side of goth and i am ashamed to even have it in my house	9
0	i agree complete with erik cobbett this is covenant 's most unnecessary and boring album ever there are a couple of nice parts on it but generally it 's a big disappointment	9
0	it 's loud you ca n't hear the lyrics nor the words just a lot of loud noise great if you want to damage your hearing	9
0	this was just to much country for this parrothead i liked one song piece of work and that was about it	9

0	this album is not very good i am a big fan of life in general at the show and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip but i did n't care becuase it sucked it was boring and it had no flavor not the mxpx i used to know	9
0	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak the singing is weak and the arrangements are dullsomething kicked all the life out of the music the songs are not all the same but for some reason they all sound the same and embarrassingly you can sing most of them after one listen they are so simplistic and cliched	9
0	their basically what would happen if you took p o d 's lyrics and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about god and self loathing in a noise bleed inducing pre pubescent girl voice so you have a band so bad it makes god himself want to commit suicide the song titles are also annoyingly bad obviously made so they sound artistically genius \( but instead monotonous \) and to everyone who thinks these guys are metal they deserve to be buried alive metal is fear factory lamb of god in flames and arch enemy these guys are about as metal as maroon 5	9
0	one word generic terrible boring \( well they are all one word \) people must learn to have a better taste in music granted there is at least one good song a few others are decent but only because there are no vocals if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years you have heard pulse ultra my friend likes breaking binjaman \( another uber generic rock band in my book \) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said thats enough do yourself a favor and buy a good cd when will people learn !	9
0	this is the 4th worse song to be put out in 2006 seriously this is awful very juvenile and materialistic this guy and his rented chains need to disapear what a waste	9

0	there 's nothing in this i 'd say even remotely resembles jazz it 's repetitive has a rock beat and consists mostly of licks taken from other players if you 're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room this might be a good choice	9
0	crikey ! ! ! ! what is this chunder \? wait a minute art students from down under get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of the wiggles decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base ! yeah this stuff could be the soundtrack to forrest gump alright run forrest run ! run as fast as you can from this crap ! ! ! and these guys are touring too \? are they touring with barney friends \? there is not one thing of value to this other than that the cd itself makes a handy coaster for your foster 's	9
0	the most untalented producer in the business honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit the rest of this is trash especially those chickenheads total and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass dont give this bum anymore money just listen to biggies two gems and f the rest	9
0	lol ! some people cant be serious these days the lyrics on every track are straight garbage so he failed bad lyric wise production wise some of the beats are pretty good but a beat doesnt make a song good ! nor does it make horrible lyrics good ! ! so i think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try j kwon but the game aint for you i think this album is garbage	9
0	very disappointing nothing like riverdance would not recommend and i am avid fa	9
0	bad news is that i wasted my time listening to this whinefest good news is that i bought it used i give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the cd and she is a cutie more good news i re sold it for my purchase price	9
0	quality is poor some songs are not playing avoid buying amazon	9
0	this is the cheesiest music ever phil collins glenn frey chaka khan \? are you kidding me \? these were the worst artists of the 80 's where 's u2 rem the pixies x the pretenders tom petty prince springsteen the replacements husker du \? does anyone like rock and roll \? phil collins writes songs for disney and pixar now ! what did glenn frey know about 'smugglers blues' \? do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart \? these are the worst artists songwriters and performers of the 80 's enjoy the nostalgia but the art which is song is seriously missing on this cd	9
0	just saw the video for this while flicking the song talks about london bridge going down and everything but the bridge is fixed it does n't go up or down with the video showing tower bridge so bit of a mix up there petty maybe but just thought it should be pointed out	9
0	i was so disappointed with this cd at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all ! they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler \? i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times !	9
0	i bought this in a haze of holiday optimism having heard ms aguilera knock my socks off dueting with tony bennett on a television tribute show there is no denying that the girl can sing unfortunately what she sings here is banal at best and downright irritating at worst lots of gratuitous squealing it 's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity i reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age maybe i just do n't get it then again maybe it 's just not there for me to get	9
0	bill charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented lyrcially blessed jazz pianiasts around today he has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences that told i find it very hard to give his latest effort stardust more than two stars with very few exceptions i found this cd to be fairly self indulgent and charlap rather morose in his intrepretations it was n't nearly a refeshing to the ear as written in the stars i would recommend this for a charlap devotee but no one else he has made better albums	9
0	she is not a singer she is not able to write play and read the scores music she is an entertainer ! the problem is you ca n't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years \? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls ! ps pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos ! ! ! thank god for america 's future pop artists like this one !	9
0	after norah 's first two cds and the little willie 's cd i was greatly looking forward to this release to say the least i am disappointed i was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep where is the range of work \? all of the songs on this cd sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me i'm giving it 2 stars just because of norah 's angelic voice otherwise i 'd have to give this one a 1 star rating	9
0	this great underground master dj deservedly gets a release on a major record label but there are too many rappers not enough personality in the production and obvious restraint in the sampling \( surely the result of copyright clearance issues \) compared to z trip 's amazing and audacious uneasy listening with dj p and live at the future primitive with radar this is just a bore yawn	9
0	the title says it all they could have put a better group of songs togather	9
0	i bought this cd after having seen ken burns' special on pbs the energy that came through on screen in the benny goodman segments does n't really come through in this cd artie shaw said that benny goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability that shows in this collection afterall where would jazz be if jazz musicians did n't take risks	9
0	i heard that song recently quot three strange days quot and i recalled how much i detested it when it came out overt pandering to tyros in altered states now i ca n't get it out of my head and may require a lobotomy there was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91 but this was n't part of that canon nice try school of fish have fun playing the cyo circuit	9
0	i loved shedaisy 's first album the whole shebang and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed this is a very dark and depressing album almost every song is about lost love also all the songs but 1 are slow where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with \? \? \? i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again still i look forward to what the future may bring from them these sisters have alot of talent	9
0	this was o k nothing more nothing less this album was hard to review beacuse no songs really stick out i mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes laced over just above mediocre beats i have heard better sesame street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van i mean what does the album have that sticks out \? saturday to saturday \? bloody horseshoe \? or the multi faceted boo we ai n't forgot about you none of the above or none on the album sorry and please all angry people who think that this is a bad review remember it 's a review i can say what i want	9
0	though these are the songs that make the mills brothers famous they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals \( certainly they are considerably older \) these are ok but they lack the punch and familiarity \( to a fan like myself \) of the originals the title though not actually misleading leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs they are not i recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills brothers records	9
0	me especially i cannot hate on cam cuz i got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s to say and judgin that his subject matter stays the same i guesss its true dude spits some retarded a lyrics i give this cd a two cuz of the beats but this dude is a certified beatwaster these producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars this n a sumtimes do n't even rhyme	9
0	do not buy this cd he is definitely wack his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats as a member of children of the corn he was weak and he still is weak the other member of his dip set crew outshine him on his own cd how lame is that through away any cam'ron cd 's you own and immediately replace them with music by jay z	9
0	it has been nearly three months and i have yet to receive the subject michael henderson cd amazon should not be offering this item for sale if they do not have access to a supplier	9
0	so this is the winner of plop idol from the u k then well they do n't come prettier than this from scotland i guess that 's for sure as far as the music is concerned avoid ! it 's nothing but a calchony of crap perhaps michelle should stick at something she is good at eating chips and mars bars	9
0	don`t waste your time and money on this compilation what a cheap shot to take the consumers money read the very fine print it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it shame on the distributor !	9
0	when mike the mechanics ushered in the `madchester' scene with the living years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon if you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads ! verdict do n't waste your money	9
0	i listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band i did n't like this one one bit but than again it was also for my husband i definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music	9
0	this is as bad as the film in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula will amp his movies amp music never change the same old beat the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad unoriginal amp boring what a waste of kool moe dee	9
0	this is no saw 85 92 as some people compare it to oh no this is a largely unfulfilling listen the tracks all sound too similar i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear but the drum programming and harmonic development is lackluster only track worth burping over is the last one xmd something has he been taking piano lessons since druqks \? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch check out nick forte 's new release young man 's disease which is better than anything else i 've heard this year	9
0	nothing even close to say no more i'm sorry i spent the mone	9
0	this a great priced cd but the content is why it is so cheap it 's a true amateur album beethoven lover is over her his head this is the real world not a fantasy everyone likes every type of music world deal with it and agree with me it is n't so great	9
0	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit elefant 's lyrics i personally like interpol and the strokes i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs	9
0	i agree fully with quot a music fan quot above this and david 's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work i love most of talking heads music but do n't rate remain in light highly like most fans do	9
0	who could like a band like the rolling stones \? they are not the world 's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but start me up and shattered their new album is the most horrible cd i have ever heard stay far away from that cd get anything from the stones that contains start me up or shattered insted	9
0	i ususally like aguilera and i need a song to practice for dance so i bought this one for no other man figuring i would like the other songs as well i was so wrong i hate the rest of them	9
0	this completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original overblown overproduced mackintosh garbage if he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage i'm sure he would n't have hesitated mr banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst and the omission of sister suffragettes smacks of pc nonsense	9
0	i bought this cd for the avril lavigne song keep holding on i really like her song and this is the only way i could find to buy get it was to buy the eragon sound track i havent seen the movie besides that i would n't have bought it	9
0	in general i'm a big fan of movie music but to tell the truth i expected more from this one this soundtrack is incomaparable to say lord of the rings or star wars movie music it lacks depth and emotion and power unlike emotionally potent melodies present in lotr soundtrack the eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting i get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called eragon i get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track i hope they 'll make better album for the next movie of the inheritence trilogy	9
0	it might not be a good album but it definitely shows shania 's potential	9
0	i loved her first album but this one is the same old same old rehashed time and time again she has reached her limits i'm afriad	9
0	long studio sessions if you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way then this is it if you do n't get near the beginning or rock roll get some of their quality stuff this definitely is n't it	9
0	well unless you are a hardcore collector like myself \( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago \) stay clear of this album if you want to hear noise that you your wife girlfriend boyfriend could do yourself then forget this album make your own noise the best track on the album is the bonus track that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging \) search judemac forever on msn	9
0	atleast they are trying this time around still no where near as good as the band was with max pros faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without max at the helm guitar playing is passable cons lack of solos derrick is still lacking as a vocalist just is n't as good as old sepultura songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable bottom line this album falls short of expectations the current sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best if you like old sepultura i suggest you not waste your money on this but then again you might like it buyer beware	9
0	i'm a huge fan of christopher lawrence 's stuff but i aboslutely refuse to buy this cd because of the copy protection i do not pirate music and should be allowed to copy music i purchase onto my mp3 player of choice this is just sad	9
0	for fans i suppose this would be a rather big delight for non fans it 's nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey they had some okay cheesy hits in the '80s but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays	9
0	i guess i was expecting more of a ferrante and teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time could be that it is but if so am missing depth great family but disappointing albu	9
0	unfortunately ttd went off the deep end on this album consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album quot symphony or damn quot and the superb follow up quot vibrator quot if you loved the first album give this one a miss and get the two i just mentioned come on ttd hurry up and release a new album	9
0	i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd a system i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing and the mix to be a bit over the top with surround effects major vocals coming from rear speakers etc i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk in fact the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song let 's get it on and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection if you are looking for dvd a disks with 5 1 surround i 'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album	9
0	bits of beatles zappa queen \( herman 's hermits \? \) may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator elfman 's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal musical pieces they have fairly banal repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music has the creepy competence of a dave grusin album if you like that you 'll be ok here	9
0	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music singing sucks this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock if you think i'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice he can't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush he sucked atcountry and has no place in rock home boy go back to texas andget back to branded some cows cause you suck	9
0	yeah i am a big fan of moby and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise but fail to build up to anything everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style which were almost humorous except not this much money humorous i am not a fan of this cd i know he was starting out in a punk band but his other stuff is much bette	9
0	do yourself a favor and only buy his albums they 're much more solid one love peace	9
0	if you 're looking for billie in her prime look elsewhere all the music on this cd was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice look for the classic recording of strange fruit from '39 on one of the other cds available	9
0	this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock if you 're a fan of this type of music i recommend this cd but if not do n't buy it there are only a few good tracks all star bad reputation i'm a believer stay home and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1 3 of it is good so i would n't buy it if i were you	9
0	\( \) this cd is sub par most of the beats are cool but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics	9
0	i like meav 's voice and this cd is ok if you like this kind of stuff think slow and somewhat depressing i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times and came up with this vocal sound i guess to hark back to earlier times which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music this is all a bit samey and dull i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though	9
0	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong i click on one song and get another from on the list what gives anyway	9
0	i ordered this cd based on the reviews first i have to say that i am not sure why it is called 'paris under a groove' i was thinking that it would be in french at least the beats are nice i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar i just was n't as thrilled as i thought that i would be it sounded very cheap no originality my fiancee is from paris and this was very disappointing not only to him but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present so far it sits on the shelf	9

0	i was overall disappointed by this cd there are many good reviews here but they generally overpraise tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears a major highlight is track 9 the crab and the egret but interestingly the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous chinese percussion disappointingly the cd is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment	9
0	i do n't see the comparison to jeff buckley at all ! that was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album all the songs are much too similar the guy 's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and if you remember london suede has a very similar sound to them \( though i will say that london suede was much better \) no one has come close to the pipes of j buckley \( or even tim b for that matter \) in years and this does n't count any where near that either	9
0	is it really necessary to take minute long solos in every song \? really \? if you like your solos long winded and lacking in destination and your lyrics trite \( get a job \? \? \? \) check these guys out if you actually plan on listening to the music you buy skip it	9
0	ac dc is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time but they are not growing as musicians sure they can rock like they used too but they seem to be out of ideas the well is dry put out a anthology already ! ! ! at least my favorite band deep purple keep coming up with good stuff and with imagination ! the fact that purple 's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber anyway better luck next time angus co stiff upper lip ac dc 2 stars	9
0	as much as i like most of the songs on this cd it 's just too short also the production is lousy the recording quality sounds awful in places hopefully the updated compilations are better this one is not worth the money ! ! !	9

0	i hate the beatles they are amongst my music guide top 20 worst bands ever they only made a few decent songs in hey jude let it be and ballad of john and yoko rest of their songs just stink ! even a mark knopfler cd without dire straits is better than this ! like i said anyone who listens to the beatles or zeppelin don't know what good music is about huh ! ! ! good music is required dire straits green day foreigner gnr metallica and nirvana get any album from those bands insted the beatles suck ! ! ! !	9
0	i have to admit i expected a lot more from mr setzer the first track was ok then it proceeded to go down hill from there not much rockabilly happening then it all comes clear with really rockabilly when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans world wide he even gives us aussies a serv even though i do n't think he has ever set foot here if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing jazz rock or whatever then go ahead but why slag your old fans \? it 's the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first	9
0	after really enjoying the amici forever album i went shopping for another amici album and found this one there really is no comparison between the two i 've tried listening to it several times to see if i'm missing something but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe i was very disappointed	9
0	who in the world called this ''hard rock'' \? ! \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? ! ! \? this is a bunch of self pitying mainstream jibberish nothing interesting at all i shall dub this as ''alternative whine''	9

0	is this the same kool keith that created dr octagon dr dooom and black elvis \? quot spankmaster quot represents a regression of creative energy it sounds like keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks it contains little of the genius of his earlier cds with the exception of a couple songs \( quot jewelry shine quot and quot blackula quot \) this album stinks	9
0	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical a better alternative would be to listen to either a \) the original artists who influenced this bandorb \) someone at least trying to do something new with music to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super cool reputation if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry you 're not	9
0	as others have noted this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in spanish sung by maria del rey plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men \( not very good for putting a baby to sleep \) plus the whole thing repeated in english in addition i had been looking for traditional latin american pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary do n't waste your money i'm planning on giving my copy away if i can figure out someone i know who could actually use it	9
0	outside of 'curious' sung by tina cousins this album is a dud at least by 'believe' standards most songs sound similar with the same beat the album wo n't make your ears bleed but the band should have quit calling itself '4 strings' after the departure of vanessa it is a very different band now and should not tease 'believe' fans into thinking another 4 strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released i would buy 'curious' if it can be purchased separately but would skip buying this album if a future reviewer knows where vanessa ended up please let me know the mixers of the group are talented but vanessa was the real star	9
0	after reading glowing reviews of the dbts i picked up three of their cds while some of the lyrics are strong the songs have no melodies whatsoever most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer they 're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of skynyrd and the allmans but those bands were n't just loud guitars they had memorable tunes and great singers dbts are a huge letdown	9
0	sounds like it should be in a meg ryan romantic comedy did they intentionally try to erase his personality \? sounds like it was produced in nashville ! this should be a demo for another singer to record it 's just too schmaltzy for me i think phil ramone may be slipping too billy is a much better singer than this after listening to this song i instinctively lit a match i'm going to go listen to glass houses	9
0	i have all 5 volumes and this is the only one i do n't like the selection of music is just plain bad there are a few songs that are ok but most are just dull dull dull i recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead	9
0	as a contemporary of joan baez \( age wise \) i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice i even empathize with much of her politics but unfortunately it 's time she rested on her laurels her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs and her earlier quality like some professional athletes she seems to not know when to quit	9
0	being a huge blondie fan i want to rate this one higher but sadly i cannot it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs it feel very negligant too i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco but their calypso number on this one is so awful they had lost it here check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat	9
0	you 'll find better works out there particularly if you 're a miles fan the emphasis here is on milt jackson and his vibraphone which gives the album a light airy feeling missing is much of miles' horn and sentiment you also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music i would call this a quot pleasant quot album which in my jazz world is not a happy thing	9
0	actually garth hudson the former organist of the band does not play on this cd \( nor 'every geriatric rockstar 's' \) the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins messina	9

0	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc was n't worth the effort i'm afraid velveeta on wonder bread dull collection of acid jazz duds not bad as background noise for your next dinner party but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act a pass for all but galactic completeists if such an animal exists	9
0	okay here is the major problem with this release it is not a tuffgong island release the marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time because bob 's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that american and european recording artists have enjoyed for decades his recordings have gone onto the cheap market \( flea markets push carts gas stations etc and now amazon \) buying one love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the jamaican economy look closely at the albums before you buy them find out what label has produced them and try to stick with tuffgong when possible	9
0	i agree with the other negative review below uninspired simply forgettable radio trash cliched lyrics \? check muddy simple riffs \? check boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks \? check thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself judging from all the positive reviews however it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves \( if they 're still around i hope not \) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music	9
0	i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel 's the stranger at the same time after listening to the stranger my mouth dropped billy 's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction then i put in boston and could n't tell a difference from the cd version i already own i think it 's one of the best albums but if you already own it on cd do n't bother upgrading there 's nothing special about the sacd version	9
0	camera obscura is similar in an inferior manner to nico of the velvet underground nico the band makes pleasantly dull chamber pop in the vein of belle sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years even their name is ripped off of nico 's last studio album camera obscura but as i said before camera obscura is much worse than nico if you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like pick up chelsea girl nico 's first solo album	9
0	someone suggested i listen to this because i was at the time into what lame beret wearing record store dips would call creatively aggresive music then it was death metal \( which i prefer without cursing or filth you understand \) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full on unmitigated hardcore anyway mr bungle tepid uninteresting bland stupid gives the chin strokers something to fascinate over let them someone 's got the fuel the economy	9
0	whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey \( or peter lang \) is puzzling to say the least but credit where credit 's due it 's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant	9

0	it 's always good to see an artist change and try new things back in 2003 when jewel did it was a big deal everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her best i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u was also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd goodbye and i must say it 's jewel slowly regaining her musicality also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well	9

0	there 's nothing outrageous about the title song it 's a lame mind numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the in the zone album imagine breathe on me touch of my hand or shadow on constant radio play or running on mtv and no we 're not apparently going to have that because britney 's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it like we know ended up in britney 's injury for nothing fortunately for this single it 's got the already legendary toxic and a marvelous vocal mix version of everytime another star for that	9
0	i read several different on line reviews for this cd before i purchased it each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature strange i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her like my title line to this review states it 's the exact same music she has always sang just in a different package now the cd just collects dust what a shame	9

0	hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they do n't mention is that it 's impossible to listen to there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of there are no songs it 's just a sound collage or something from start to finish the booklet prints lyrics but i could n't find 'em this music is too brilliant for its own good and you can forget about using it as party or background music jdub 's other offerings are much better	9
0	i received a cd the tango cd \( the best tango album in the world ever \) was defectuous since it plays alright until the 12th song but then the songs starts giving weird tones and the 2nd cd acts the same way since my tango album is a double cd the problem is not from the radio since my other purchase from amazon is in good shape as al my other cds the music always stops playing right at the same time of the cd the 12 th song so its pretty much a cd problem i dunno whats the refund policy or customer service number its so bad cos this tango cd is great i enjoyed it much until th	9

0	just be sure to read up on this closely it 's not the orchestra you hear in the movie and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts gone are great talents enya and annie lennox replaced by no name voices this is not bad music but do n't think you 're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2 cd set	9

0	paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music however content on his latest project white sand is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums the artist collaborations on white sand make it tempting to purchase but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility \( smooth latin or r b \) are lacking overall it is still a cd worth paying for	9
0	i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody \( name changed due to copyright issues \) on their 2006 live album live in canada i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however	9

0	quot modern quot usually sounds like some outdated mid 80s new wave album by the cars flock of seagulls or somesuch it is not a punk record mostly midtempo pop the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful shelley 's are considerably better the usual wry lyrics and great hooks i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff newbies should buy quot operator 's manual quot or quot going steady quot or dig up the amazing quot different kind of tension quot from a used record store somewhere ! also see them live if you have a chance	9
0	i think they should place a disclaimer at the top advising would be buyers that rosemary clooney does not perform on this cd it lacks the romance and magic without her i wish i had read the reviews of this cd before purchasing it but i was so excited to see the white christmas soundtrack on cd that i just one clicked it	9
0	as a 21 year old i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack but i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney 's parts were not sung by rosemary clooney ! i do not recommend buying this album enjoy the music when you watch the movies instead trust me it 's better that way	9
0	this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums he is the king of electric blues you can hear all these songs in great format just awsome playing awsome singing its sure no wonder srv and hendrix really loved albert king	9
0	i am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist this cellist tone is so powerfull and clear she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull the apres un reve was ok i guess she really should of tooken more time like floating on a dream cloud when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure the elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre	9
0	she does sound like a goat bleating yodeling it 's a shame really	9
0	i was literally horrified when i first put this album in my cd player this cd is absolutly terrible every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent they 'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing do not i repeat do not purchase this album i was expecting some cool fun funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious the only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster	9

0	made another bull album honestly i did n't hear this whole album about 5 years ago i was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd oh my god for the first time in my life i wished i was deaf i see the reason why her albums sell though cause its her looks and nothin else she 's not ugly at all to me she just ca n't sing but she can livin up a crowd i'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together two of the worst people in music millionaires go figure	9
0	this album lacks a lot of the controversy \( not all of it \) of the original uncensored quot cop killer quot \( new censored version now titled body count \) go to ebay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the 92 album you will like it a hell of a lot better	9
0	this was for a friend and i have no feedbac	9
0	vote this one off the island 19 overproduced prog tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping chanting and grunting sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by phil collins it 's all supposed to convey the drama intrigue and relevance of a tv show \( survivor yell mud bath chase race tally the vote i can see it buzzed \) with no drama intrigue and relevance a desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television	9
0	the only reason i picked up this album was the name norah jones i was expecting to hear her at the forefront and i did n't really to be honest i was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in come away with me and feels like home if you 're looking for norah jones this is n't really the album you 're looking for	9
0	this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now why ca n't people my age stop copying the past \? be original that 's it this style is well worn out	9
0	if you are buying this because you love rob be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat if you are n't familiar with this incarnation let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame same guy different sensitivity i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there on this outing rob has met the enemy and it is himself he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it this cd is not an acquired taste it is a forced feeding	9
0	this lifts your heart to god as you listen beautifully done	9
0	all of the songs are boring i hate them they are slow and boring and they make you want to fall asleep	9
0	do n't waste your money this album is cheesy sounds like a million other pop rock songs and is nothing compared to their earlier work with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals all i have to say is they need the old lead singer back ! the guitar work is ok but the classic 38 special sound has definitely been lost	9
0	this album sounds to much like pop music than hardcore reggaeton they even have that rbd boyband in this piece a few years ago lt saved reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even grandmas like and that is scary the only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel de la ghetto songs if you wanna hear some real reggaeton look for producers like dj memo meka mambo kings dj wassie dj fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin reggaeton calle my friend	9
0	like so many new age artists ryan farish has a great ear for melodies unlike most new age artists ryan farish has rhythmic problems he likes to use the delay effect on his piano but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing \( sometimes it 's one problem and sometimes it 's both \) i do n't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album also the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly	9
0	2nd time	9
0	this album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts the music is simple and straightforward and the rapping is poor	9
0	being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times this cd has nothing new to offer there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past 10 years what 's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover \? nothing i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time been there done that bored to tears	9
0	the quality of this cd recording sounds like someone tapped it in their garage and burned it to cd with thier personal pc very bad recording it 's too bad because lathleen madigan is very witty and funny	9
0	somehow not up to her earlier work the instrumental accompaniment is good but tends to dominate at the expense of cesaria 's voice and the songs do n't strike me as particularly memorable one reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she 's done if so i just do n't see it i was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her i hope not	9
0	as a huge counting crows fan i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them right up until the time that i listened to the cd it is nearly impossible to get through the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke i rated it one star because there 's no 0 star option if you have any intentions of buying this cd find a website where you can preview it first and thank me later	9
0	if you do n't have the blues this record will give them to you musically speaking it 's tripe	9
0	i bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of george orwell 's book came out simply because it was attached to the movie i 'll try not to use any non family words here but this soundtrack sucks muldowney 's original score is available on cd and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie as far as this soundtrack goes though skip it	9
0	this disc is bad ! ! ! right at the 2 mark the sound of the rock water is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub this sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour other discs of this type that i 've heard do n't do this	9
0	i opend the cd filled with joy till it started at the beginning i thought there should be some kind of mistake but no there were no letters not even one word we could n't sing at all we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing	9
0	i do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars his voice is so mediocre that i am suprised he manages to sell many cd 's at all i would n't waste my hard earned cash on this guy stick with sinatra and get the best if not and you want someone who can sing sinatra style then i would recommend you listen to the young canadian michael buble in my opinion michael buble is a much better singer that tyrell he can swing and do justice to that genre of music	9
0	i am wondering when this plague will be over and when we 'll be set free to listen to real music we all are so tired of her	9
0	e40 is the worst mc i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard how on earth can someone like him get a record contract and sell records anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are i always skip the track	9
0	this disk is truly as bad as nitin 's previous disks were wonderful take any previous nitin disk throw in some alpha a bit of craig armstrong some predictable eco freindly american diatribe mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy as with most prophesies there no good news about it my prophesy is that anyone who buys this wo n't ever buy another nitin dis	9
0	i said i was going to be honest in all reviews and yes i kinda clunkered on this one i hate this cd simply put they ca n't sing and the songs are boring i'm sorry i bought this cd and other people might not like me saying that but it 's my opinion i listen to power metal extensively and there is much better stuff out there like symphony x nightwish or sonata artica do n't buy this though you might like it i 'd definitely listen to it first	9
0	listening to this cd took me back to my growing up years i remembered all their songs i loved back then it 's a great homecoming	9
0	this is nothing compared to their ep which was great by the way songs lack of inventive arrangements and feeling maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued but no more	9
0	nothing new here i like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love patton this cd is dull suffering from patton overexposure maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album \( like secret chiefs 3 book of horizons \) rather than dozens of merely adequate ones	9
0	reba is not country anymore period ! ! this cd will prove that just listen to the first track which i think is horrible as a matter of fact i think the whole cd is horrible not deserving of reba 's talent	9
0	look as music goes variations on a theme is part of any genre this album however yells out quot leave well enough alone quot a remix of sgt peppers lhcb might thrill a person born in 1986 but when you hear the real thing you ask why change it \? this album is a total waste of a truly great disc like gipeto said to pinocchio quot stay wood ! quot	9
0	there was only one good song on the disk dont waste your mone	9
0	sucks if you like this album you are a poser that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal one guy i know that listens to norma jean as i lay dying and unearth called me emo for listening to acid bath how stupid can you be \? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal such as morbid angel darkthrone amon amarth old sepultura and dissection	9
0	if you want to get into blind melon very quick buy this if you really like blind melon and wnat to hear something new do n't buy this	9
0	i sorta of agree with the person below this album sucks plain and simple however i think he is still doing a great job in rhapsody i gave it one star not so much because it is garbage but becuase i was looking forward to this album since prophets of the last eclipse which was great but trully i do n't know went wrong i do n't have a problem with female vocalists but in this album it is retched i do n't think i will ever listen to this album ever again sorry ! but its true do not buy this album pretend you never knew he had a new album oh ! and do not buy luca turilli 's dreamquest either ! another bomb	9
0	save your money on this one it 's sooooooo bland with no jams ! what a disappointment can i get a refund	9
0	just another cd of the awful awful techno crud that has infested goth industrial clubs while real artists like cinema strange and knifeladder get the shaft worthless on every level	9
0	these covers are pretty bad some good ones have been done cameron mcgill the uncommon ground tribute big sir 's everybody here wants you is good but this is bad no matter what entertainment weekly 's review might say avoid buy a real jeff or tim album	9
0	when i played the first composition on this cd i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping but after that this cd is disapointing to me there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd joyce cooling could have made one good cd but in my opinion there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd joyce certainly has potential but she needs to work on her creativity she sound here like an artist still maturing in style	9
0	this is definitely not a bad collection but there are so many better ones out there that this should not be your first choice the song sweet emotion has been completely destroyed on this album the entire bass intro has been cut out and the song starts about an entire minute into it there really is no reason to do this as even on the radio they play the entire thing as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long the song starts at a terrible place too it sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song then just stuck it on the cd that way again not a terrible compilation but definitely not a good first choice	9
0	the cat carol is the most depressing christmas song i have ever heard not to ruin the ending for you but the cat dies ! did n't exactly put me in the holiday spirit	9
0	i think ms hewitt misses the mark yes for an actress turned singer she 's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal \? i think not same goes for the other latin jennifer	9
0	based on the reviews for this cd i decided to buy it without having sampled it big mistake i love among others marshall crenshaw don dixon and peter holsapple but what happened here \? this was so not fabulous	9
0	while the title cut with joe public was bumping most of this disc is so so amp formula driven without teddy riley the grooves amp vibe are n't as strong	9
0	sorry to say i'm not a huge fan of tanghetto even after seening them play live at la viruta last month few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while i say if you want neuvo tango try narcotango or otro aires	9
0	after discovering and loving the sound of gotan project i was shopping around for groups with a similar sound i stumbled along emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd i thought i had found another gem boy was i wrong the first track drew me in and left me spellbound unfortunately it was all downhill after that i was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on the rest of the songs were so uninspiring the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise	9
0	there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah but the rest of the cd left me cold i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them it would have been better ! i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy	9
0	i have followed bruce hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert dvds i was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other but if you have been to hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh no exception here i loved the dvd of some of his performances there are treasures here imagine solo on the piano at an awards show the star spangled banner at the world series with marsalis and his performance with bb king it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan	9
0	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again it was my first time and probably my last liz snyde	9
0	i like a little bit of it doesent mean its good i wont throw it away or anything ill just let it sift wait and look at the album cover most of the time slayer is getting better though	9
0	the worst christmas album i ever heard i just bought it played it once and will never play it again	9
0	the songs are boring the lyrics are plain i am so dissapointed i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me andrea 's solo album sucked now this ! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc	9
0	i'm a big fan of great big sea and i purchase everything they release apparently they were trying to give this cd the feel of a live medium size venue performance unlike their other live dc offerings this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro cassette tape in some fan 's front pocket it does n't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound overall i was pretty disappointed and i 'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one	9
0	being a fan of jack johnson i thought this one would be as good as the others i was n't impressed at all it sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement the recording quality has very little production value at best these are okay live versions of usually great songs this is an unnecessary piece for your jack johnson collection	9
0	the music for the soundtrack was so lame ! i though i was gonna cry cause i figured this was the end of b2k by this point the s'track was n't even all b2k either i like the song with jhene and omarion happy also i liked out of the hood other then that it was boring	9
0	only way you are gonna like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk and you think that 'll make you cool this cd just does n't display musical talent maybe originality but this is not high quality music	9
0	i found the music rather annoying it was not what i expected at all	9
0	the raising arizona part of the cd is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that i remember from the movie i recommend listening to samples before you buy	9
0	knuff respect to public enemy they are one of the few groups in hip hop history who 've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics with that said this single blows it 's trash the beats are trash chuck d and flavor flav do n't rap the dvd is just them hanging out in some clubs it 's a shame legends such as public enemy are far above this remedial single if you want to hear their best worx go and buy fear of a black planet or it takes a nation of millions to hold us back you wo n't be dissapointed	9
0	we read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper we \( my husband three kids 14 10 and 5 \) tried it on a warm spring evening in the car one or two songs like the banana splits speed racer and scooby doo were fun most however were harsh and too fast for the parents and youngest guy i would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers	9
0	i have been a nin fan since pretty hate machine i think trent reznor is a brilliant musician all of his previous albums have been absolute genius until this \? i pre ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece what a disappointment ! ! i still ca n't get over how terrible this album is ! the only song that is worth mentioning is you know what you are that 's the trent i know ! i purposely skipped the tour just so i did n't have to hear the new stuff ! i hope this is n't it for him but i will be cautious when the next album comes out	9
0	this cd has some good songs on it but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected they are mixed together and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs buy this but i would n't recommend it otherwise	9
0	i bought this cd for one song quot walk away quot which was one of their best known songs i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems there was n't the rest of the album is like an anti climax i would suggest a greatest hits instead if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	9
0	collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage the main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers ! its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again	9
0	i love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable gimme earth or sunno \) \) \) anyday	9
0	so far so good so what ! \( in it 's origional form \) used to conjure feeling the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did n't quite hit the nail on the head if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s get your hands on that version	9
0	this is not i repeat not five stars ! in all honesty it 's more like 1 5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug atmosphere albums like overcast godlovesugly the felt project and the dynospectrum album is much better than this though the lyrics are thought provoking but slug has been better the production does n't hold up it 's some of the weakest i 've heard from rhymesayers there 's only a couple tracks that stand out but i 'd have to say do n't ever f king question that is the best if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album slug spits classic verse after classic verse	9
0	i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour again the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again i find most of this album to be very average actually after listening this album is not very good at all the majority of the songs are clich ridden in both music and lyrics there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably safe in new york city which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic probably one of the bands weakest efforts	9
0	do you love on eagles wings \? if the answer is yes then do you know the words to panis angelicus \? the answer is probably no i do n't blame you for liking this cd the problem is that it is n't catholic and it is n't classic you should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years if you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass start with sacred songs by bocelli or simply baroque by yo yo ma	9
0	thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he 's a dumb phony who does n't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dose n't even scratc	9
0	i have been listening to military band music for years and am rarely disappointed however this compendium of music by the u s navy army and marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste many of the arrangements are strange and there is much too much vocal music when what i want to hear is the bands play i would not have bought this album hhad i known beforehand what i know now	9
0	i like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while i'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax this cd just did n't fit there are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast upbeat or there 's too much talking chanting i found myself distracted when i put this cd on	9
0	i was very disappointed that the version of quot paper roses quot included on this cd is an updated and new recorded version from 1990 it is not the original 1973 classic marie recorded when she was twelve interestingly this new version is produced by sonny james the original producer of the original single that also features many of the original studio musicians so all is not lost still i prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this cd included an updated quot paper roses quot	9
0	lou reed rocks ! ! ! dude ! ! but methinks this collection dost not the tunes are all good but there are n't very many of them and the sound is deplorable in that inimitable rca first cd edition sort of way \( fans of the jefferson airplane and harry nilsson know what i'm talking about \) a much better jumping off point would be quot different times lou reed in the 70 's quot or even better check out quot transformer quot or quot rock 'n' roll animal quot	9
0	if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise this one 's for you however dont expect it to change your life much the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche you get what you pay for	9
0	deep lyrics man i'm getting a lot out of this but just wait for the next record when you 'll get quot hold on loosely ! quot	9
0	i did n't listen the disk but know the recording label never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when i was hooked by the low price very poor immitations just go for the real things	9
0	this is simply a transfer of the lp master done when cds were just getting started the quality is inferior to other collections and the selection is weaker go for the collectables twofer instead much better sound and more cuts	9
0	this disc was simply a waste of my time very mediocre songs heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent corey 's voice is below average i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career and not doing it very well clearly 'fake it till you make it' is n't working here the songs all sound the same i kept waiting for something to get me grooving but it just did n't happen i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential he either needs voice lessons a little humility and some professional grooming \( and i do n't mean clothing \)	9
0	buddy holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th century masters series every one of the cds in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous this one is no exception look elsewhere	9
0	i bought this because a few people had put it in their amazon lists i just did n't like it at all it is one of those albums where you play it and you do n't take notice of it until the cd stops playing it is very old and the music is simplistic cool cover though	9
0	one good song of course the sound of silence and the studio version is far better than this one i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect	9
0	while i love billie in her own words these sessions were dull and uninspired since the reviews should focus on one cd that is the jist of it boring renditions and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection	9
0	this cd while full of nice music is to me rather pointless it 's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie \? aside from crazy train	9
0	this cd had the makings of a great recording the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch please record another one but leave popper at home he 's full of a lot of things but talent is n't one of them	9
0	about half the songs are great old songs i'm familiar with the other half are songs made famous by other artists and most are clangers for elvis that are painful to listen to	9
0	well ok mehldau 's arrangements are n't bad he does a great version of paranoid android but otherwise where's the energy \? there 's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album and i do understand this as being a more laid back mellowed out album but it is still possible to be more exciting energetic or emotional in this style all three of these things are pretty much absent from this cd which ends up making it dull yawn	9
0	sinceramente no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas incluso renombrados artistas hacia este musico ungido de la leyenda grape amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados lastima piedad curiosidad no se me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson \( 13th \) en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio en fin son opiniones nada mas	9

0	these guys are not artists they are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene it 's like a few monkeys build a house and all the other monkeys rave about it but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat whatever that means i am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere	9
0	i do n't even own this cd and after seeing the reviews i do n't want it 90 of the 5 star reviews are people with only one review suspicious \? \? look for yourself it 's right there to see i have some other meditation cds that are very repetitive i'm not going to make the same mistake here especially with such shameless self promotion	9
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to	9
0	did not care for the selections on this cd	9
0	golijov 's music incorporates jewish arabic christian afro brazilian and other ethnic influences ad nauseum so what \? listening to this disc is like having dental work done without novocaine only diversity nazis who want to smugly bask in their own enlightened weltanschauung will find much to enjoy here golijov cunningly caters to these folks' taste may he ride it all the way to the bank	9

0	to those of you interested in this cd in lieu of finding the quot songs with lyrics quot in the movie ice age got bad news for you they are not here ! i really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they do n't include the best or features songs in the movie anyway the song that pretty much everyone wants when manny sid diego and the baby are together and walking towards half peak is called quot send me on my way quot by rusted root it is on their latest album quot when i woke quot put rusted root in the amazon search engine and you should find it hope this helps those looking for this song	9
0	i was looking to get the dvd of dazed and confused but got the cd when it was advertised on the amazon website it led me to believe that it was a dvd as you see it above \( 1993 film \) i had to return it and my expense very disappointing transaction with amazon threfore i am not impressed	9
0	i was expecting it to have a lot of international type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original i think i may have mistaken this cd title for another of shania 's her music is great but i do n't see a difference with the international version	9
0	this cd should have been called the most annoyingly overplayed songs of the 1990 's with the exception of shine every single track on this cd is juvenile mindless fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream ! if you 're looking for a cd that represents the greatest music of the 1990 's check out non stop 90 's rock or forever 90 's instead however you might be interested in this cd if you want to host a cheesy 90 's dance party the songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation	9
0	this cd shocked me at first i was listening and enjoying the beats on every track but then listening to the actual content of each song b tch this and h e that come on as a young female how am i supposed to bump this in my car \? every single song on the cd is disrespectful you know what really makes me mad this is what 's supposed to be hot popular what kind of message is this sending to our young black men \? our young women \? i would not recommend this for any one especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman	9
0	the remix is totally devoid of any taste first the vocals are completely off the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings secondly there is absolutely no respect on part of the mixing djs for the great vocalists there is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling together' of the music with the vocals i was deeply disappointed with this cd if you are into remixes get the rod stewart do ya think i am sexy single cd instead	9
0	i was very disappointed with this volume the past 2 volumes had great retro loungy mixes and this new one is too repetitive and clubby i was excited to see the postal service doing a mix however it sounded just like any of their other songs this cd sucks	9
0	some of the songs here are good most notably never be forgotten beautiful i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing herein lies the problem the song is good the voice is good but if she sounds like faith or martina there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there add to this that this is mostly bubble gum pop and not country there 's really nothing that stands out here why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there \? that 's the question	9
0	if the name pink floyd was n't on this cd who would really rate it higher that one or two stars \? i am a pink floyd fan but i have to say that i do n't like any of their early works to me the band begins to make great stuff with meddle and their first cd were boring even with the pink floyd name on it the only good track is childhood 's end the other tracks are poor	9
0	mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend this kind of crap could n't even sell a can of coke these days choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches i hear scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found but scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie	9
0	sorry guys i think that the cover says it all totally out of focus and falling apart i much prefer his later work	9
0	you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck exceptfor ken nordine he is a god in spoken word i wished i would have bought two coppiesone to poop on and one to cover it up	9
0	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it i ordered the soundtrack from the movie but it was not the soundtrack they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack i was disappointed	9
0	yo nu mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan they take great songs and make crappy beats get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money	9
0	i did n't really feel like some of the songs were really love songs a lot of these songs i had not even heard before	9
0	while well produced i was disappointed in the album mostly because the majority of the tracks were re recordings frankie laine still sounds great but it just was n't the same i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly \( and in a couple of cases very \) different in tempo and vocal inflection it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different much slower with vocal emphasis changed i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp	9
0	if you want the original recordings do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of the beverly hillbillies and the munsters that just do n't sound right to me if the original recordings do n't matter to you then you may like this cd	9
0	i like the music but the sound quality is terrible i bought this cd because it was released in 2003 but there is zero improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks	9
0	what a shame c a was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice maybe she wanted to be this way but most likely it was a manager or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears more is not always better and in this case it is definitely worse hopefully she banked her cuz i ca n't imagine that she 'll ever recover from this debacle that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood very sad	9
0	except for the song mother mother i did n't really care for the rest of the cd i bought it for mother mother so i guess i got what i wanted i had hoped to like other songs as well but oh well	9
0	it 's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album mother mother definitly rips of stairway to heaven from stairway 's ending vocals riff \( and as we wind on down the road \) does she give zep credit on that \? now that rockstar supernova has used the song twice it has brought mother mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me good female yell and complain song but i just ca n't get past that riff rip	9
0	i bought this cd not long after it came out it did n't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it ! ! ! i like somehow our love survives and abandoned garden other than that this is a mediocre effort for michael he has used this kind of brazilian theme on sleeping gypsy already stick with your roots michael you are from california not south america try buying blue pacific instead ! ! ! i abandoned this one a long time ago	9
0	i ca n't for the life of me understand the appeal or better the necessity for the black crowes to call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they do n't possess there 's nothing here that has n't been done better with more creativity and feeling and of course originality by the stones faces et al and it 's not a valid counter argument that the stones stole from the great blues masters because of course they did but what they also did is add some value something of their own that was completely fresh what these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on	9
0	i was deeply disappointed by the so called quot return of the funk quot with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup as compared to herbie hancock 's original quot headhunters quot release the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient the grease this recent release has traded the quot grits and gravy quot created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers for over produced smooth jazz funk complete with overused n'dea davenport r amp b hooks that left this album flat	9
0	this cd was supposed to expose a new side of dar willams it has failed to do this the lyrics and songs are repetitive of previous works i would suggest buying something else	9
0	bobby bare is a great singer one of the most underrated country singers ever however most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like quot detroit city quot and quot millers cave quot	9
0	i found the vocal delivery on this cd too distracting to allow me to relax the frequent hesitations and awkward phrases prevent any sense of flow the narrator 's soft lilting voice is not by itself hard on the ears but too often it sounds like she is improvising and reaching for words	9
0	usually jerry 's scores for movies are priceless \( i e the other score for quot legend quot \) but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too quot forced quot for my taste it 's ok as a weird sort of comedy album i suppose but from the main theme i was laughing because it 's meant to be such a serious experience but is n't ! i think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd \(	9
0	this cd is pretty awful you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd one of the worst songs ever is calling it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground na na na na na na na na i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer	9
0	phaeton 's son flewon wings of wax into suncrashed and burned instea	9
0	and im happy about it ! i think i might cry if'n it shows up again fareals if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c side ! i love me some roy but bruh hurt me with this one i forgive him tho cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now um hope that came out right pimp struts off stage pounds chest with gorilla fist machismo free flowing m'out yall peace !	9
0	i did not get my order you were suppoused to send my money back i am waiting thank	9
0	i'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you this cd is not like the other putumayo cds no it is not fun hip relaxing good to dance to or stimulating it is a selection of hackneyed sinatra style slop sung by a variety of leery sounding men with fake deep voices i have this rule for music if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta it sucks consider yourself warned if you like good music try french cafe instead	9
0	this is probably the worst cd i have ever bought it had won some award and just bought it without listening to it hopping that it would be ok i listened to it and threw the cd in the trashbin waist of money or just not my kind of music	9
0	i had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50 's and 60 's jazz legends before they became household names it was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again i heard brief notes from this cd and i must agree that mr winston did attempt to capturemr guaraldi 's timeless expressions but the this production did not have the same golden flow as the original	9
0	i have all her other cds i especially love unsung heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good sure the technique is spot on but there is no soul the emotion is missing for me i like my jazz vocals with feeling i like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song u wont get that here all u will get is technique	9
0	the fact that this has had no us release was an immediate warning however as a longtime fan i figured i would check it out boy is this bad there are a few decent tracks however the truly awful crazy little thing called love this magic moment only you among many others make this unlistenable miss ross is a great singer and interpeter check out the delicacy she approached the billie holliday material she is a producer 's singer ashford and simpson chic holland dozier holland even hall oates all were able to take her talent and create in some cases true all time classics this is a mess diana your voice still sounds great stop executive producing your projects	9
0	the track selection is fine and okay but the track order is bad no flow ! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile the mixing is terrible and abrupt its basically not mixing no art there	9
0	chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions nicks latest attempts have been pathetic from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days no we 're not saying recycle the older productions but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions a signature if you will and hey it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class yes how the mighty have fallen oh brother	9
0	agreed the fan is there but i must admit they are actually singing well in the actual solesmes style \( based on these samples \) i have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant this is not as bad as it gets i assure you try to find something from a seminary or monastery	9
0	i would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb quite frankly i would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just reburning these cd 's and reselling them for 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite	9
0	i was prepared to spend the original 26 05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack at that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 cds ordered i was refunded the money to the last starfighter due to an error listing when i went to re order the new price is 49 95 what a joke ! someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin i would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition but until it is sold at a fair price i will reserve my rating	9
0	when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony one can only be disappointed in diva destruction 's music the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut	9
0	like the other reviewer of this cd i am also a fan of buffalo tom unfortunately this does n't sound very similar to bt in fact it is a bit dull none of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick after you hear it you instantly forget it i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair since i only played it 3 times hoping it would grow on me i 'd recommend up here instead of this one it 's much more listener friendly	9
0	very very dissapointed e 40 raps too quick he is too hard to understand and he sounds like a trick	9
0	stinkish i totally agree with you 100 ! ! ! ! what was mattel thinking when they released this item \? some songs are ok but hit me baby one more time \? that song is soooo old ! and so yesterday by lip singer hilary duff is sooooo yesterday ! ! ! ! you gotta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it if you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review	9
0	i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop rock this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub par some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why \? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is mold fitting white noise	9
0	ryuichi sakamoto 's credibility is on the precipice with chasm a turgid unlistenable work of crud check out coro and only love can conquer hate both sound like factory machinery at work dire dreadful and diabolical stop being the artiste ryuichi and have a go at entertaining your fans deserve better	9
0	la grange is probably at the top of most zz top fans lists and rightly so as it is superb but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording it is so awful that i do n't know how anybody can listen to it thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for rancho texicano clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here dummies also waitin' on the bus jesus just left chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here	9
0	this album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky wacky vivid personality of the first three galactic studio albums this is boring flat and generic is that stanton moore or a drum machine \? precede straight to garage a trois	9
0	i own all of bebo norman 's cds and i love all of them except for this one i bought it and listened to it once and i hated it it does not sound like bebo this sounds like steven curtis chapman or michael w smith or any of the other mass produced christian pop music artists on all of his previous albums even though he changed his sound slightly it was still generally very acoustic and bebo ish this album sounds nothing like his previous music i was disappointed	9
0	i expected more african vocals in it thats the main reason i brought the cd i recently became a fan of that kind of music it had like 3 songs on there that i liked besides that this album is garbag	9
0	on the track cleo 's mood it sounds like something that bookert and the mg 's along with the mar key horns would 've cut it sounds like steve cropper on the guitar and booker t jones on the keyboards the sax style is definately jr it 's a soothing piece	9
0	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short shorts once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	9
0	this is humor \? when does the humor begin \? is it close to the end cause i reckon that this ai n't funny maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone i reckin	9
0	this was the worst thing i 've ever heard except maybe clap your hands say yeah my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever	9
0	this album had two good songs at the most ralph was good with new edition it 's apparently obvious that he ca n't stand alone bobby should have been the lead for new edition then we may never have seen this terrible album ralph is n't that good of a singer this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does n't mean you are the best ralph is miles behind bobby	9
0	this air supply should 've been cut off a very long time ago whenever any of their songs comes on the radio i immediately shut it off bad ear candy is all they ever recorded mindless sappy garbage even bread 's music was more interesting than this	9
0	the 1 star is for this 5 star cd box set being no longer available does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon \? i have the highlights cd and the live at the plugged nickel double lp but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling thank you in advance for any help scott k fis	9
0	it 's not great music to dance to	9
0	first show on broadway i ever left at intermission i bought the tickets because i did n't think i could go wrong seeing a show directed by strohman starring craig bierko who was fantastic in music man and was flat flat flat in this show and music by harry connick jr whom i have loved forever it taught me that everything has it 's place and harry 's place is not a broadway stage i hope for his sake he does not try again if i could rate something at zero stars this would get that rating	9
0	i'm a hardcore lynch fan and find this album a big dissapointment i like his older season of da sicc style nott this new stuff in one song they 're talking about louie vitton thats not the lynch i kno	9
0	i may not be an expert on steel drums but i do listen to jimmy buffett a lot ! he has a great steel drum drummer after listening to this cd i gave it away in a white elephant gift exchange this past xmas	9
0	this cd its just horrible they sold only 10 000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! there are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out	9
0	i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70 's and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style i still loved her vocal perfection this is truly the only album i have n't played more than twice \( i did n't like it the first time which surprised me so i tried it again \) it does n't showcase her voice or her talents the songs are very ho hum linda put out a christmas album \( been waiting for years \) and try to get sweetness back for this old fan	9
0	jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you but he missed the mark with me big time	9
0	she does n't sing she yells ! ! ! and using one of ednita 's songs as she did with lo que son las cosas is just sacrilege at its best \( or worst \) it 's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself she has absolutely nothing on beyonce or cristina aguilera her cd is just plain bad ! if you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices \( and that actually sing \) you might want to look for la lupe celia cruz ednita nazario and lucecita benitez and these are only the ones i remembered at the moment	9
0	if this is n't worst dead album then in the dark is	9
0	you know the music industry is in decline when people are giving this single a perfect rating run for cover	9
0	there is not enough space for me to explain why this film \( and soundtrack \) are woefully inadequate of the name dr seuss the fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism \( what the book was complaining about wake up people ! \) and james horner 's score which has a couple of nice moments but does n't have that seussian sound 'where are you christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and i mean both versions and whose bright idea was it to have jim carrey mangle 'you 're a mean one' \? if you 're looking for a more grinch like score go find elfman 's nightmare before christmas	9
0	i 've owned this cd but did n't keep it for very long because it 's too poppy and slick for my tastes i guess when about 1981 came around billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70 's style and on this offering he kind of wanted a 50 's or 60 's kind of sound this stuff is just to slick for this hombre he never made a solid album after the release of glass houses in about 1980 this is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about but if you 've got some integrity you 'll probably want to steer clear of this one and buy anything he recorded in the 70 's	9
0	i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band so with that in mind i though i 'd try osftgh what i hear and it certainly seems i'm missing out on something is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting just because you have mead dripping from your beard and you scream out lyrics that contain no mercy vengeance and it 's your time to die does not mean you can create authentic viking metal these idiots could definitely take lessons from enslaved manegarm falkenbach to name a few do n't fall for the hype !	9
0	this cd just does n't have the quality it should some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as danny boy i have the cassette and it was great but this just does n't do justice to ray price or his songs	9
0	i knew this would n't be the sia from zero 7 's album little did i know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents zero 7 have behind the mixing boards the song production is terrible i could n't find one song i really liked on this cd sia truly has a unique voice but it 's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight still i'm severely disappointed particularly because i had to pay for this cd as an import	9
0	ignore the big word karaoke on the cover and the microphone shown this is just a music cd it does not display anything in a karaoke player	9
0	this album is not what i call a album first 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats best track on here is quot i practice looking hard quot probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career i love that song but otha than that quot captain save a hoe quot and quot mail man quot are a discrace he shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track	9
0	i got hooked on tiesto about 5 years ago heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album neverhteless it was n't but it was still tiesto though right \? well the hits on this cd are about 5 years old the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists stick with tiesto nyana 10130340345435 times better	9
0	wen i bouht dis cd i thought is waz my holmes on it but it was jus sum dude wid a big azz hoodie and hat when i put dis in my playa it was broken the rappers main peter voice sounded liek a blender dah turntables sound like my moms bong a bubblin damn nigga was my favorite track but that was n't on dis cd i wish i had da real copy and not da malufunked up one peace out dawg keep it real and stay won wid dah underdawgzz	9

0	amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms' music with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius' the choice of music is also quite perfunctory there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose buy at your own risk my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd	9
0	there is at times a fine line between noise and music nin not only crossed that line in this cd but stomped on it a few times in the process not even close to the calibre of with teeth this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians songs that go from semi music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide while playing the same thing over and over and well you get my drift if great music is your thing pass this one up or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination	9
0	an absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians i gotta say i could have used a little more cowbell	9
0	a lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves ironic lyrics like image of the invisible do not make them intellectual this trash is not music get it off my radio ! if only i could give 0 stars	9
0	i love the smoky piano bar sound of this album i picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh	9
0	i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words although the music is nice i know she would not be too impressed we had seen the movie together and we loved mr ray 's song and wanted to know the words it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it	9
0	item never came however in their defense refund was promptly given out i only wish that i had a chance to receive this one	9
0	i understand why so many people like dido she is beautiful has a decent voice comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive this album is the same 'inoffensive' some might say bland the tracks that work for me are 'thank you' \( used on eminem 's 'stan' \) but is done solo here and it works 'hunter' and 'here with me' the rest just disappear into the background like a passing car nothing much happens nothing inspires i really want to like her but it 's all been done before	9
0	this is a cd of the history of the band interesting but was not a music cd was not worth the price	9
0	this will be the third time i have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album and i suppose i have been too harsh because neither of my previous efforts have been posted lets keep this one simple this is not music plain and simple i purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site and was terribly disappointed it basically consists of massively distorted \( and detuned \) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence structure or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument call it performance art experimental noise whatever it 's simply not music	9
0	dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer unfortunately the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts songs that seem formulaic and quot safe quot his best songs are the lesser known works listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them they 'll never make it to the pop airwaves serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd quot greatest hits quot is not synonymous with quot greatest music quot	9
0	i love the song quot nasca lines quot which i first heard on a putamayo world music cd so i ordered quot under one sky quot since it has quot nasca lines quot i figured all the music would be as good but i was so disappointed it was very jazzy which i hate i'm going back to the putamayo cds	9
0	i am very dissapointed with this dualdisc because there is no comment \( worning \) about dvd region protection what can i do with this disc region 1 in europe \( region 2 \) \? my message for sony corporation is this format will not exist for long with dvd region protection ! sorry my first and last dualdisc back to the sacd	9
0	while the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded there are way too many birds around the cd describes their sound as distant and faint but that 's far from accurate the parts of the cd where all you hear is the stream alone do n't add up to more than 10 minutes and never last more than a minute for the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds rather close and sometimes very loud buyer beware the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all ! very misleading	9
0	once the very best of 10cc was released in 1997 it was the collection to have that collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc 's career ending with the godley and creme hit cry so why would this cd be released especially since the only thing it offers over the prior cd is channel swimmer and do n't hang up \? buy the cd how dare you and the very best of 10cc and you will have three times the music you have on this cd for only twice the price an unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio	9
0	\( with the possible exception of klemperer 's fidelio \) i am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message as mr clinton 's campaign team would say it 's the singing stupid do not be mislead by the starry names this thing barks and yowls like new year 's eve in the cats and dogs home do not pass go do not waste 35 go directly to josef krips on decca legends for three discs of perfect joy	9
0	i bought two copies of this sacd both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly be forewarned i dont have any other problems with other sacds so i assume it is in the production somewhere they would lock up for no reason this is right out of the box both copies	9
0	awful i mean really awful and i liked self portrait because you knew dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image this album is just a disaster the lyrics are ok on most songs \( i 've seen worse by dylan \) but the music is unexciting not very creative and downright embarrassing on some tracks why oh why did you have to make an album like this bob \? such talented people at your disposal for these sessions and you threw it away on garbage arrangements shameful really sad	9
0	this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work frankly it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators some of the craig chaquico style stuff was interesting but better left to craig try 7th heaven mosaico or guitar odyssey instead	9
0	right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i 've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks do n't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble	9
0	carter burwell 's soundtrack music to quot rob roy quot was an early sign that he was not just getting it right the score is all wrong but so is the movie this movie needed an uplifting score carter burwell could not deliver it	9
0	when will artist realize you ca n't change the old classics the only successfull r b group to sing the classic night and day to their own beat was the temptations cd what women want the best rendition i have ever heard smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs another good cd with classics is willie nelson 's stardust	9
0	this never should 've been pressed they should 've taken the mix and thrown it out do not buy ! !	9
0	i really think snoop is a good rapper he should only have stopped 10 years ago i'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff and i do n't like none of the beats here and what 's left then \? nothing i found out after i bought this album i'm not a snoop fan anymore old school is the bes	9
0	this is as bad as the film in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula will amp his movies amp music never change the same old beat the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad unoriginal amp boring what a waste of kool moe dee	9
0	what a load of junk gu 29 cd1 was ok everything else these two have done separately is pretty useless make sure you hear a sample before buying this do n't say you were n't warned	9
0	but for the drugs do n't work which is marginal at best this album is boring cookie cutter nothing original	9
0	what an outrageous group how can anyone like this rubbish maybe an horde of brainless people how i feel happy in being intelligent and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres how said romans it 's just bread and circus to the poors give to people what they deserve rubbish ! it 's because you mediocre people that buy this that this kind of people the members of this group get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be it 's the same horde that buy beyonce spears madona and other outrageous poor music	9
0	please make these songs available to listen with windowsmedia !	9
0	i am a huge fan of thomas newman but really this cd presents nothing new it comes across as merely a re hash of the airy atmospheric melody free cues from his other recent scores it has none of the originality of american beauty or road to perdition frankly as much as i like his scores i do n't think this warranted a cd release it 's just got too bland and ordinary no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds a pity	9
0	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy this cd was very boring the beats are too similar on every track and the cd as a whole just has no quot feeling quot to it if you want to hear him at his best by 97 octane	9
0	from the twang of his guitar to the cowboy hat perched on his head george strait is totally and completely revolting i mean for goodness sake the man 's like 100 years old ! how much longer is it going to take for everyone to realize that \? if you like this kind of music please go to charter before you 're beyond help take this as a warning do n't buy the cd	9
0	i like machine head a lot many people disliked the burning red and called them sell outs but i appreciated the effort to make something different then came supercharger i have listened to it a dozen times looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it it never came this is a bad cd by a great band	9
0	sinceramente no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas incluso renombrados artistas hacia este musico ungido de la leyenda grape amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados lastima piedad curiosidad no se me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson \( 13th \) en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio en fin son opiniones nada mas	9
0	great fan of the man they call 'sugar' zucchero but this outing is really below par this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs with the addition of other famous singers did he send the original recordings to these people en did they ad little pieces here and there \? it sounds like it ! none of the songs have gotten' better compared to the originals to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money \( and get more attention for 'sugar' outside of italy \? \) do n't buy it get 'oro' 'shake' or 'blue sugar' instead	9
0	this cd is without a doubt amazing stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig his tone is crushing sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song	9
0	this album bores me out of my mind only two decent tracks bad boys and bonnie and clyde and i'm no avid radio listener bet and mtv actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks so i guess they good for somethin	9
0	id advise not to buy the album listening to it is like contacting gonorrhea trust me ive done both	9
0	aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time they only made 3 decent songs in same old song and dance seasons of wither and janies got a gun rest of the songs just stink explosively avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band steven tyler screams he ca n't sing at all \? \? \? this is music for drug addicts	9
0	\( it \? \) i have many of david and japan 's albums but this thinly composed album is repetitive boring and annoying i think there were some hidden tracks too but i just wanted the album to be over you are better off with dead bees on a cake secrets of the beehive or any bee related titled album of his	9
0	as you might think i am not a die hard fan of jmj i think that when only die hard fans rates an album it makes you think that with such a high rating everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth not everybody like this king of musical experimentation some do but some do n't i like oxygene and equinoxe and even after all those years they are still good to listen too rendez vous offers some really good moments but we are far from the perfection as oxygene or equinoxe rendez vous is easier to get use to that zoolook is but we are far from a near perfect album that 's all	9
0	the cd came without a cd case and the cd did not play i am very disappointed	9
0	this cd isnt real good if you like compilations than get the ruff ryders c	9
0	listening to this c d first gave me a headache then it made my stomache churn it is so uninspired it 's not even funny \( or listenable \) yeah it 's loud but i can be loud too if i had some pots and pans and a guitar do n't get this it 's nothing but d r i v e l	9
0	if i ca n't buy the cd with all the songs that were played in the movie then i wo n't buy it i know one cd could cover the entire movie so why ca n't this be done \? does it concern copy rights and releases	9
0	this whole post crap grunge is crap if you want real rock check out gnr acdc and any band pre grunge i know this is a review but how does this grab ya oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom quot oh how did we wind up like this \? quot exactly what i'm trying to figure out tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break	9
0	the singing is terrible on fly me to the moon do n't take my word for it listen to the free sample supplied by amazon com at 16 seconds into it when she sings all i worship and adore she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it the rest of the pieces sound fine	9
0	ok let me preface my comments by justifying the 2 star rating it 's rodney dangerfield he was a class act as for the cd if you 're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone 's cheesy clavinova then this cd is for you i bought this because of the last track rappin' rodney and boy was i disappointed it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette do yourself a favor get all of rodney 's dvd 's with his standup material and remember him for what he was a comedy legend	9
0	i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called mastering i have original un mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set ! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go but in all honesty this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for i cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close save your money and wait	9
0	most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this cd is missing lot of songs which define extreme the implication that it is a quot best of quot and not a quot greatest hits quot should have included more from their self titled album tsk tsk this does n't include quot mutha \( do n't wanna go to school today \) quot how can that be	9
0	oh man this sucks really bad good thing nu metal is dead thrash metal is real metal this is for posers	9
0	there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano he would have composed for it let 's consider another possibility if some style insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these pedagogical compositions in other words the point is lost	9
0	to much guitar drowns out all the other instruments survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums not guitars i was expecting another burning heart is this love high on you no songs on this albums have that sound the vocals by jamison are top notch but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards bass and drums not drive the whole song i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel the rest are throw aways recommended for die hards only i highly recommend 'when seconds count' for anyone getting started with survivor	9
0	if you are short on money do not buy this c d you will regret it however if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good especially the dr evil quot just the two of us quot really this is not a good album as side two is rubbish i still have n't listened to it all the way throug	9
0	when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring unfortunately one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this if you want to hear them at their best buy the 1st album happy trails or lost gold and silver	9
0	yes she has a great voice but this entire cd is so overproduced so lifeless so very boring that i had to force myself to listen to the entire thing searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice she sounds as bored as i was on every song i hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep	9
0	nana has a beautiful voice but her singing is monotonous predictable she lacks passion sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song in addition to this the arrangements are unfortunately very poor her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles but this is not the album i would like to listen to again and again	9
0	as a gene autry fan particularly of his christmas recordings i was really looking forward to this release but what a disappointment ! i will look over the dropouts obviously the source tapes have deteriorated but what happened to the final three cuts \? they are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable and i know the disc is short but were the 2 second pauses between tracks really necessary \? talk about choppy no flow at all this cd did make me do one thing go back into my archives and pull out my original grand prix vinyl i think i 'll be doing a transfer and retire this cd to the bottom shelf	9
0	blues singers should n't try to go mainstream if they do try and succeed fine that means they 've stayed true to their roots when they try and fail \( as susan has done with hope and desire \) one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started for me that was just wo n't burn i guess when one is happily married with children it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them you 're faking them	9
0	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	9
0	will not run on my computer love the content however i keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my mp3 i will be demanding a refund ! do not buy if you have a mp3 supported car stereo if you plan on playing at your computer it will not work due to ill conceived piracy protection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	this is a wonderful album that evokes memories of the 60 's folk boom yet contains original songs i was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements anyone who loves the movie a mighty wind and who loves folk music will fall in love with this album i know i did	9
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album it dies today rip off the former bands style but they are still a very good band in the over crowded metalcore market of today that is a rarity my only complaint is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice \( as heard on the radiance \) but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music still 5 5 material though favorite songs the radiance freak gasoline fight our disintigration and the caitliff choir defeatism	9
1	like i said i would i finally got around to purchasing this cd i especially like tracks 9 12 cheap trick is solid as always i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases if i do have any criticism at all it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30 years anyway there are some great tunes on this buy it like i did !	9
1	ok good cd im not suprised ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings i like that daddy thing song and like a dj this album looks at issues from a mans point of view ya know we 've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well also this is a break from that that is played on the radio	9
1	great anniversary present fav song i love the way you love me my husband loves to listen to it in the car	9
1	relationships and drug use are major themes this album starts off with two absolute killer tunes lets down some but has a joy thoughout i ca n't believe this is going to be his only album what a shame from someone who has been listening to rock for a long time i tell ya this is a blast pure fun something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love mostly rather quickly paced one of my favorite albums of the 90s more people should listen	9
1	i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release but they have while faded seaside glamour is more immediately catchy and refined you see colours comes at you in a much more intense manner the songs are more mature the musicianship is top notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom end and soaring harmonies the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release the delays put it all together great songwriting strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre bending mix that has something for everybody it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states buy it	9
1	if you like vocalese then this cd is for you the song selection and performances are excellent in my opinion it stands up with the best lambert hendricks and ross stuff it is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the making of this record buy and enjoy	9
1	this is a wonderful fun and soothing cd ! it will relax children and parents will enjoy it even after the 100th listen ! ! my husband is a musician and he loves both of the dan zanes cds we have this will now be a gift i give to all my friends and family when they have a baby	9
1	this album sparked the so called neo soul movement years before it was adopted by other artists back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and prince broke the music back down to its roots this concept was later used by tone tony toni brand new heavies and d'angelo	9
1	this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded damien 's vocal range is vast his musicianship excellent but it 's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists haunting sensitive flowing crashing \( if i have one criticism it 's the mixing levels at times his vocals are drowned in concert when he lets rip you really feel the power of his vocals music which unfortunately does n't come over quite as well on the album \) a truly magical album	9
1	a friend loaned me her cd and i absolutely loved it but i could not purchase it anywhere my daughter suggested i contact you results results ! ! ! ! thank you ! a most outstanding seasonal soft listening cd	9
1	this cd is really really good warped tour never fails to please the best songs are by these people the used yellowcard story of the year matchbook romance the early november avoid one thing taking back sunday audio karate simple plan maxeen coheed and cambria and mest buy this c	9
1	wonderful instrumentals and lyrics a shenandoah lullaby is simply beautiful i love the way the ending segues into brahm 's lullaby his version of arkansas traveller is refreshing teddy bears' picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard there ai n't no bugs on me is my two year old daughter 's favorite judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time i like all the songs on the cd a breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop	9
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd have some of the songs as performed by other artists but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer i'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity	9
1	rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity its not real hip hop this album brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop honestly the light is a song that never gets old thats real if you do n't have this album get it	9
1	this cd is a confusing mix of punk bands from pop punk 's sum 41 amp good charlotte to punk favorites alkaline trio vandetta red amp the casualties to bands that i 've never even heard of such as unsung zeros ozma amp destruction made simple i reccomend this cd if you 're looking for new bands to like amp listen to although it 's a confusing cd it gives you new ideas of just how deep you 're going to go in the punk underground	9
1	nice cd cool beats songs like welcome to atlanta pick it u	9
1	for a true christian spirit that glows through ms winans you 'll always find her music sung straight from the heart a precious pearl in the gospel community purified continues in the cece tradition of lifting our souls to a higher plain	9
1	i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention shoegazers \? \? \? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger just buy it and all the rest	9
1	wow ! what a great collection of great classic songs ! we highly recommend this to anyone with any age kids who want to have fun and have fun without the tv ! hokey pokey baby that 's what it 's all about	9
1	these guys and this album rocks just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head does n't 'demote' it to pop props to the great use of two bass guitars released amid the misery grunge rock explosion of the early 90 's this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again this album is highly recommended kill your television grey cell green cut up throwing things happy and until you find out are just an awesome experience if you can find the grey cell green single release i highly recommend that for the track entitled 'trust '	9
1	it 's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album this is a timeless work it never gets old no matter how many times it is played i 've had this album for 5 6 years and i pull it out every summer great music for boating or bbq 's on the deck i promise you will love it something everyone should have in their collection	9
1	i 've gotten a copy of this cd for every friend i have so they can know what i'm talking about when i crack a random joke my mom even loves it and she would not be considered the 'target market' for mitch check out his first cd if you can find it in stores if not go online	9
1	there are some amazing moments on this record i find myself freaking out to three songs in a row and waiting for the fourth song to end the de la collaboration is weak it 's got the great wild style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious some of the more r b toned tracks fall flat in my opinion	9
1	this is one of my favorite releases from common this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers songs like i used to love h e r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio	9
1	growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart i did n't think i 'd like this cd one evening i was having dinner at a friend 's home and they had this one playing it was beautiful being a little older now \( in my early 40 's \) i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now this cd of rod 's was nostalgic romantic and extremely easy to listen to	9
1	joan you do n't love me because i'm a guy but i have loved you since 1976 ok so i'm an old man \( age 43 \) so what she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett this album like most of her other albums consists of a mix of old and new songs does n't mattar i love it and the video well it confirms what we have always known not that it matters the music matters	9
1	nothing at all like boy band cds \( insync backstreet boys etc like editorial compared it to \) while some of the songs are over processed and do n't allow clay 's strong clear and beautiful voice to shine through enough it is overall a very good cd it has some catchy tunes on it his second cd merry christmas with love allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more	9
1	this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock ! it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time	9
1	this album is absolutely beautiful the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album but this one makes the cut each song wraps you in a warm trance a coccoon of well being it has a really positive emotional effect on me it creates an ambiance of gentle strength wonderful i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums	9
1	i was at the brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they ca n't be better standout tracks include the two by martha wainwright the two by teddy thompson perla batalla 's bird on a wire rufus' chelsea hotel and \( from the sydney concert \) antony 's if it be your will two major disappointments though the inclusion of u2 as backing band for leonard cohen 's own version of tower of song seems done for purely commercial reasons and does n't work and the nonsensical ommission of linda thompson 's sublime take on alexandra leaving here 's hoping it 's included on the dvd release	9
1	this is not only brian eno 's best album but one of the finest albums ever made a work of simple beauty complex intelligence and imagination	9
1	call it american folk call it alt country call it what you like but if you heard this aussie trio on cbs or npr earlier this week suffice to say their in a category all their own love that harmonica up all night by the waifs is appropriately titled i 'll be up all night listening to it	9
1	it 's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there but thank halstead co for proving me wrong i am happily pleased with their latest and very eagerly awaited effort instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on say out of tune they give us 41 minutes of what seems like basically it 's good everything 's going just way ok it 's happy maybe i 'll hear a lyric later that says something else but for those for whom music is the priority you ca n't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop four and a half stars	9
1	you definetely gotta own this after an 11 years break from the music scene seger 's back full force already 400 000 copies sold more info on bob at	9
1	jon brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie if you liked this movie by all means buy the soundtrack you will not be dissapointed eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie it makes me feel just good also be sure to pick up his solo record meaningless if you liked the movie buy this cd you wont regret it	9
1	umm i do n't think you quite got the point of this album it is not about the artists that you like it is about the artists that inspired moore your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh i find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying f ck you soad and so on have some respect for other 's opinions unfortunately you are a steriotypical ignorant american so with all that said and with all due respect i say f ck you pal	9
1	i'm a huge matchbox fan and i listen to a collection of all 3 albums all day long i never get tired of it ! rob thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me his lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me what a great band ! what a great album ! what a great musical ride !	9
1	okay bryce nickelback yells not screams big difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not scream at all and you say i like music well you dont know any thing about music and another thing you poser is that limp bizkit is not metal they rap so how can you say that they scream all the time limp bizkit is the worst band out their they give a bad name to music itself and as for you dont write anymore reviews until you know more about music wich with the information i just got from you that will take a long tim	9
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade thus putting me in constant cravings for new material though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch truly vast and intimate at the same time and a voice that speaks to something very deep sad and lovely inside you	9
1	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original metal box of ep 's when it first came out years later the second edition came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out eventually the second edition came out on this cd so i finally could own a digital copy myself pristine audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion if i remember correctly you do need to listen to this you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too	9
1	michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana this record is her first with friend jessica harp the ladies mine the borderline between the singer songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format highlights include the opening track leave the pieces way back home the good kind and the title track stand still look pretty of special note is the presence of producer multi instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks i recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't sound like formula country	9
1	what a great album this is not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to but the lyrics are a hoot ! wayne is not afraid to experiment he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way the songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you have n't heard in a long time this album instantly became one of my favorites i bought two more to give as gifts	9
1	as with her second album i love thankful kelly clarkson has a beautiful voice and has a lot of talent i especially like whats up lonely you thought wrong and just missed the train although the whole album is very good	9
1	just wonderful wonderful ! even if you have n't seen the movie buy the music so lovely and refreshing of course there is no one like van morrison \( always and forever a 5 star \) he tops the all time charts for me kevin kline is so smooth with la mer and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting you just ca n't miss with this one	9
1	the album is straight raw kurupt 's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with daz 's delivery the g funk beats are the best they 've ever sounded as a whole you will not skip one song at all a	9
1	cool cd have n't heard it in probably 15 to 20 years it was fun to hear it again funny though it 's a bit different than the way i remember it	9

1	this is my favorite ghostface slbum it has a geat vibe to the cd and you could not get sick of hearing it check it out and you wont be dissapointed rating a	9
1	i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating it 's like the first beatles anthology set the material is amazing but the quality is bad on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise the packaging is also very nice i just though i 'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set if you are a stooges fan do n't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait	9
1	i got what i wanted in the time frame promised the way it 's supposed to work	9

1	well here we are one of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90 's lifeforms is true sonic adventure this is obviously some of the best work that fsol ever did lifeforms is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together interchanged and meshed for ambient work it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace there is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs despite their being ambient it is very original i praise originality in music give it a try put on some flower bird wings or some elaborate burn	9
1	i love jazzy hip hop of the early '90s and if you do too this is the album you must listen to ! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous \( and the most beautiful of the entire cd ! \) award tour steve birko \( stir it up \) and midnight enjoy this pearl of real hip hop ! ! !	9
1	wandering through the dorms in the 1970 's this was one of those albums that was in everyone 's collection it was usually very near the front of the record stack every time i hear that opening guitar riff from reelin' in the years i glide back to a very nice place in time if you hope to understand the evolution of us pop rock music you need to become intimate with this recording !	9
1	this is some great music from a litte know movie you wo n't be let down	9

1	brian regan is simply a comedic genius this cd is especially funny after having seen him live you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions ! he has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we 've all said done thought while i too enjoy comedians who are more cutting edge i do n't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny this cd is well worth any price check out his dvd and his live show too	9
1	you can resume eddie cochran very well with one cd after all when he died he was only 21 years old this selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the legendary master series released in 1990 his best songs are there summertime blues was of course a favorite of the who who often featured it in their concerts i am particularly fond of jeannie jeannie jeannie c'mon everybody and the marvellous somethin'else with it 's great shuffle a trademark of eddie if you are interested in rock 's early days you 'll enjoy this cd	9

1	at the end of the day when you come home from school or work one ca n't say quot i feel great quot rather than great we are stressed and tired the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly i too am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain and it does work it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping with quiet natural sounds it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you	9
1	i have been a barry manilow fan since i was a teenager i have never been disappointed with any of his work and this cd is no exception ! he is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous ! his voice is as good as ever ! even my 7 year old begs to listen to the cd everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words !	9
1	i am a lover of greatest hits compact discs but this one by far is the best one i have purchased recently this compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that joe walsh made and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock !	9

1	i am just writing this review to correct alexander from russia who cites this album as a christianity peddler leonard cohen is a jew who unlike bob dylan \( on john wesley harding \) embraces his sense of jewish heritage and religion within his music alexander you 've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly jewish artist and his work	9

1	what a beautiful album ! one of the rare albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts i 'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh	9
1	i had been hearing always thinking of you but i never got who it was i purchased xm radio and on the smooth jazz channel i heard the cut again and got the artist name purchased the cd based on that one cut every cut is great on this cd i look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future he has his own style but not only do you hear hints of benson and brown i hear a little doc powell as well i will be introducing friends to this great artist keep it coming	9
1	hey bret is one of the most tallented song writers of our time ! he will be in the rock n' roll hall of fame when he is done and his guitar playin' and singin' is very underrated ! buy this	9
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo was cast very well its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 and the sisters even though they were n't the leads they all had such great songs especially beth whose song some things are meant to be always brings tears to my eyes its just so touching i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr	9
1	i saw these guys live in the twin cities last week they opened for keane and the zutons these guys were definitely the best part of the show they had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun to top it off they sounded great and their songs were well written give these guys a shot unless you hate rock 'n' roll ! !	9

1	i just refreshed my ears listening to riot again ! getting to to hear 1 2 full which clocking in at just over 4 minutes is sheer electric blues magic the price of this album is worth this one rocker alone it was nice to see it on easy street \( along with lukin' excellent ! \) any way this number totally kicks ! definitely get this if you do n't already own it	9
1	this is my favorite jazz album of all time put simply this was miles davis at his best the notes on this album simply float and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense do n't let the thirty second clips fool you i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading i took a chance on it and it was the best gamble i 've ever made a must have for any jazz enthusiast	9
1	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt lots of cool instrumentation pete anderson did a great job with the production this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago	9
1	for those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here the title sums up the overall feeling of the songs there 's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it does n't lift your mood caution must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer	9
1	i like every song but 1 on this cd they 're the same ones that 're on the movie and if you do n't like the movie you probably would n't like the cd	9
1	john michael mongomery is back with a big bang this album is one of the best to come out this year it 's better than that of travis tritt alan jackson and kenny chesney the song i wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since alan 's where were you he mixes the soulful ballads with his country rockers and sweet love songs this is vinatage jmm and should be bought by any true country music fan	9

1	this cd has tons of power and soothing energy it really shows off how well part understands the human voice	9
1	i have been a brickman fan since the very first album much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much electronic enhancement escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano if you are a brickman fan this is a must have album	9
1	this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10 years they 've been together it 's easily worthy of 10 stars this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow and to get more intimate with the band i hav n't purchased this album yet because i already have all their albums but plan on it the new tracks are from the answer that and very proud of ya era they 've finally been released on cd this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also anyway buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try	9
1	this guy is a freak of nature ! different but in the same vein as illinoise i loved it no fillers to speak of if you liked some of the more laid back songs on illinoise ! you 'll love this album its great regardless highlights are avalancheadlai stevensonsaul bellowthe mistress witch from mcclurespringfiel or bobby got a shadfly caught in his hairno man 's landthe perpetual self or what would saul alinsky do \? s	9
1	i bought this recording along with blood on the tracks recently and all i can say is doggonit it do n't get any better than this they called elvis the king but bob dylan must be the wizard who will tell us great stories when he is gone \?	9
1	anyone who had access to a radio in the 80 's would know at least two songs by missing persons their fun music and amazing flare \( dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great ! \) make this a good party album i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great just as an added note warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran \( my personal favorite band \) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986 ! !	9
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time oh my god i am breathless i was brought to tears as they sang mama my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could thank you for touching my heart i really recommend that you give this cd a chance all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score obviously need a hearing aid and a heart blessing	9
1	very different very cool ! an awesome cd that all ages in my house \( from 13 to 68 \) really enjoy listening to	9
1	this is a fantastic album the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release \( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything \) should speak volumes i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it i am a pretty constant consumer of new music get this cd you wo n't regret it ! \( ps i 've never done an amazon review before but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me \) it is melodic catchy uplifting and cheeky in short a little piece of musical bliss	9
1	neil young 's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs they are very political so unless you are a completest who likes neil young if you agree with president bush this album will be a turn off for the politically neutral or those who agree with neil young this is a good album maybe this is not neil young 's best but it still is a good album	9
1	being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals i must say i rate this as quot one of the best quot the dancers are fantastic ! the music utterly great the choice of dances \( from classical to rock \) is highly deversified can't wait till i get it so i can play it again and again as well as quot rock the house shake my bootie etc quot	9

1	i 'll have to accept that even tough i'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album it 's very melodic and more mature also the acoustic version of the diary of jane is amazing i personally recommend the songs breath evil angel and my favorite dance with the devil	9
1	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago i listened to a few minutes of it and was like what is this crap \? and i shelved it for a couple months i then picked it back up and gave it another listen to my surprise it was really catchy to me the music \( and lyrics \) are simple but thats what i like about them theyre simple ! this is a great college rock cd i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub and i suggest you do the same notable tracks are sidewinder what you do to me and is this music \?	9
1	i recently purchased this cd again i once owned it on cassette keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music andsound has sustained very well since it was released in the early90 's if you are building an old school collection with greatsingers this is a good one to have it 's great for romance orwith that special lady jaye pricebeltsville md	9
1	this is my favorite bob dylan album the album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever like a rolling stone and my favorite desolation row sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs the album is filled with incredible lyrics wonderful music and a mean harmonica if you want to know why bob dylan is a legend buy this album	9
1	all i have to say is great album	9
1	a quality album from richard long time fans will not be disappointed it will win over quite a few new fans as well with it great guitars and snappy lyrics	9
1	i purchased this cd during the lowest time of my life emotionally every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief especially the title track deep peace i would listen to it over and over bathing in the lush healing sounds each element from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs is seemingly structured at a spiritual level this is more than ambient music it 's true music therapy	9
1	what is the song that is being played when they are handoing out the dance benefit leaflets \? email me at tarahillyard aol co	9
1	the edward scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores i truly believe this is danny elfman 's best score and believe me he 's done some great scores ! the music is so moving the childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet beautiful film even people who have n't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials a must have for any danny elfman and or tim burton fan	9
1	jodeci 's forever my lady has a problem that most nineties r b releases had at that time if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa jodeci 's first cd had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one cd in 1991 stay forever my lady come talk to me u i and i'm still waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash	9
1	this book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom and the natural things all animals do it teaches them to be comfortable with without shame the move from being a diaper clad baby to a big kid the drawings are charming ! i bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction	9
1	this is an amazing beautiful album probably a little more difficult to get into than streethawk but after about the 4th or 5th listen i found it more rewarding the music is very dense and the lyrics are beautifully poetic \( it helps that dan bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time \) a great album for any fan of intelligent independent music	9
1	if you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a country song from nashville these days and you happen to like classic rock you would probably appreciate what shooter 's trying to do here folks this is the real deal i do n't mean real country or real rock this is a hybrid i mean he 's making music that is honest and down to earth a flash in the pan he 's not he 's going to be around for awhile	9
1	tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo alternative style of rock the first released single the adventure is quite enjoyable and even though i have n't checked too deeply into it i think it 's the theme song for nbc 's studio 60 besides how can you go wrong with an album that 's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada	9
1	after watching the movie walk the line i wanted to hear more of johnny cash all these years \( 35 of them \) i always thought he was just a slow folk singer his music is non stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff he toured with elvis presely and jerry lee lewis he inspired musicians like bob dylan i am so glad i bought this cd it 's the best purchase i made all year	9
1	i like the main voice \( s \) and i like the music but the voices are over powered by the music if they turned up the voices a bit i think this would be a great album this album does not sound like other albums i have so i'm not sure what to compare it to	9
1	the title gets it right this is a very fun album there are a lot of great songs on here infectious lyrics and music it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is one other thing it 's a sin that we 're the same was n't a bigger hit than it was truly a great song	9
1	this cd is truly a classic and one of my all time favorites love it	9
1	this cd is perfect for driving the downtempo beat driven ambient feel and overall togetherness of this cd is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening overall very pleased with mr schnauss' contribution to the genre highly reccomende	9
1	rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired melodies are beautifully simple and soothing sounds are particularly well crafted a great album the drum box could be a bit more discreet though	9
1	every listen i get more into this cd many catchy songs i now need to buy more of donald 's solo stuff great music	9
1	i just saw this woman live and she 's amazing ! ! ! ! the songs come alive when you hear them ! it 's hard to put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in but trust me it 's a good place ! please check her music out if you 're into heartfelt music	9
1	what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd have n't already said arthur is outrageously talented it 's almost shocking the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense it 's extremely well recorded and mixed music anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now stumble and pain is probably my favourite track the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense layered and its something he 's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album ! anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption 's son straight after that what a musician	9
1	pete rock and c l smooth came out of no where with this classic in 92 i was expecting the t roy tribute to be the only highlight but this joint was bangin ! the very underrated cl had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics chocolate boy wonder had the legendary horns going on the whole album is a banger fav 's are pete 's sake the basement \( pete 's cuz heavy d rips it \) mecca and the soul brother troy they reminisce straighten it out \( a kick in the balls for bootleggers \) ghetto 's of the mind and skinz \( cl 's cuz grand puba steals the show on this one \) eternally classic rock on	9
1	i 've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite it 's a cd that i can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy this would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island it never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good schon is unbelievable if you like this you 'll like eric johnson 's venus isle album too two of my all time favorites	9
1	it does n't get any better than this this album is a must have for all true judas priest fans this is priest when they were really getting good the guitars and the vocals rock you to the core	9
1	this is a wonderful effort by the del castillo brothers and their band mark and rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that i have ever heard i hate that anyone would compare them to the gypsy kings or strunz and farrah because i believe they \( del castillo \) are far superior even though i am a huge fan of santana i think brothers of the castle and vida are more entertaining and satisfying than santana 's last cd if you are a fan of this genre you should possess both del castillo cd 's brothers of the castle and vida their live show is among the best that i have ever seen	9
1	even if you do n't know much about donny hathaway this collection of songs is a fun mix and it 's very moving it includes some classics with roberta flack that are terrific i enjoy it tremendously	9
1	at first i thought the only reason why i wanted this cd was because idina menzel was on it but now after listening to the whole cd i was right idina menzel was amazing and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too i would highly recommend this because it is a very interesting story it 's incredibly complex music \( theoretically \) but at the same time it is very enjoyable ! ! ! ! i would give it more stars if i could but i am only allowed 5 \(	9
1	this is the stuff that rap dreams are made of ! just like the movie itself this cd is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy ! the talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so get in sit down buckle up and shut the f k up because it 's about to get rowdy up in here !	9
1	it realy has been a long wait after jellyfish this roger joseph manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way if you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel and do n't wait for the us release it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the japanese has i sure would n't want to miss any of these tracks very higly recommended !	9
1	buy it now stop reading are you still reading \? \? \? \? okay so i 'll tell you my reason why reason \( s \) why 5 1 sound dts different \( some versions better to my ears psyche \) than the cd flavor beautiful production did i mention dts you gotta hear this in dts and she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her \( gratuitously inciting flaming \) i am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have dvd 's covering her 'girl in the other room' and her 'from this moment on'	9
1	i love this album the best of phil collins i believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut i know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times suffering with his ex wife he did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well he is a great composer too bad most of his new songs 2006 times are different and so is his life i do not enjoy them as much once an artist becomes more self actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory	9
1	evan dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop punk songs this album rocks like lovey and is almost as catchy as come on feel i 've been listening to this album for weeks on end	9
1	i wore out my tape of cypress afoot is great but cypress is amazing i bought this while stationed in the army there were n't too many new wave tapes available at the px and i was n't going to listen to def leppard or bon jovi so i bought cypress one of those rare tapes that i bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months \( the jam 's snap and setting sons and the smith 's hatful of hollow are 3 other tapes i never tired of \) get this cd get it now ! it is great thanks for reissuing it	9
1	i purchased this cd with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music what i found however was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest the ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded each player displays exceptional technique both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing most impressive is listening to istomen who playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings a feat very difficult to do as a pianist this is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over	9
1	my son loves music and really likes dan zanes we started with the videos on disney and the catch that train song really got us singing so we ordered this cd now my son sings along with it dances and jumps around dan zanes really is fun for the family	9
1	i was looking for some music i could play in the car or around the house with my 19 month old son and came across this one the exact same album that i had when i was his age ! i'm so glad they redid it ! one of my fondest memories	9
1	gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james ernest tubb and dottie west i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should every song is great but the one which i really like is quot the old man and his horn quot this was a song i had never heard it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard	9
1	this is a great cd with many good songs as it is one of my favorites and bruce rules	9
1	low tech and brilliant music that seems to have channeled zappa winchester cathedral and god knows what else incredibly funny and then suddenly sad mr pink is a genius you betcha and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi city in the shadow of the industry in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people 's dreams	9
1	trace adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more ! can trace ever produce any music that sounds bad \? his low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his god ! i strongly recommend that everyone has trace 's latest cd in their collection ! a big ten four in my cd player	9
1	what else can be said about this great cd \? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs child of vision is the best \( the piano solo is killer \) of the best but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end \( no skipping over songs you do n't like \) a true classic	9
1	really nothing on this is bad the best imho is rubyhorse the brian jonestown massacre and the subways but a case could be made for any of the songs the only problem is now i have 8 other cds i need to buy	9
1	after trouble and his austin city limits appearance i thought he was just another very good singer songwriter this follow up has made me reconsider because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist he waited and it was worth the wait this reminded me immediately of john lennon \( please do n't punish me for blasphemy \) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way i did n't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording enjoy	9
1	the title gets it right this is a very fun album there are a lot of great songs on here infectious lyrics and music it still surprises me that matthew sweet is n't more popular than he is one other thing it 's a sin that we 're the same was n't a bigger hit than it was truly a great song	9
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible robben can rock and play slow blues every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford do n't miss chris cain this man is also a guitar genius	9
1	this is the album that all kenny g fans have been waiting for ! ! ! it was well worth the wait too not only is kenny g at the top of his game but the vocalists are great ! the entire group of artists is so eclectic thank you kenny g ! !	9
1	the one song i know is a remake is goodnight my love i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake but the others with which i'm familiar but do n't have original vinyl to compare only memories seem authentic the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re recordings of old vinyl or cassettes	9
1	i ca n't say with the wordsmust listen !	9
1	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album i sure do	9
1	this was one of my first albums i got i got it because of 'paradise city' but got adapted quickly to 'welcome to the jungle' and rest there were only few more metal rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens maiden 's 'powerslave' megadeth 'rust in peace' and suicidal tendencies 'lights camera revolution'	9
1	without getting too much into it this album is pretty good 4 stars for some bad ass tracks my favs are tears from the moon beautiful things as the rush comes all in all worth the money	9
1	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
1	yes there may be some small issues with the sound quality but you get used to it and wilhelm kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th century so it is worth it these are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes highly recommended	9
1	kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth the dreaming was underrated when it was first released but i think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time this is a superb album tracks like sat in your lap suspended in gaffa leave it open night of the swallow houdini and get out of my house proving this point there 's lots of anger on this album as kate put it herself many years ago and it is her darkest effort to date but it 's pure brilliance ! buy it and be convinced	9
1	so many times older recordings are not very high quality but not with this group of songs if you are a marty robbins fan \( and i am \) this cd is a must	9
1	all i can say is you must try this !	9
1	i am a big ambrosia fan and i love biggest part of me you 're the only woman how much i feel and the newer track i just ca n't let go however i wish this cd contained all of their billboard hot 100 hits the cd is missing their cover of magical mystery tour \( 39 \) and how can you love me \( 86 \) for the casual listener this cd is perfect for the chart hit completionists out there it misses a couple songs i bought this cd used for 1 99 which was a huge bargain for the songs included for that price i can certainly try to download the missing tracks	9
1	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks samples and guitars cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant	9
1	i'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews this cd is amazing it 's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave but it 's amazing none the less every song on here is beautifully written and as always cornell 's voice does n't disappoint it 's different but one of my new favorite cds	9
1	when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights but by the music she sang and how she deeply richly portrayed those songs she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her music she truly is addicting once you hear these songs these songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey	9
1	if you are expecting safari moon pt 2 you will be dissapointed air took a more adventuourous darker ambient serious experimental and ultimtately brilliant journey into electronic music the songs here range from sounding like aphex twin \( without the weird off putting effects or heavy drums \) to thievery corp air still has a beautiful sense of melody and as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put together \( even a throwaway air song is a well crafted one \) overall all us true hardcore air fans love this album those who only loved ms may not like it but that 's their loss i say	9
1	if you do not yet own dark side of the moon wish you were here and the wall do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason amlor is junk by comparison that said very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three and amlor certainly has its bright spots learning to fly and on the turning away are as good as anything pink floyd has ever produced some of the other songs are adequate but this album does not contain the front to back brillance of the earlier floyd releases it 's definitely worth having but make sure that you have the others first	9
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop the format of the album the presence of rakim his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south	9
1	considering how much bad music is out there these days this was nice to come across covers a wide range of topics and moods musicianship is pretty good i 'd recommend it to just about anyone my tastes are usually heavier and more progressive rush dream theater iron maiden queensryche but i like this disc too	9
1	good singing and good production must i say anything else \? no get this if you love mixtures of good uptempo and slow rn	9
1	this is mood making sexy great music neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies this album is great for background music \( we play it in our store \) party music or just for listing one of the best guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument buy it now	9
1	i personally like this compilation of prince it 's got most of the songs i like and the sound is great sure there could have been a few more songs included like pop life hot thing but when compared to the other compilations this disc has more of the songs that are a must have for me such as i wanna be your lover which i do n't think was included on any of the other compilations so it 's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want so that 's why i chose this disc and i'm glad i did !	9
1	i owned the album as a kid i enjoy it as much now as i did then	9
1	overdrive watching the rain enchanted teaching myself to dream glow lemon because i can are really excellent songs this album is really worth it	9
1	this is where afi began their sound change from their first 2 cd 's \( answer that stay fashionable very proud of ya \) it is much more serious than the first 2 alot angrier heavier darker and more screaming yelling as well some people say this is their best i disagree i prefer their punkier 1st 2 but i still enjoy this alot it 's all down to personal taste it gets a 5 5 for me	9
1	i have just about all of robben 's albums and i believe that this is his best work the interpretations and musicianship are outstanding robben 's improvisational playing actually comes across more like composition his technique is extremely melodic he is in my opinion one the best blues guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a very refreshing quot twist quot check out his prowess on quot you cut me to the bone quot quot prison of love quot or quot my love will never die quot	9
1	although i like this album there 's nothing that especially stands out about it it 's typical bright eyes and if you already love the band you wo n't be disappointed however it 's not one of their best albums it 's not as good as lifted not as addicting as fevers and mirrors and not as raw and endearing as letting off the happiness but yet again conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a dashboard confessional sort of way	9
1	i first encountered bird3 opening for veruca salt the summer of 2001 that band had put their faith into bird and so have i we fell in love with them all together this band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul baring lyrics to create something unique beautiful and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today you 'll find yourself not only humming along but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments you will not once regret buying this piece of art	9
1	this album is great but i'm looking for a song that i think they sung it goes pressing on we 're pressing on \( repeat \) waiting on jesus to answer our call we 're holding on \( repeat \) pressing pressing pressing if anyone knows the name of the song or has any suggestions on who sings this song please email me at udeebear1984 yahoo com thank you and have a blessed day !	9
1	hot hot heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest their first release was decent but elevator is even better great tunes drums and guitars and of course steve bays' yelping vocals there 's only three songs i really do n't care for pickin' it up soldier in a box and shame on you looking forward to the next cd	9
1	i used to be a bigger fan of joe satriani than steve vai about 10 years ago now i quickly get bored of new satriani albums but vai 's music just moves me lotus feet for example wow words cannot describe what that song does to me thanks steve	9
1	if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy it is the best debut album since definatly mayby tracks like quot golden touch quot quot v i c e quot well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging quot stumbble and fall quot which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds if you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have	9
1	one of his best times all the songs on this cd are great he express his fellings very openly with this cd people can really see who marc anthony really is	9
1	every thing he sings is perfect i 've yet to find one song that does n't move me this cd has some beauties quot daughter of mine quot is priceless quot steal away quot is very nice quot one small star quot brings tears this arrangement of quot voyage quot is probably the best i 've heard his traditional songs \( quot when you and i were young maggie quot and quot mary of argyle quot \) are beautiful i ca n't find anything on this cd i could n't listen to for hours i truly love music and listen to it constantly i find myself reaching for the mcdermott cd 's almost exclusively i have them all more please	9
1	kudos to harvey fierstein for being so true to the jean poiret play jerry herman did a wonderful score my favorite song was the best of times gene barry turns out to be a good singer esp paired with the talented george hearn	9

1	this is one of my all time favorite cds i loved all the songs on this cd except one my favorite is black girl pain and it should be an anthem and inspriration for black women all over the globe i had the pleasure of seeing talib in concert a few months ago in atlanta and his live show was even better than his cd true hip hop lives	9
1	in the early 60 's etta james was to r amp b what patsy cline was to country she could cross over and yet remain true to her roots and that 's only one part of a nearly 50 year career ! from the velvety cross over soul of quot at last quot to the hard driving memphis soul of quot tell mama quot this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today she ranks right up with aretha franklin as an influential vocalist i took far too many years to discover her power if you have n't given her a serious look yet stop wasting time and begin here	9
1	please do yourself a favor and buy this cd ! whatever you do dont listen to it in your car though no kidding aside i almost ran my car off the road because i was laughing so hard	9
1	i love that garage days re re visited is on the flip side in the cassette i had warped a long time ago ! i like this one	9
1	this was one of those rare performances where dylan 's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great the sound is rough the intonation is off the recording is filled with horrible buzzes whistles and clicks none of which matters once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk you 'll prefer them to the original album cuts i know i do absolutely essential to any collection of dylan 's work hard rain is not to be missed	9
1	for real you gotta give this man props i repect him and his music but it 's not my style he still managed to make this a good album so it 's all good much repect	9

1	i just loved this album the songs really related to my life it was nice to see that there was personal experience involved while writing the songs	9
1	ca n't say enough about how great this record is it still stands the test of time by remaining relevant summerland and mission man are my personal favs but the whole album deserves raves	9
1	this album was so good to hear when it came out i like every song on here but my favorites are still dre the watcher xxplosive what 's the difference and forget about dre those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like recommend this album highly to rap fans buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic	9
1	not speaking or understanding tibetian did n't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why it guides you like a sherpa gently leading you along the high trails powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air you are at once engulfed in the tibetian life you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants singing bowls and drums	9

1	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent	9
1	the sounds were very convincing i actually felt like i was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since i have a subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity \( all this was at night \) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect it does relax you and allows you to destress there are other types of stress management cd 's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you johnny lina	9
1	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended being that i never heard all of her albums so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin' however for me who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me some of the tracks i love a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like my favorite ones are in order eroticaray of lightbeautiful strangerthe power of goodbyedeeper and deeperthe prodution is excellent and i love the vocals if your new to madonna my opinion would be to start here but a true fan can give me lessons	9
1	first of all bob dylan is certainly not for everyone however if his style is up your alley this is a classic you can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like lay lady lay or like a rolling stone to name a couple planet waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully this is probably my favorite dylan album and i have all the classics like blonde on blonde blood on the tracks highway 61 revisited ect i 'd recommend this to any dylan fan	9
1	so incubus rocks no matter who you are or which of their albums is your favorite plainly put this album was not my favorite of theirs it 's good it 's really good but if you 're expecting incubus good you 'll be slightly disappointed	9
1	even though gary allen is a country singer he rocks as an artist ! he has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice this man 's voice is so smooth he could melt butter along with any woman 's heart guys will like him too but he 's a crooner his ballads touch women \( sigh ! \) and make men want to emulate him i enjoyed every song on this cd but my personal favorites are tough little boys and songs about rain both beg to be sang along with	9

1	i have seen phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording it is a different approach to the classic leroux novel one that is gentler and more romantic but still intense and passionate the lyrics and music are excellent even if you are an alw pto fan do n't miss this production if it plays nearby	9
1	wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories ! a must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes neil diamond 's top hits	9
1	i bought this out of a cut rack for 3 99 it sat in my cd tower for at least 5 years before i ever really listened to it i could n't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and i came close to trading it i brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album i really like the whole experience i'm lucky i brought it up here it was going nowhere at home but i'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones i do n't know anything about this band i bought it on a whim but i 'd reccommend this album and i may follow up on this band	9
1	i am very satisfied with the 1999 cd by prince it was in top condition when it arrived i would purchase again from the seller thank	9
1	loreena has a pure talent for weaving melody music and words together her song the highwayman is absolutely astounding to be able to put the old poem into music melody and verse is quite amazing	9
1	at first i did n't think there was enough new material on this soundtrack to make it worthwhile but the four previously unreleased songs are so completley wonderful especially quot all i want to know quot and quot heather quot this is an essential for any stephin merritt fan	9
1	del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently the beats of songs merge together as tracks change el p makes a cameo casual makes a cameo prince paul produces a track get this album	9

1	nwa was an original rap group and with that being said this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers along with public enemy nwa christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats although i do n't agree with some of their lyrics one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life anyways buy this album i recommend it keep it away from the kiddies though	9
1	of course no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could his trumpet can only be described as hot and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air this man 's music has life in it unfortunately the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series ken burns' collection here is more versatile but just not as lively as dizzy 's music can be proceed with caution	9
1	i really think it 's simon 's best this and perhaps \( in a very different style \) paul simon i'm just listening to it again after several years the melodies are intricate the words are vivid and allusive the range is astounding graceland has a wonderful rock style going on but i really think this is my favorite i know a lot of non simon fans who love this one album it 's just fantastic	9

1	comparing gogol bordello and juf is like comparing apples and oranges i have seen gogol live more times than i have fingers and toes to count on when i bought juf i did not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a gogol album this is a dancehall album you like it or you do n't but just remember it is a side project it does not make any sense to compare it to other gogol albums listen before you buy	9
1	this cd brings back memories of the early 60 's when vince martin and fred neil played at the flick the coffee house and the hootenanny here in miami i 've had the lp forever now that i'm getting the cd i can listen in my car and remember seeing them perform live	9

1	i love this album mc lyte is one of the best female rappers how can someone not like her rap	9
1	this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film cater burwells score is a pitch perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly also an added bonus of the above mentioned dream combination bartok 's quot allegro quot \( i know diddly about classical music but bartok rocks ! ! \) and a typically great bjork song quot amphibian quot \( in two versions \) that book ends the album with an etherial dream like haze	9
1	i loved this album strangely enough i was introduced to the title song by gray 's anatomy where i just had to find out who was singing that lead \( alice russell \) the rest of the album is like the r b music i grew up with definitely worth a listen	9
1	there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology the remaster is splendid another good reason is the great bonus tracks almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store can you dig it	9
1	this remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound but the only way top hear aoxomoxoa is to find a original w7 \( warner brothers seven arts \) green label vinyl pressing the cd features the 1971 remix \( like the 1989 cd \) in which 1 3 of the backing has been stripped like constanten 's prepared backrounds on what 's become of the baby the extra drums and barbershop vocal on doin that rag st stephen lost something in the remix as well anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on cd no hidden goodies on this disc but the bonus tracks are great	9
1	this album is simply one of the coolest things around and when i listened to it it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method what this basically is are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly indian middle eastern oriental festivals they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice you get indian gamelan mussette accordion vocal choruses foreign tongue talking and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track and then some it 's very trippy and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason get this for your own good	9
1	saw this fella in 'you see me laughin' on ifc good straight ahead delta style blues this is the real deal	9
1	i bought this cd six months ago because i am a miami vice fan i did n't expect it to be good but it is wonderful quot in dulce decorum quot is incredible ! this is a hard to find cd you will love it ! i enjoy it more with each playing	9
1	for anyone who loves trumpet music as i do this album is a must wynton marsalis has mastered twenty all time favorite pieces with such brilliance that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison opening with j clarke 's the king 's march wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as purcell 's entrada from the indian queen j clark 's the prince of denmark 's march and j stanley 's trumpet voluntary fantastic selections from bach mozart and haydn follow with the album also including such delightful listening as the last rose of summer carnival of venisee and flight of the bumblebee you wo n't be disappointed with this purchase	9
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now	9
1	this album gives me goosebumps i got it because of eric dolphy but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than eric dolphy alone \( though he 's excellent as usual \) the inclusion of booker ervin gives the album the perfect texture as his style in many ways contradicts that of dolphy although the styles are different they complement each other perfectly mal waldron is a great composer and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album the song thirteen is a fine example you 'll just have to listen to it everyone on this album smokes get this you wont regret it	9
1	i am not jewish but you do n't have to be to enjoy these songs this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album each and every song on here is wonderful some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music and each artist has a page about them including a photograph i highly recommend this album to just about everyone my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs music truly is borderless	9
1	i recently discovered joyce cooling yeah i 've been in the dark ages she is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else i especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations she 's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot you can hear it all in her music buy revolving door ! you 'll love it	9

1	this is a very well done record by 3 of raps most elite personalities cube dub mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record the beats are amazing on all the tracks this is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button for me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them if you 're a fan of the whole west coast gangsta rap thing you gotta have this ! my fav tracks are all the critics in new york do you like criminals gangsta 's make the world go round westward ho ! hoo bangin' although like i said all the tracks are badass peac	9
1	tosca 's suzuki is not breaking any ground but by god they have mastered the art this album is just so professional sounding very nicely produced this is how i envision trance to sound like so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this funky bassbeats and killer sounds it 's what they call ethereal i think it flows so well from track to track quite the odyessy in under an hour	9
1	immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin if you like cajun music this is for you if you like western swing this is for you if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant then this is for you ! classical \? jazz \? blues \? country rock \? then yeah you guessed it this is for you ! this is an absolutely fantastic album a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today 's greatest violinists pure genius	9

1	fournier plays exquisitely imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise although his interpretation is romantic the spirit is all bach with no egoism on the part of fournier there is both serenity and tension in these recordings and fournier 's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available	9
1	marias and srayle if you like the guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the winston personally i think the winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on guaraldi 's works the piano is brillaint sounding and at volume thru a good system sounds like there 's a piano in the room it should be emphatically understood you are buying winston in this case and not guaraldi i have both versions	9

1	i first heard this album in the late 6o 's when it was originally released starting with the first track quot blood of the sun quot i was hooked leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure his throaty singing and driving band featuring felix pappalardi made this band one that should be placed on the list of quot great ones quot probably due to the many other better publicized bands like led zeppelin and the like leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet open the closet you guitarists out there and give this cd a try i do n't think you will be anything but delighte	9
1	like louis jordan his less well known contemporary jump jive artist cab calloway fits into an area much beloved by americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre rock and roll music though in truth i do love jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of r amp b calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive jump music ca n't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart	9

1	as one of the founding fathers of today 's heavy metal rock music iron butterfly has them power drive and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music this live album serves as a testament to that fact eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960 's through the mid 1980 's was primative at best \( by today 's standards \) this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart topping group of that era this is a must have for all iron butterfly fans	9

1	if you 're a fan of latin music and especially spanish guitar you will love cafe tropical every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar to piano violin trumpet and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments every time i put this cd on i hear new things which i find makes for an even more enjoyable listen as usual johannes linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself highly recommended	9

1	not as epically gorgeous as 'once upon a time in america' but still lovely there 's a south american influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack my favourite track is an ave maria in guarani haunting however gabriel 's oboe is the theme that makes this score being an oboist it of course holds a particular appeal to me and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to	9

1	i absolutely loved the string music on track 3 i remembered it from an old pc rpg called quest for glory iv i was disappointed to find out that track 4 was only a minute and a half long because i grew up loving that song from the various places i heard it \( fantasia and a kid detective pc game from the late 80 's \) overall though grieg 's greatest hits is a must have for collectors of classical music grieg is revered as norway 's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines	9
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french the music is relaxing but not sleep inducing steven halpern composes great music	9

1	not only do you get some great music with this cd you get the beginnings of climax as well \( the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1 2 of the band that would play on climax records \) includes their 4 hits \( time wont let me girl in love respectable help me girl \) and a slew of other very like minded material if you like any of their 4 hits you will love the rest if you like climax you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes	9

1	we really liked the cd of music from the sound track of the movie elf it was what we expected and we appreciated getting it promptly since it is christmas music and we we able to enjoy it all through the holiday season	9
1	this album has some of the best country songs in the business mark sings songs straight from his heart there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like quot too cold at home quot quot i 'll think of something else quot and quot almost goodbye quot to the fast heels kicking quot bubba shot the jukebox quot and quot going through the big 'd' quot these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart so if you 're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they 're gone this is the album for you	9
1	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	9
1	do i mean the best album or the best singer \? you are correct if you said both ! i saw kristin chenoweth on a pbs show broadway 's best at the pops \( though it was not the first time i had heard her \) and decided to check out the offerings here this is a collection of the kind of music and performances i love she has a great range a precise pitch and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself in an era when singers try to outdo each other re interpreting the composer 's original work not usually with great success she is a blessing	9
1	i really enjoyed the song kids in america by no secrets both of my children enjoyed it as well in fact i have been looking for their cd or for more information on them i thought they were cute fresh and brought a new touch to the song	9

1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell 's the cadenzas are absolutely awesome i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician highly recommended	9
1	this is one of the truly great handel opera recordings of the last twenty years as usual nicholas mcgegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest handelian conductors of our time the singing from beginning to end is first class this opera is known for the famous largo ombra mai fu but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight	9
1	love this album every song is awesome ! this is the kind of album you play over and over because you feel great after listening to it my favorites are in a moment and know half past forever rocks !	9
1	link this cd of great melodies with the best of the browns \( 1954 1967 \) you 'll not regreat the quality such easy listening this group is simply the best i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book looking back to see a country music memoir it 's a well written \( and interesting \) cover of the the history of the browns	9
1	and he know 's nothing about popular music and really should get back to work and stop sitting around convincing himself that he does dumbass	9
1	i originally purchased this cd at a local store so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all	9
1	this truly is a masterpiece of pop music there is not a wasted moment the songs all blend together majestically one after the other you really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect i agree with the reviewer that stated that 'do n't look back' is one of the best songs i have ever heard i told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays i do n't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart i had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive	9

1	together with 'the best of kool amp the gang' t h i s is the ultimate bit of funk that i 've found so far the tracks may not always have a quot song structure quot \( and for me the women singers may be omitted \) the funkiest bits in history are found here ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	in august 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group main singer was tony burrows of ivy league and flowerpot men fame the first success came with the second single united we stand this cd collects together the three us hits of the session group plus the only us hit of the group that was the face of the session group in concert during 1971 1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group the eurovision winning song save your kisses for me the rest of the songs are a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974 1980 this outfit is still on tour at the end of the centur	9
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	9
1	this is one of his older cds but one of my favorites the music is smooth and wonderful to listen to great cd after a long day or to play on a special night	9

1	i am new to ron sexsmith where have i been \? this cd is outstanding and so soothing the instrumentals are soul syrup the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries nuts and fudge sauce it is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving i am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before i fall asleep at night and that waking up means i get to hear his comfort food again this honeymoon will last forever fall in love folks it 's worth the risk calorie free i promise thanks ron god speed !	9

1	this will be short it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr duet carolina shout that being said all of the other tracks on this album are excellent from jungle blues to doug wamble 's solo guitar on autumn lamp with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden 's art a must have branford keeps outdoing himself	9

1	yes the beatles by which i'm not comparing supergrass to them no supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks david bowie the zombies and many others but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's and without doubt represent the bohemia intellectual hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa sgt pepper an intoxicating and highly addictive album 100 recommended for anyone any age	9

1	mountain music offers what alabama is famous for great music and great harmony all packaged together the title cut is great that harmonica and quot old man of the mountain quot intro is unique as for quot close enough to perfect quot if any man sings that song to his lady she is his forever the cuteness of quot never be one quot also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it there is n't a bad song on the whole cd and will make a good addition to any collection	9

1	hands down a 5 star two thumbs up classic joint after it dropped puba reigned supreeeme disregard the amazon reviewer there are no gaffes in this one period these guys were true to their beliefs they were n't packaging a product for pop consumption they were telling a generation what they thought check it out and the music will speak for itself the best track in my opinion was wake up but the whole album was great as someone else mentioned fast tracks put it in the 90 's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever	9

1	i wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film \? my guess is that they did not the film was enhanced by the james horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle it is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match by the way the bigwigs at universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed ! wonderful music	9
1	what can i say about vince gill that his many fans have n't already mentioned i had never been particularly interested in country music but one day i was listening to a country radio station and vince gill was singing quot when ever you come around quot and i was hooked this cd is as consistant as all his others great lyics and superb musicianship i rate this five stars as i believe gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today	9

1	this album has new meaning to me now in 2007 where i go to a college next to a high school where i see a bunch of punk rockers spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness there are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of social distortion alive but sometimes their music is hard to find and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire albums like this exist for times like those just stick it in turn up the volume and rock out	9

1	i do n't like this album as much as their earlier stuff i have liked each release less than the previous and this one falls right in line with that trend the opener quot quality revenge quot is one of their best songs hands down though this is a very good cd but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music	9
1	what makes a voice distinctive and memorable \? nat \( king \) cole i believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his aside from 'unforgettable' the songs i best remember are 'mona lisa' and 'nature boy' but this recording also includes originals of the 'nat king cole trio' it also includes the famous duet put together of 'unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter natalie cole 's recording made after he had passed on that particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful	9
1	this is their best studio album what more can i say \? brokedown palace may be the most beautiful rock song of all time a must	9
1	i admit when i listened to this album i was blown away by the powerful content of kenny g 's music i was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during the movie kenny g 's music is perfect for this kind of movie not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show this is the perfect soundtract for the movie dying young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie	9
1	that nigga 's crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs but it would still rank high if it was n't for the poor sound quality there 's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time but some great classic bits and believe me you 're never bored	9

1	excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic dutch band each tune was a single sometime between 1965 69 these guys are not to be confused with a u s band from the same era of the same name cuts that make this cd a true keeper are sun 's going down the tripping feel like i wanted to cry keep on trying the familiar sounding touch and ballad of john b this is yet another band i 've heard at least one or two tracks on the rhino release of 'original artyfacts nuggets ii' 4 cd box set should appeal to fans of pretty things q65 early beatles creation and the action a must have	9

1	all of the isleys early work without the younger isleys is just as good with them but these early workouts are more raw stripped down and pop oriented ron isley has a way of making country and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded not too many black artists can do that to get a taste of the quot real isleys quot before the quot mr biggs quot persona get this with quot get into something quot and quot givin' it back quot	9
1	julieta venegas did it again she scored an album that is not alternative in style however it is very catchy pop music her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on you can sing along and express day to day feelings julieta continues to use instruments i like such as the harmonica and of course julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances my personal favorite is me voy a very positive song about a not so positive event breaking up keep up the good work julieta your songs are appreciated	9

1	this cd was well worth the wait ! it contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years i took one of the cds out of the box put it in the player and within minutes my wife and i were dancing the sound quality in my judgment is solid the packaging is fun and creative and the booklet containing the cameo parkway story was an interesting read there will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era what great fun to hear the orlons chubby checker the tymes the dovells bobby rydell and dee dee sharp once again	9
1	i ca n't say enough how great this album is grant green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet his soloing on this cd is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to and for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective my favorites are quot miss ann 's tempo quot and quot blues for willarene quot it is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due	9

1	sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting its not what you would really consider to be a religious album but there are many undertones that help get the message across this point being made very clear in museum of iscariot which talks of jesus from judas' point of view rowan 's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album from low opera type to screaming in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old if you are into relaxed darkwave goth music this is a perfect album to purchase	9

1	tame 's music is all about the beat it 's what got me right from the start a grinding repetitious backbone to every song tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery tame gets rid of the verse hook standarda periodically ad libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing its an amazing album well worth purchasing	9
1	while i am not a big fan of john mclaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra i cannot deny that they really had something with this album it is something new not just an extension of miles davis they were breaking new territory there is a cohesiveness amongst the band members of course abounding with improvisational talent this is fushion but first of all it is music	9
1	i cannot stop listening to the song i saved the world today the cd is worth the price for this song alone the whole cd is great though classic eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work annie lennox gets all the attention and she deserves every bit but dave stewart certainly deserves as much they make a great team and this cd should have been given much more attention in the usa i hope they do n't take so long to do another one	9

1	excellent songwriting guitar playing and overdubbing another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive days dawning crying clown fanfare are a few such songs a few songs from wind of change something's happening and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment	9

1	from the manic whirlwind prelude to the shocking cake and sodomy portrait of an american family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable cake and sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures lunchbox is told with a twist of humor organ grinder is pleasing vocally cyclops is addictingly wild get your gunn is catchy \( if not overly insulting \) dope hat is great and fierce and my monkey is hysterically enjoyable snake eyes and sissies is another winner easy to get lost in the rest all work to varying degrees though not as appealing every song on this album is worth listening to from fast paced and rock style to techno overload	9
1	i love to working with this soundtrack in the back ground the music is fun whimsical and out of the ordinary i like pop and rock but sometimes you just need good music without the lame lyrics	9

1	stephen stills for what it 's worth is of course a classic song burned neil young 's strongest effort for this album is another classic song the rest of it is all very good i would say that it does sound a bit dated however and that this one is mostly for fanatics of 60 's music your average artic monkeys fan is not going to find this a good match for their musical sensiblities better was on the way from buffalo springfield their next album buffalo springfield again is an all out rock masterpiece that everybody should own whatever your age or inclinations	9
1	the dead were primarily a live road band but on this and the other great album from 1970 \( american beauty \) the band proved their mettle in the studio moving into less spacey territory the music reflects their range from country and bluegrass to folk blues and rock superb ps their early studio effortsanthem aoxomoxoa \) were also noteworthy experiments but the music was n't as powerful as the live interpretations	9
1	sing of mary is a work of art ! the beauty of the music is only surpassed by the woman it praises mary ! god bless this cd	9
1	but not the only one you should get make this a purchase but get live dead also because it has all different songs and then look at other live releases the dead have a lot of good recordings just pick and choose among them this one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection it is amazing how many good songs they have and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff but you ca n't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it is n't up to scratch	9

1	this is the type of music to sit down relax put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious from spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion this is just a taste of what is supersilent and from what i hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off all this coming from someone who has never heard them before talk about a great buy ! highly highly recommended i close my eyes to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body drunk with the infinite beauty i sigh without a mouth and think	9
1	aretha 's voice her style delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable these songs are more than just classics they 're a songbook to millions of people 's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60 's and 70 's as i did they evolk memories of times that changed our world and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come there is not much that came before and very little that came after these golden years for aretha that can compare to this treasury of her music sadly the aretha frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the aretha franklin of this time who was truly and rightfully the queen of soul	9

1	pablo is definitely the babe ruth moses of these pieces however tempo cadence clarity consistency and emotional projection are much better here starker is at least the michael jordan of the bach suites and compared to pablo \( i heard the naxos one \) the sound quality on this disc is the right hand of god starker is the dog 's balls big ones like a great dane	9
1	as always opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these bach cello suites starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this cd that this edition the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not technically perfect but in many ways his most mature interpretation you can spend hundreds trying to find a mercury copy of the perfect rendition or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist at the height of his humanistic understanding of music and of life	9

1	i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re released if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia this is the set for you !	9
1	an outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across mexico this set examines both traditional and contemporary music including a brilliant ska banda mix by the popular quot rock en espanol quot band cafe tacuba rancheras corridos boleros indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented and even a few sones from veracruz one of my favorite musical genres ! if you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation then check this collection out it might open more than a few new musical doors	9
1	now i know what you 're thinking why are there two releases of xx \? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re released the album xx but they also re recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals \( big mistake ! \) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !	9

1	i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available surprise turned to shock when i saw the price does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world \( including south africa where i live \) who are very keen on this album \? at this stage though it is only the very wealthy that can afford it	9
1	this is the first cd i 've bought in the liquid mind series but after hearing this one i 'll buy more the music is calming and soothing great to fall asleep by which i often do it lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day it makes me think of floating on a cloud i would highly recommend this cd for anyone with a busy stressed out life	9
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco' and its accompaning popularity it is nice \( and a relief \) i might add to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva which are difficult to find anywhere also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces this is truly pure flamenco at its best	9

1	one of the great metal albums of our time from the drumming to the guitar alls that can be said is amazing	9
1	bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz he is also one of the most creative on this album he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning move has a smaller more focused sound that it 's predecessors and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion bravo !	9

1	i received the piano promptly and in pristine excellent condition	9
1	this album grabbed my attention from the first measure thick and heavy this is not like any blues album i 've ever heard very atypical for hidalgo as well this one is probably an acquired taste one for the truly hard core blues fan the sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start and the more i listen to it the more i like it i can only hope there 's a houndog 2 in the works	9
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey and personally like a lay 's potato chip not able to listen to just one yeah i need the whole thing	9
1	my husband and i play this cd all the time we both love it	9
1	i have been a fan for jaci velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages i do not speak spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less this album lived up to the velasquez name in my book my family and i only really enjoy the traditional sounding christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions jaci 's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my christmas traditions ! overall i love this album and the only reason i did not give it a full five stars was that i am done with that chipmunk song sorry everybody	9
1	i bought this for my kids because i knew they would love these songs just as i did forget them ! i love it ! there is nothing like the chipmunks and never will be again the christmas song is worth the price alone do n't think about it just get it	9
1	for those who have watched the movie jaws \( ask yourself who has n't \) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information which gives the overall package a nice touch the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	9
1	i have just purchased this cd \( the day it came out ! \) and from what i 've heard it is amazing surpassing \( but not replacing \) boulez 's earlier recording if you are a fan of boulez 20th century music or music in general this is a must get	9
1	this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal who has been recording for ecm for 30 years now the tracks range from pieces with an quot electric miles quot sound to an orchestrated track while very diverse the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique atmospheric tone and excellent compositions the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering informative liner notes as well highly recommended	9
1	the coltrane soundscapes that this cd is infused flies to the mountain and back again that 's the truth but one troubling question for me remains no matter how much i enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters \( new old \) where in the world is alan holdsworth \? if any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the coltrane moniker it 's holdsworth for years he 's been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order including holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do	9
1	this cd is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing my favorite track is is n't it romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song buy it now ! !	9
1	if you want some classical music to sleep to do n't buy this cd if you want some high energy symphonies however i highly recommend it from bach to vivaldi the pure energy of this cd will give you a new understanding of the joys of classical music just do n't listen to track 25 because i have no idea why john philip sousa is included with tchaichovsky	9
1	this is one of the most beautiful restorative collections of celtic music i have ever heard haunting sublime harp cello guitar flute and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation prayer or simply unwinding the mind and emotions the poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself highly recommended	9
1	juice newton is one of the best counry pop singers of all times a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartacheafter all these years her work is unforgettable catchy and full of energy and vibe	9
1	i like this album its got a nice mix of old and new material along with some live material great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game	9
1	this is a great album two of their biggest hits another one bites the dust and crazy little thing called love are here my favorites are need your loving tonight and prime jive most of the other songs are top notch too none of the later queen albums matched this one definitely in the class of night at the opera day at the races and news of the world	9
1	the band is excellent and this album is just shy of the high quality of the first however the encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the major record companies will not stop until they see a negative financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products do n't support these products	9
1	david foster who wrote a few tunes on yes 's time and a word is here on bass with tony kaye on the b3 and it 's the performance of their lives captured live at the rainbow a brave but good way to record a debut album album was produced by jon anderson and the cover drawn by roger dean just like yes it gives you feeling that tony left yes on good terms when rick wakeman stepped in	9

1	i have listened to this cd for the last several years before going to sleep at night i love classical music and this is great music to help make my soul feel at peace and unwind after a taxing day	9
1	forget the nit picky comments you may read here if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album buy it ! the recording is of very high quality and i agree with another review vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better the banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live one other observation if you buy this not having a huge appreciation for sammy already you will be blown away by his talent thanks to sinatra family for releasing this disc hopefully many more are forthcoming	9
1	if you really into french baroque that is	9
1	if you like post modern lounge music you will like the tracks on this disc	9
1	these tunes may not immediately remind you of steve miller but his talent is not belied it 's some really peaceful music great to turn on just at bedtime and drift off to la la land	9
1	this record is a fine example of earnest juju music other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards chief commander obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife keep in mind this means amazing percussion work intertwining guitar lines loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals if you 're interested you should buy it it will make you happy no matter how you were feeling and what you 're doing	9

1	incredible follow up to rated r which i did n't think could be equaled and they did flat out incredible songwriting amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best if you grew up in the 70 's as i did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you go with the flow is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you wo n't be skipping any songs on this disc baby boomers rejoice rock is back	9
1	i bought this the year it came out after seeing george in concert and it is great ! most of these were big hit songs and i found that i really loved the others too especially hard day	9
1	this album has morse code on it what more can you say well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres complete with t6 buzz and slow drift and the music is pretty good too	9
1	my one complaint is that after i listen to this cd the catchy tunes get stuck in my head ! and then i want to keep listening to it more and more i love the selections on this cd the fact that the songs are in english \( i always wondered what the figaro figaro figaro song was about ! \) and that a little background is given to each piece as well	9

1	this is a must have for anyone with an r b oldies collection you wo n't be disappointed	9

1	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues he was and is a great rocker but his true calling is as a bluesman this is a great album	9
1	this is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic lyrical wizardry was the order of the day if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic the production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other buy this ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	the original jack johnson lp was my favourite miles record i also had an expensive japanese cd but all this would not prepare me for what i discover here over these cds one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made this is simply wonderful ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time	9

1	i first heard joe playing in that urgent style of his on horace silvers' quot song for my father quot album the thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed like he was born to play on this cd felicidade in particuliar he simmers builds to a rolling boil and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to brasil also the straight ahead playing on triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by the group ! the whole is cd is great go 'head joe	9
1	i got the pleasure of seeing albert open for bb king unfortunately for bb king because once albert started playing his flying v with blues power he demoralized anybody that came after him he had the entire universal amphitheater standing and stayed standing for most of his show blues power is one of his best get listen and then really listen because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes	9
1	any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission these pieces each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for quot new age quot sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully crafted music weave its web it 's quot feel good quot music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor	9
1	herb alpert has done what few artists can do he 's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original i love the original whipped cream but this cd is a masterstroke combining alpert 's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end unlike some of the purists i loved this cd and you will too	9
1	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try i am happy with all of the tracks some tracks remind me of beatles a little but not all so the band does have a unique sound even though from the 90s the sound is like many bands making it today i like it	9
1	what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style he is careful not to over do it while still demonstrating skill and precision his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs i rarely make it to the end of this cd still for those who enjoyed quot a go go quot this one is quite similar so make sure to pick it up this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking but is a great casual listen \( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !	9
1	dj quik \( the best producer ever \) did all the tracks in this one with help from robert bacon on some tracks this album is just classic nuthin more to it !	9
1	3rd force 's new cd quot force field quot is their first new cd in a few years the track quot revelation of the heart quot sets the tone for this wonderful recording a must have to add to your collection	9
1	a ridiculously good album this is as good an introduction to jawbox as you 're going to find it 's got most of their really great songs plus some live songs which are great another good thing is that desoto records \( the label that was started by the band \) has re released the cd so it should n't be as hard to find	9
1	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's swanee and rock a bye although every track is just excellent the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby	9

1	disappear fear 's music is both calming and uplifting at the same time i especially enjoyed laws of nature because of it lyrics \( it has a gay rights lyrics \) does anyone know which one of the singers is gay \? i would be quite greatful for the answer if anyone knows would you mind posting it under the reviews here \? thanx that would be great !	9
1	i do n't see how they can compare these guys to the mars volta or coheed and cambria i can hear the prog elements but it 's more of a rush kind of prog rock shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics they are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band the songs just are n't as epic as a tmv or a c amp c song i think reviewers liken brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice this is still an amazing album that is well worth your time go into it expecting sparta rather than the mars volta and you wo n't be disappointed	9
1	when this album first came out i felt jilted but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album make no mistake if you 're a die hard 80 's rocker you 'll hate this album the production is raw and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed but that does n't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record if you can keep an open mind i think this ablum is one that you 'll love	9
1	dream is a great album where keller coloboarates with many of his favorite musicians including bob wier bella fleck victor wooten and string cheese incident all the songs are unique and great to sing too while driving or anytime !	9
1	well this is n't at the gates nightrage reminds me of many old arch enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic of course that leads into gus g substituting chris on concerts being an excellent choice as they make very similar melodies some people say this album is heavy which it is in some parts but its melodic death there are no signs of thrash or anything just great melodies great headbanging music add this to your collection i think its better than sweet vengeance	9
1	chris joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms afros and platform shoes ! joss' you 've been spiked is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever ! in fact this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70 's but it 's all circa the 21st century it 's good to know that there are still modern cats \( especially on the esl record label \) who know how to recapture music from days gone by	9
1	this is a fabulous cd and exactly what i was looking for i'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music i am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the songs before so i wanted the traditional melodies easy to follow sheet music and easy guitar chords this is perfect ! i'm so pleased	9
1	this is by far the best psychopathic album ever released riddlebox is now in second place madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless ! great flows and he mixes funny with wicked best songs are this b tch and hey phatty great album by the best rapper of our time madrox is so under rated i wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process buy this album best rap album ever made	9
1	percy grainger was a man of spectacular gifts he was one of the most original composer arrangers in the early part of this century he was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists this amazing cd documents grainger 's formidible gifts it cannot be over praised both the music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover 's attention do n't miss this one	9
1	i own a lot of waylon jennings albums but i have to say i find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10 times if you want to buy just one waylon album this is the one to own the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and the music is alive simply great i ca n't say enough good things about this cd	9
1	considered one of coltrane 's 'searching' periods this cd has a lot to offer in the way of understanding trane 's restless nature never one to stand on laurels coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out this one is mostly ballad and blues based with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out on both ends of the trane spectrum track 2 i love you finds him playing furious cerebral runs on the instrument and frankly not as 'listenable' as one may like whereas the track with donald byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you 'll ever hear all in all a very realistic look at a genius in motion	9
1	the cd is truly the very best of bobby vee 's works a delightful cd even my college age children enjoy the music really worth the money	9
1	this album is ridiculous i almost want to say part of srv 's soul is in this guy he is that good honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two my hope is that jimmy dt and apo will bring out a 4th release as good as this album or better ! this is one of those great albums where every song is good buy it you like srv buy it double trouble must have brought part of srv back because this album is just plain sweet	9
1	i am not sure about my baby but i love this cd ! actually baby loves it too but probably not to that great extent	9

1	the best place to start with the best is at the beginning enya 's the celts \( identical to the original 1980s release simply called enya \) is a beautiful collection of music enya is not an artist where you just get the best of album every cd is a best of in itself	9
1	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker his band rocked ! after basie nobody swung like mcshann this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides anything by this man is worth listening to another great disc by the proper label who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price highly recommended	9
1	unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide and fortified roots reggae album ! if you do n't have firehouse rock in your cd collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan you may need to re evaluate what you think you know about jamaican music the roots radics especially the rythym section utilize \( with supreme efficacy i might add \) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae riddims on top of the radics the wailing souls add ethereal vocals while staying masterfully conscious firehouse rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible jamaican history and an absolute must have	9
1	you wo n't stop bobbin yo head until its over i bought this when it first came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is happy to hear it cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was he just never got the exposure that biggie did	9

1	jigga is incredibly hot on this albumbeanie is good to great memphis bleek is really good on this album but is overshadowed his 534 shows how good he is this album does not overall as an album it does a good job of showing off roc a fella but not to much about the dynasty	9
1	i just purchased this album my first misfits album and every song on it rocks \( i especially like where eagles dare \) i just bought two more albums walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait my only complain is the sound quality it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking but i guess that makes it sound more real too metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same	9
1	i usually do n't do album reviews but i gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call quot the sauce quot so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings word of mouth is bliss a g 2 a ke who came out on rap a lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic i'm salty they did n't quot make it quot because this was heavily slept on	9
1	vangelis themes is a collection of some rare and some more popular theatrical theme music from movies including blade runner and mutiny on the bounty it 's an extraordinary album and i highly recommend it	9
1	if you are looking for true hip hop this is a must for your collection four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd quit buying those fake ass hip pop albums and get the real deal from the production to mcing its all there matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks	9
1	i never loved a man the way i love you what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time this album released all of the music in aretha that was screaming to be released it displayed a very mature aretha with complex emotions very everyday lyrics ones that make you say oh yeah girl lol but also a delivery that the average person could n't lay down and dream about pulling off this is just testiment that even at such a young age she was the queen	9
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now there 's great gentle interplay with jim hall and a total sound that is most enjoyable warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone	9
1	this music is undefinable ultimately oh yes one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive one can say many things about it for me this along with up the downstairs are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day i 've become a collector of pt 's stuff and like most of it very much indeed check out some of the side projects of the members in the band like blackfield and no man they are worth good listenings too but you know this would n't be a bad album to start your pt experience with no not at all	9
1	jeff beck is far from the typical rock guitarist he never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is instead he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen to this cd over and over again that 's what musicianship is all about and jeff has plenty of it	9
1	this cd is the funniest cd i own the first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny the second half is a little hard to understand and it louds like is was recorded poorly that is why i gave it four stars track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy eddie makes fun of stevie wonder and boxer larry holmes and he does it well	9
1	i love fool for the city i have also always loved savoy brown looking in and did n't know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat if you are a foghat fan you should check out looking in by savoy brown if you 've heard other stuff by savoy brown and did n't like it do n't be discouraged because looking in \( and only looking in \) is essentially foghat there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best	9
1	i drive alot commuting to and from my job this music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely indiana fall ! i'm sure i 'll recall those colorful images as i continue to listen to this cd through the colorless days of winter	9
1	joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r b history he 's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles elton john and gary wright his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs but in dts 5 1 you are surrounded \( as if in concert \) by his presence the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you 'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album	9
1	you have not heard his voice until to have heard andras schiff play the well tempered clavie	9
1	the guitars are n't loud enough and neither is the bass for that matter which is so true but it 's still a great album seeing them live makes up for this cd no doubt stand out songs the city sleeps in flames the world as we know it just a taste my darkest hour empty glasses the only medicine'my darkest hour' 'empty glasses' are my favorites i know those songs by heart	9
1	while not every song my be my favorite they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days ! all the monster cds i have bought have been real gems	9
1	a truly glorious recording just what i want in music with brilliancy sensitivity and beauty this is a must have for every music lover worth the name	9
1	her voice takes my breath away i fell in love with her i highly reccomend it	9
1	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time surprisingly evans' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings highlights are the amazing quot waltz for debby quot and earl zindars' waltz quot elsa quot easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written in my opinion you simply cannot go wrong with this cd	9
1	good stuff ! an excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes artfully performed by jorgenson i recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of john jorgenson and the genius of django reinhardt	9
1	i would like to point out that mtv rocks is funny and you guys are suckers this album does rule just not as much as top40 radio hits	9
1	i'm not particularly familiar with sonic youth and the bits i 've heard from their other albums have n't really grabbed me this does the rhythm section would n't be out of place in pseudo tribal funk the guitars are dissonant jangling sometimes hypnotically repetitive and just plain weird and the vocals are distant airy lazy some of the best music i 've heard in a good long while	9
1	this is pure inspirational quintessential oteil and the peacemakers it 's gospel funk jazz rock features his distinctive scatting and amazing bass a wonderful blend of talent glorious vocals you will not regret this purchase it 's a joy all the way through from beginning to end	9
1	i 've been waiting for this one this disc and this group period was funky movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period can you see the light is a tight jam as well one of the many bad groups from back in the day	9
1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is 'is it for me' it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful \( at most times \) pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums	9
1	i have been looking for a particular song for several years this album had it	9
1	his playing on this album reminds me of that of bill evans i am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought comparison to bill evans is the best compliment i know how to give	9
1	i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny mono phonograph i loved it then and i love it now rainmaker i'm on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles i would have loved you anyway is the only song i do n't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that 's ok ! the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy ! i do n't care if it 's the memories or not i enjoy putting this on and turning it up	9
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two after applying one vial it seemed even worse than before \( tread catches as i walk \) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable \( still not great \) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality	10
0	this stuff has a very strong smell like wd 40 or something if you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought but it is n't odorless it really stinks i do n't like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room i recommend the lifespan 100 silicone lubricant it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it 's the good \( odorless \) stuff	10

0	i consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big i think that for a small backpack that they are just too large thank you	10
0	i returned this item as it did n't fit my 19 pound boston terrier well at all it was way too large for his body small obviously means small for a larger dog instead just be aware !	10

0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
0	i guess you get what you pay for this pedometer was difficult to calibrate and continued to miscount steps and therefore distance covered it is made of plastic and came unclipped easily i am a big person and have started walking to improve my health this product does not work for me although it might be a different story for a slim person it has been relegated to the junk drawer and probably will eventually be thrown away i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it	10
0	initially the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate it did however give my wife a good laugh she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote but after one week of use the darn thing became so in sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick pass on this one	10

0	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know besides it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! \( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 for example i own a 3 9x44 scope this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom the second number refers to the size of the scope lens i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight \( peephole \)	10

0	the wood is very nice but the design manufacturing is very poor my experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating the holes are n't properly pre drilled the hole at the top did n't match up with the cap plate hole which a \) made it very difficult to screw together \( the first screw stripped \) and b \) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly i experienced the same issue with shallow pre drilled holes in the bottom and the bolts not going in all the way i never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions based on the wobbly central column i decided to disassemble mine and send it back	10
0	when i was assembling this product i discovered that not only were the instructions vague and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured the predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height my thought is how hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth \? luckily i own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers \? i wish i could give this product a higher rating but hopefully there are better alternatives	10
0	this pillow is too small and it is not comfortable at all	10
0	i bought these skates last year with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them when i tried to take the wheels off they would n't budge ! spend the extra 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years when the indoor wheels on these die the skates die too these most definitely are not roller derby skates since those girls change their wheels all the time !	10
0	i bought these skates for my daughter from sport authority since we both wear the same size i decided i would try and skate in them after my daughter she complained the wheels would not roll and when i tried to loosen them with a skate tool they would n't loosen at all i tried to skate in them as well and i almost fell on my face i was n't expecting the same quality as my professional skates but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely !	10
0	i am a huge ski person and i got the jump it is so small for me because i am do like 50 feet drops all the time my suggestion this is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things not ideal what so ever for skiing i got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard not skiing	10
0	this may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6 8 but an older child would laugh at this one i was embarrassed to even give it to my son	10
0	it wasnt very good and it didnt tell how bad it wqa	10
0	there was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts my son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road he could not it is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface	10
0	this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard first of all i thought this would be a bit larger when i tried to go off of the ramp my nose hit the front of it not only is it not fun but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around if you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard i recommend something else	10
0	it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid	10
0	not very bright for an led and guess what \? this is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so i do n't blame amazon but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this	10
0	i got four boxes of these matches so i was motivated to learn how to use them i had read the directions about poking them into the lid i tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes it burned down to the wood portion and went out incidentally these matches are very short perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter	10
0	the title pretty much says it all the bag is solid and did n't get too soft even after a good amount of use the big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and ca n't support the weight of the bag one of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability all within about six months of use unless you 're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them i 'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag	10
0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work \( or weather \) complications if you are like me that means weekdays late at night or very early in the morning i'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes my neighbors ca n't stand it hey i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner to give you an idea i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models	10
0	mitts no good tore up in two weeks inside came out very displease	10
0	seems i may have already broke this bar twisted it to stop it from spinning while i was doing exercise and heard a pop now it spins all the time i use it not happy \( i did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already	10
0	for 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking jogging with a bonus pedometer the radio has no channel display and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial then a scan button when walking it loses the station occasionally luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial but if yours is n't this could be terribly annoying as for the pedometer it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when i was holding it perfectly still thus worthless i'm sending it back	10
0	i'm a big fan of topeak 's gear i own two of their racks couple of pumps bags etc i use the mtx trunk bag panniers to commute and i live in florida so i needed rain cover i purchased this and to my surprise topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie yes the cover is yellow yes there 's a reflective triangle but that 's not the same as a blinkie gee topeak do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain \? stupid lack of planning	10
0	after only one or two uses the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts rending themselves completely useless i'm very disappointed as i have another set of cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years i would not recommend buying this set of clubs	10
0	i bought this set after reading the positive reviews but i must say that i am terribly disappointed two of iron broke \( yes broke ! \) while i was practicing in the range its completely worthless and i strongly suggest to stay away from this set	10
0	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit i am sending the gps i just purchased along with this software back to amazon the software will not communicate with the gps and the company will not respond to any of my support requests the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available and the live technical support is a complete joke after 20 minutes of being on hold i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english and offered me no help i knew more about the software than him and i 've only owned it 3 days i 'll never purchase from magellan again	10
0	did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike it should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate	10
0	overall poor quality in craftsmanship one can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed the wood is of subpar quality as well the price is low however i would not recommend these swords	10
0	please do n't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy it is tiny ! the hinges and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon the jewels never sink either interestingly pooltoy does n't list the size of this product in fact they do n't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing what a rip off i hope amazon discontinues its association with this company look at the feedback record for them it 's as terrible as this toy is	10
0	if you order this sword you may not get what you see yes you will get the same 'style' of sword but as for the look forget it the steel is pure black now if that 's what you want great i personally wanted the 'silver' steel look but got the 'jet black' steel do n't worry it was the same sword just a different color	10
0	hi i am highly regretting buying this mat it is too bulky to carry and it came on sale in big 5 for half the price of amazon	10
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail refused package a month ago exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them since amazon takes no responsibility vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel refund order amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you're stuck with erroneous charges beware ! !	10
0	amazon has the brand mislabeled as apex but it is ipex cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight the rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart the chrome paint is already peeling before even one use also buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time the maximum weight on each is 15lbs \( if i would have thought about it when i purchased it i would have realized both of these \) overall very poor quality i will try to return	10
0	we bought this for my 7yr old son and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it thank goodness we had it on a tile floor he kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water ! what a mess not worth the money	10
0	the idea is great for my son who studies karate but the quality of the product is below sub par the pump broke two pumps into blowing the thing up i spent the better part of the night hallucinating while blowing up this thing everyday it had to be blown up again without the pump ! i told my son it was garbage and said he could practice on his big sister don't cheap out with this	10
0	i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one im not buyin a swiss air mattress agai	10
0	works as advertised except one of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day no particular stress applied or anything i'm going to allen to see if i can get a replacement that was my only complaint otherwise it 's fine then again breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint	10
0	the frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike i have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter derailer brakes and other small items this bike is not schwinn 's usual quality very disapointin	10
0	i ordered the item saying it was in stock but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up i was told the item was in a back order i think they shouldnt write in stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it it delayed the item for 2 3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift though i can say the item was nice when i got it	10
0	this compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers the pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break the card \( actual compass part that spins \) wobbles a lot so it 's difficult to get an exact bearing it is like the oil in the compass is very thin also the direction line lid spins easily making it possible to take a bad reading ironically this is the silva weakness as well if you need an inexpensive engineer style compass consider the silva for a two more dollars you get an aluminum case a hinge that wo n't break and a card that does n't wobble with the slightest hand movement	10
0	this cargo carrier is so flimsy that i thought it would fall apart before i got to my destination the hinges are a joke and barely work it is also a nightmare to assemble	10
0	i think they are too stiff for comfort i do like the short finger but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff i thought it would stretch out and soften a bit but it has n't protects the hands well through off road trails though	10
0	this gun was okay when i first started using it it 's really a backyard gun and should only be used for beginners i had it on my bed which is about two feet high and it fell when my dog jumped on the barrel broke the spring in the magazine also broke there are better guns out there but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard this is the gun for you the sight is a pretty nice feature	10
0	i was very disappointed with this purchase since i have always been an under armour supporter these gloves felt like i was wearing a material that sped up the onset of frost bite to my hands ! definitely not for cold weather do n't waste your money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	10
0	i bought this based on the other review it takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor all through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft i am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated do n't waste your money like i did	10
0	they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the	10
0	bought it 2 months ago for in door usage thought it 'd last until the end of the semester after less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage punctures started to appear and the patches that came along with the package did n't help much even though the design and the built in manual pump is a big plus the quality is very disappointing	10
0	i just read an article at the fox sports website saying it is almost certain that nba will go back to using leather ball there will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens so in my opinion do n't buy it	10
0	this tablecloth bleeds as soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms ! i ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect ! go figure ! avoid these	10
0	and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery i have half the cable now good price and attractive product for a low security environment	10
0	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit anyone honestly that tells you differently is wrong	10
0	i was also disappointed that the product came without a dvd though the initial description said so but amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price appreciate their gesture agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with it took a lot of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile yeah not very happy with this product p s contrastingly had a bad experience with dell on a similar situation when i bought a nikon camera dell blamed the wrong description on nikon and expectedly nikon blamed dell neither owned up the error but amazon was pretty good i really appreciate it	10
0	my son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems but it is not for the beginner	10
0	i just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust i gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me they legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself i only paid 5 29 for it with free shipping so i ca n't complain at least my 3 month old likes to look at it i would not recommend buying this toy	10
0	terrible as a musical toy my daughter liked the colors but that was pretty much it it is difficult to squeeze the feet too cute as a stuffed animal	10
0	very disappointed it didnt play any music its own quiet difficult to squeeze	10
0	if you expect this to play music by itself you will be dissapointed basically each foot is a sqeeze horn it 's not bad a plush but as a musical toy it 's horrible	10
0	i bought this bike thinking since jeep put its name on it then it should be a great tough rock solid ride ! boy was i wrong ! not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy its mechanics are worst part after taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally 10 of its gears still do n't work now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job let me tell ya i stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still did n't work overall i 'd have to give this bike two thumbs down you 're better off buying a bike from walmart	10
0	indeed these are way too short for protecting your knuckles my boxing coach laughed when he saw them ringside make really good long wraps which are better j	10
0	these are indeed the short static hand wraps you do n't want static wraps period they 're also too short	10
0	this is my first review i just felt the need to tell people about this product these things do not have any resistance i think my 11 year old niece and do about 100 reps i 'll give it one star for comfort but that 's about it i'm not even going to return them since shipping will eat half my cost away buy something else	10
0	i thought this would be the ultimate gym bag the main compartment is too narrow your shoes will not fit side by side you have to stack them the pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough the zippers are cheap and stick it is very pretty but not very functional my 16 00 bag works much better	10
0	this key hider would n't fool my 18 month old ! with a very visible seam on the bottom it 's obvious this thing opens you can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic ! awful awful awful	10
0	about average for the price nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight the wide beam is fairly faint with a strong central spot this one will go out into the garage and likely stay there	10
0	i live in argentina i bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa the watch does n't work and i ca n't change it or sent it back to usa	10
0	first of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doese n't match what seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one at the beggining everything was ok at the end of first week the light button locked \( after a few hours i get it unlocked \) in the second week the the battery has ended i'm very disappointed	10
0	i got this for my boy scout 's birthday he really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than i thought it was i'm not sure if it is usable my son has n't tried using this yet	10
0	goal frame is okay but net is a pile of pants and does not last five mins cant seem to buy replacement	10
0	i bought this over the yakima equivalent for the locking accessory what a mistake i made the racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work i called thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to rma it i sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case but i would steer clear if i was you	10
0	even though this is a receiver hitch mount item it does not use a standard hitch pin it is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch \( must be bolted into the hitch to remove must be unbolted \) this totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch versatility the ability to easily without tools change whatever is mounted in the hitch bad thule ! bad	10
0	i bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping since i tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet i was in for a big disappointment for the price that i paid compare to the other yoga mats i was very disappointed lesson learned find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on line for those of you who sweats alot don't waste your money buying this mat	10
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it 's funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it 's stable worth it \? not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat \( 5mm model \) it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value \( reasonable price \) and it 's biodegradable	10
0	i couldnt find this item any where but amazon its all my grandson wanted i asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it he said i dont like it i asked why they arent cheep he said it doesnt soot far enough \( oh ! dylan is 7 yrs old \) hope this helps	10
0	i road this bike for the first time today i got to walk it home the gear shifter boke off into my spokes and bent the rim this bike is a unreliable piece of junk	10
0	the pedometer worked great for the first two weeks than my 1 1 2 year old snatched it off my jeans it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it it still worked but i had to be careful when i opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached last w e it stopped working completely everthing is set to 0 and wo n't move my husbands odometer seems to be working fine however i'm dissapointed for the short life span m l mcdermot	10
0	i purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and i and they both stopped working on the same day ! we only had them 10 days and when they went kaput	10
0	i ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately one only counts about half the steps i take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that i wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday i could understand if one did n't work properly but i got 2 at the same time with the same problem i would not recommend this product	10
0	this light worked for me when i used two d batteries but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions i was also unaware that the light was fender mount and was n't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light i found that replacing the front reflector with the light worked ok for me and this replacement was easy on the cruiser i have my main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet and the missing installation instructions	10
0	when i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought i havent used them since i bought them i sent in a questionairre sort of deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange but i havent heard a thing from them i'm not very pleased	10
0	the scooter came with broken brakes after numerous phone calls to razor they sent the wrong part they dont answer their phones during their open hours and the customer service is a slap in the face buy another brand !	10
0	i bought this watch because i wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size it is huge looked like i had a clock on my wrist take into consideration	10
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 usually ships in 24 hours it actually took 1 week to ship it 2 when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have leather band the band was made of artificial materials \( nylon and rubber \) or something like that i will have to return it	10
0	i do n't really write reviews but i felt like i needed to say something about this one maybe its me but i could n't get the pump to work so i bought a new basketball i bought a regular one and bought a pump i wish that infusion thing worked out because it would have been great to deflate it put it in my bag and then pump it up again at the court but my friend warned me they do n't work so good i'm just stubborn i guess that 's my 2 cents take it for what its worth	10
0	we 've gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding the gimmick is n't worth it and there are better balls like the original zi o and the excel for outdoor and the tf1000 for indoor	10
0	i was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good when it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy 's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2 4 people i kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch the pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox	10
0	this nightmare was so disappointing ! it was hard to assemble and the instructions were minimal and illegible it is an overpriced piece of junk in addition the net for the hoop was not in the box and the hoop was put on backwards my son was so upset i would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional with proper communication and some info how to contact them if there was a problem because there will definitely be a problem !	10
0	just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked the pack itself though is very nice many pocekts for keys cell phone ipod ect	10
0	small very small kit not as advertised every item needs expensive batteries	10
0	the plug that keeps the air in kept popping out we took it back and bought another one same problem so we took it back again i think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float buy one of better quality	10
0	we recieved two of these for my daughter 's first birthday she loves being in the pool but this float almost changed everything ! ! ! ! the inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up my daughter freaked out ! ! ! ! she had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this do not waste your money	10
0	when i purchased this item i got the impression that the kit \( looking at the picture \) included everything but the gazebo which is the frame you should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit i need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it the title of this item should say gazebo screen and not gazebo screen kit unhappy custome	10
0	the very day i received the armor abs 2 i used it and all the bands came loose that same day i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab	10
0	this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased i cant believe it please dont waste your time or money on this it b roke the second day rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one	10
0	not well made at all and only works half the time and the programming changes on its own i recommend spending a little more for a better piece do n't waste money on this one	10
0	not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly must have been stuck in the box too long ! husband said send it back ! needless to say we got a refund	10
0	does not work like advertised ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again it may also damage a wood or aluminum bat last time i buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon	10
0	i bought this for my 10 year old son 's birthday he was very excited about it and having derek jeter endorse it was an added treat for him we spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it we eventually concluded that it was a big disappointment the ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole i was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball i can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like jeter but imagine a 10 year old ! save your money time and child 's feelings	10
0	this is the first product i 've bought through amazon that i wish i could give a negative star rating after involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting i 've concluded this product does not work customer service cites this is a product upgrade a video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit what we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle it would barely even unwrap imagine derek jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1 5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade	10
0	this looks better on tv than it actually works the cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around when it unwinds it does so very slow and loses it 's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with \? what are you supposed to hit it with then \? these things you do n't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up do n't waste money on this item	10
0	this bike should not have the name mountain in it you can not take this bike off ride it might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails do not buy this bike	10
0	i had purchased a rifle from airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use the quality was not good but the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with it has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped i have had every excuse imaginable first they wanted me to pay for shipping then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun then they said they did not have that model any longer and i would have to pay for the higher priced model i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress the worst customer service of all time !	10
0	i would not reccommend this product i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing the unit is ok but not as good as it looks hope this was helpfu	10
0	i used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed 1 \) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2 \) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling \( luckly i noticed it floating near me when i stoped to clear my mask \) referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything i placed in the holder was saturated with water even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water in addition this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day	10
0	this tent is alright its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts i bought it in the spring and this fall with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage i do n't really think its worth the money it is very spacious just wish it was better made	10
0	i was surprised when i received what appeared to be a sales brochure i searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if i had missed the book entirely but in fact the small clumsily put together manual was in fact the 3 75 book that i bought online it has some new exercises in it but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them	10
0	i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price	10
0	this ramp set is really fun to skate on but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage first it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem the worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward making it so you have to constantly pull it back down i forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and i went flying but do n't let this turn you away it is a good fly box nonetheless but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime not a year	10
0	have received and reviewed this item i cranked it for 2 minutes the radio played no longer than 2 3 minutes then died i tried to crank it longer same results it is useless it 's large and bulky \( though very sleek and nice \) the cranking handle looks fragile and i suspect with all the cranking this toy needs it will break sooner than later bottom line do n't buy it i own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 2 minutes crank	10
0	we registered for two of these mobiles for our twins we recieved both of them upon putting them together we realized that the mobile ca n't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib ! how annoying ! we returned them both	10

0	the quality of the construction was poor i would not recomend this to anyone	10
0	i just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap but there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate what is it for i can twist without it anyway 10 mins after using the machine i got a severe knee injury i didnt have an injury before using it but i got one now i am going to have to get rid of it	10
0	i received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly but i was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball it no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper ! unless you hit the nylon target you have lost a ball ! i may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if i miss the target	10
0	i received my cage net on august 12 06 i set it up on aug 16 i hit about 50 golf balls into it and one of the tabs that holds the black tarp tore loose i then noticed that there was a hole in the netting where is the quality	10
0	i got this net and set it up in february and been using it fairly regularly i was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment ! should n't a 100 00 golf net last longer than 3 4 months \? completely unacceptable	10
0	while i like the functions this offers the screen is a bit hard to read when riding also the instructions are n't very easy to follow for example it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions do n't say how to convert to miles hour i would probably not buy this again	10
0	this seems to be a pretty low quality item i love zelda for certain but it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind unless i missed something and link 's sword really did have a plastic handle	10
0	i bought this item a few weeks before hurricane wilma hit south florida i kept it charged for 2 weeks without using it at all after the storm hit and i tried to use it that night the spotlight stayed on for only 20 mins tops before it totally ran out of power luckily the car charger was in the box and the lantern light worked very well on a full charge but i do not give praise to this item at all and i gave it the credit it deserved the 1 star is for the lantern and not the spotlight crappy at best please do not bu	10
0	small print on box charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the ac charger adapter and approximately 12 20 hours using the 12v car adapter the spotlight lantern cannot be used while charging a full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power 30 minutes after charging for 15 hours \? what the heck is the point of this flashlight	10
0	despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes also during those lackluster minutes of operation the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power	10
0	just disappointed is all was n't what i expected and it 's very cheaply made	10
0	i bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure i found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to i'm used to a 60 sec sweep and the minute hand was difficult to read i really had to check to see if i was at 1 5 min or 2 5 min	10
0	i only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places i would say that the ball 's tension would fall under the easy category i 'd recommend the power web over this product	10
0	i found the performance of these michelin tires to be adequate there does n't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well the road seems to have eaten these tires up i have less than 1 000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes that may say something about the quality of roads out here in hawaii i'm getting a flat every time i ride my next tire will be something a little sturdier	10

0	i recieved the arachnid electronic dart board and it looked very cheap the numbers looked like a child put stickers around the board the entire left half of the board would not register that those numbers were hit by the darts i bought a different dart board from walmart that was cheaper and way nicer	10
0	i did get a nice little buzz the first two days i took this product and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out you can push yourself a bit further at the gym the gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product it was n't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it i had no lasting weight loss when taking it just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later i 'd skip it	10
0	nutrex lipo diet pills make me sick to my stomach i never lost any weight at all they just made me sick i would not recomend them to anyone ish	10

0	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !	10
0	they look nice but they 're badly put together i had to re sew all of the fingers within the first month	10

0	i tried to use this thing but it just goes off no matter what even when nothing has moved waste of money	10
0	i had to repurchase this product because my first one broke the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic seriously a design flaw however with some epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better in this case you really get what you pay for its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily i wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times	10
0	stay away from this prodcut manual sucks and the product is horrible there is no way this thing is going to work	10
0	the only satisfaction i have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent if the price seems too cheap it is where to begin \? instructions pretty bad hardware missing inconsistent inadequate design deeply flawed mounting not on my standard mountain bike manufacture cheap cheap cheap what result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work \? i 'll spare you the suspense it did n't not a glimmer	10
0	the velcro belt tore off after the second use ! within a week of purchase ! the material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight	10
0	this product falls into the category of not worth the cost of shipping for me the bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat the bag was shipped in an envelope via usps first class mail for 1 35 samfe was the retailer that amazon used for this transaction so free super saver shipping was not available samfe charged 7 50 for shipping i generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits hence the low star rating for an otherwise adequate product	10
0	we bought 2 of these things they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receiptthe stitching in various parts of the bag came undone we ended up throwing them away i 've been purchasing things on line since 1995 and this product was by far the worst thing we 've ever bought ! ! ! run away run away	10
0	this handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing the adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable do n't risk your safety or your dollars on this product it 's simply not worth the inexpensive price	10
0	i bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy i liked the stroller with air filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel locks however this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car even with my acura i still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk it 's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car 's trunk i was mislead by amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in	10
0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so i thought i might like the alps chair too i was wrong it 's very light weight but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time i used the chair the next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless save your money on this one	10

0	our kids loved this so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on off button \( making the toy unusable \) i bought another one would n't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later \? this toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion the manufacturer needs to correct this problem	10
0	my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed \( this has now happened twice ! ! ! ! ! fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days \( slow leak \) what a waste ! it is so heavy that it would cost 20 to mail it back for a replacement do n't bother	10
0	these seats while they are as nice as they look do not fit into a seat at the stadium rendering them useless ! they take up 1 25 seats per and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them especially if you have 2 they need to make them a few inches smaller	10
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking but after i say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket but still i think the basket is a piece of junk plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable i ca n't recommend this basket buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanksdarealdeal	10
0	the snap on the leapers elite drop leg holster \( the term elite must be used loosely \) would never stay attached it would always either unsnap or come loose at the back eventually it fell off in the field and i lost it the straps would never stay securely in the place i positioned them the leapers deluxe drop leg holster is much more effective even w one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place the method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well spend a few more dollars for the deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the elite	10
0	terrible customer service absolutely the worse do not order from this website i had a bad tape and it would not play they refused to credit my account insinuated that i had a duped copy from somewhere else !	10

0	i purchased a new 26 men 's huffy cranbrook cruiser bike after assembly to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube so what do you do disassemble and return \? no call huffy and they take you through nine hoops finally they sent me the right part which took ten days and i took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me 15 labor to fix the rear wheel no savings ! p s the bike is a piece of junk made in china the instruction manual is nearly useless	10

0	i bought both the ark iii and the super ark the super ark is a slight improvement over the ark iii but i would never recommend people buy either one there are far better entry level kits for just a few dollars more available from other sources the ark iii contains 24 oz of water a food bar and a small inexpensive emergency blanket in a kleenex sized cardboard box i 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits i subsequently purchased i'm surprised and disappointed amazon carries these products	10
0	tent leaks in multiple places including door seam back panel and through seams on rainfly ! this is not normal condensation \( i promise \) but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked the tent was set up according to instructions with rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants \( 2 adults and a three year old \) dry during a rain made for a miserable experience	10
0	i ordered 2 of these flimsy tables they were not only expensive to ship but one arrived damaged the one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully meaning that people 's drinks would slide off the table these are the most flimsy tables i have ever encountered if it were n't for the replacement tables i found at costco the party i planned would have been a disaster	10
0	like other users i found the light output substandard i bought it specifically as an emergency light source if i really needed this light there really would be an emergency ! absolutely pathetic	10
0	i really wanted to like this lantern it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price but the light output is pathetic the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it but i find that doubtful the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon in fact i think you could read a map or a book play cards or follow a trail more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights i'm returning mine	10
0	i bought it given reviews by others but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it has n't worked ever since i 'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works	10
0	it is reasonably accurate the numbers displayed are formed irregularly you ca n't zero it out by zeroing one category i e distance the price is reflective of its quality	10
0	made of a soft steel the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy so it leans forward too much may not accommodate bikes with disk brakes \( the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening \) i had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26 mountain bike	10

0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless a waste of over three hundred dollars	10
0	these skates are very comfortable but within ten minutes the stopper had busted no wonder this item is no longer being sold	10
0	this is a cool gun but has no acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations	10
0	well the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good i dry shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen ! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank ! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games 1 5 out of 5	10
0	well i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking first it went from semi auto to uncontrolled auto then it just stopped working it was pretty cool for a bit and is pretty light and easy to set up but i 'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol	10
0	this would be a great tube except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position unless you 're worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake find another tube	10
0	i bought this to replace a c strobe light i used as a tail light on my bicycle the c strobe was bright flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain and waterproof just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack this one was by the same manufacturer with strobe action and 1 3 the cost it does n't flash the strobe action is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light it is n't anywhere near as bright as the c strobe i'm going to get a c strobe later this month from a local boating dealer	10
0	i was very disappointed with the ironman speed jump rope it is made of cheap plastic and even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end it 's still coiled and kinked it 's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot i would not buy it again even for the low price charged by amazon	10

0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times on the 5th day my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole	10
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me i urge you to buy something else	10

0	i'm sure the mat would have been fine but they mixed up my order and this company does not refund shipping which was almost the price of the mat lame	10
0	when i first got the bike i thought it was great by 2nd ride the chain broke while i was trying to do a simple down shift unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost looking at the metal used it is no wonder it did n't last very poor quality too bad because it is a great looking bike i guess i 'll give wal mart a try next	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
0	i thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope it was n't it was pretty limp for the price i suppose i got what i paid for	10
0	what this is is a cheap skateboard with a cheap metal bar stuck through it with some dora stuff pasted on last minute within the first day of using this the dora sticky paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard \( where your child puts their feet \) was torn within two days it was nearly completely destroyed i tried to fix this with elmer 's glue but to no avail now i have a 'plain' scooter i 've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten spot it might be worth that price but not any more	10
0	nothing against these particular paddles but avoid cheap paddles if you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles if you paddle you will develop a close relationship with your paddles it can either be a good one or a bad one you can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending good paddles will make you want to use your kayak	10
0	to say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement it is basically unuseable ! i wound up throwing it aside the first time i tried it out a complete waste of money	10
0	maybe i should read the description better but i was disapointed to find out when receiving it that this is just a usb key with a pen and anemic led light no swiss army stuff not even a knife i thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have you know a knife \? that said the usb key is very tiny almost too small on its own \( detached from the swiss army non knife housing \) so it 's good it has a home within the casing otherwise it would probably go missing	10

0	i 've been looking for weight lifting gloves and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped these gloves however dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers they also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases these gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases if you want a good pair of gloves do not get these	10
0	it puts out heat but not very well maybe if it was put under a blanket in an emergency it would suffice but by no means is it a replacment for your cars heating system	10
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon amazon was great and sent me new one this one worked for a few days i then had the battery replaced two weeks after it stopped working by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent in short the watch is awful	10
0	after ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart the brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase while ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride with out a seat i had to walk the bike back to the car i advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working	10
0	i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me it is very flimsy it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up my old thighmaster is very sturdy i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year save your money	10
0	the following were the problems 1 bent fender poor packaging2 sratches in paint in several areas3 three nuts were missing4 the front wheel hub had lateral play cannot be fixedplanning to return cycle if amazon accepts it	10
0	the cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and or inept handling by the shipping company a fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched the front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire a required tool a 5mm allen wrench was not provided i have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated however the bike seems to perform adequately as is	10
0	as the previous reviewer said i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper but do n't make a mistake it 's impossible to correct if it is possible i do n't know how as there are no directions using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical with the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made and you probably wo n't even know it just a horrible design and a waste of money	10
0	overall the item works well if keeping track of one player it is just fine when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two	10
0	this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh the poles are not super high quality and i would imagine are going to break is used a lot i used this in some high winds and the zippers broke	10

0	i bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks i tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part no recommendations for proper location then i found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor so now i have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact going to send it bac	10
0	to describe these as light and cheap is exactly right and neither is a compliment my thera band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular \( 3 or 4 times a week \) use the foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges after picking up several chunks of foam off the floor i learned that tying my own handles at the end of the thera band stretch bands works better and is free these handles simply are not sturdy or well made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for save your money	10
0	the foam rubber on my handles is shredding on the edges after only one month not worth the money	10
0	my mom wrecked badly on this the first time out due to the difficult to control steering very awkward handle bars several of us tried to ride it my friend a fitness pro personal trainer put it best by saying that 's the most uncomfortable bike i 've ever ridden mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive i hope somebody likes it	10
0	impossible to get off after a good work out just not for me	10
0	i have had very bad experiences with this company in the past there is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever if there 's a problem in the first 90 days you 're fine after that you 're up the creek and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it as all their components are manufactured in asia they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time be very careful with these people as you 're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty non functioning bookend	10
0	we bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest \( of three \) was a baby i totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe we only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side we used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up and still had this problem maybe an older much more stable child could use it but it is advertised for use with infants and it 's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing	10
0	this boat seemed like a great idea and my 7 month baby does like it it gets him in the water which is fun but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano second he has fallen over the sides he has fallen forward between the seat and tube the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening this boat is dangerous i am looking for a new one	10
0	i bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old he liked the boat well enough even played with it when it was sitting on dry land however in the water this boat is very tippy requiring two adult hands at all times not good if you have more than one kid and need that extra hand i bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer i would n't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat	10
0	small holes unstable no space for the bum my daughter cried everytime we tried it we had a pool school deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared she loved that one i could not find it in the store so i bought the swim school and am regretting it buy the pool school !	10
0	the handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous also the base metal footboard is cracking i would n't spend the money on this scooter it 's not worth it spend your money on a cheaper model razor	10
0	well first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture then when i sent an e mail trying to exchange the product no one returns my calls or e mails me back after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy so yeah if you want a better review contact me so i can exchange the product	10
0	this bed was a real disappointment from the beginning we actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it it 's just a fabric cover perhaps with an extra layer of material but it can't be foam maybe only 1 4 thick at most then after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4 rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally bad bed	10
0	the product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1 2 inch we did n't even bother to blow the thing up utter junk returned for something cheaper and better put together \( we hope \) if i could give this a negative star rating i would	10

0	the day we received the stroller we were very excited we put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction however when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming we have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company i would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time	10
0	i just got mine 3 days ago i can see that it might help toning the areas and the video is not annoying what is a problem is the wonderful bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout i did n't purchase this item for weight loss i thought it would help for toning but the bruises while they may go away with continued use are not worthe the i am sending mine back today sorry	10

0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus ovewrall i cannot recommend this product	10
0	this gun did n't work from the moment my son took it out of the box the return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so i did n't bother it went straight to the trash can	10
0	this gun broke in the first few used when i called for service they inisted on waiting for the tech and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun cost overall this was a writeoff	10
0	okay here 's the bottom line if you 're just getting into airsoft this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot but if you 're actually looking to get into the sport competitively look for a classic army or tokyo marui aug it will be more expensive but it will be quality the number one rule of the airsoft world is you get what you pay for this is a cheap gun and it 's going to perform like a cheap gun if you 're looking for a decent cheap gun let me recommend the utg warhawk utg mp5 or some of the cyma mp5 line	10
0	the gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people would not take it back said he 'd had it too long i will never buy this product nor work with this seller again horrible	10
0	graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product this rack will scrape the paint right off your bike the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords ratchet tie downs etc this was a complete and total waste of money and damaged my bike on top of all that it is not an inexpensive rack ! save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack	10
0	i got this heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so i had to order a replacement strap when i went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week so i had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch i am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better i was very disappointed with this my suunto dive computer is great this hrm sucks	10
0	had to switch bands standard band had patent leather look to it scratched from day one i ca n't understand why a 150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face i 've had 50 nike watches that were scratch proof after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking	10
0	face is made of cheap plastic it scratched within an hour of putting it on watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks i 've been wearing a cheap casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it other problems include the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly for example when i put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat also the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch finally the watch is very well photographed in the ad and does n't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality	10
0	brutal horrible instructions ! no pictures ! no clear concise steps to follow it took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned nothing fits properly it 's very flimsy and unsteady i was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so i returned it do n't waste your time and money spend a little more and get a better product	10
0	i purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy the first time the wind picked up it blew the whole thing apart so for a one time use it is okay the money spent on this was a waste it also looked in places like it had already been repaired \( seconds \) as in 2nd class merchandise	10
0	in less than 3 months the seals did n't work because the velcrow came apart everything inside gets wet poor product	10
0	i never got to use the product upon opening i realized the sizing details on amazon 's website was different than the one on the box i am 5'5 and the 65cm was too big for me although amazon states it 's just my size	10
0	the reason i gave it one star is because of how it affected my body i am an athletic person and very agile but this is one of the workouts that i will never do again i have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and i was in tears i had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it my knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and i could hardly walk i'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain please stay away from the ball workout	10
0	i agree with the previous reviews that say hydrocoach is not accurate instructions say to take deliberate sucks even with that not all ounces register it might only register 12 16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle i like gadgets but this 30 water bottle is not worth it it would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time	10
0	i agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction but took a bad turn somewhere i get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what i 've actually consumed and if you 're really thirsty forget it you 'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst at 30 it 's a hefty price to pay when it 's much simpler to just refill a 20 ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day sorry to say i 'll be returning my hydracoach	10
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item i think it is a good concept but it does n't work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything it is awkward to drink from too i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation	10
0	we found the system very hard to read at night we could n't see it at all to read it our family bought us the better model for xmas so we are going to put this one on ebay would not recommend it	10
0	i bought this compass at a good price thats about all i can say good for this product the backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading i have to keep resetting it i cannot reccommend product	10
0	the attachment is n't textured enough to stay where i put it as i ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand	10
0	you 've got a lot of ab rollers you need a gimmick the product is no better than the competition you do n't have an ad budget what do you do \? charge four times as much then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something	10
0	i bought this seat for 40 on sale at toys r us since it stated it would fit most bikes i followed the directions that came with the seat and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that i tried it on after several choice words and approximately 2 1 2 hours later per bike \( 5 hours total \) i finally had this piece of crap installed only to find out that both my and my wife 's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat do not buy this piece of crap it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne	10
0	i found the size range to be completely missleading my child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs she is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable the bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be	10
0	we bought this for our 2 year old daughter it was a nightmare to put together then it did not fit becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes we bought a 20inch frame men 's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting not worth it ! !	10
0	in my opinion this thing is flimsy and worthless i set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just does n't hold once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin up you realize that you 've already thrown away your money and now it 's time to throw away this product i absolutely agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision	10
0	took it out of the box took 5 minutes to set it up and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall during its first use i definitely would not let children use this item without supervision the bar itself is of good quality but the brackets have to go	10
0	it has n't broken yet but it is going to eventually i'm 5'10 180lbs and these things barely support me and do n't provide a stable grip these would be fine for a smaller woman but thats really it the pvc construction is n't adequate i thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken	10
0	this is the first review that i have done on amazon so far i have purchased over a dozen items on amazon and by and large i have been content happy with all of them except this product this product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled do not buy this product shell out about five bucks more for all metal push up bars	10
0	you cannot sit upright in this chair bad for soccer games \( why we bought it \) the chair is designed to lean back the company is not amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth unless you plan to sleep in this chair it stinks	10
0	if this were an office shredder mon fri support would be ok but hey i have a day job and so i 'd like bowflex to be responsive at my convenience not so	10
0	i got one of these because it was only a penny i used it several times with only a slight crack that i later cemented later i used it again and while cocking it back the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces the gun is fun for about the first few tries then it 's prone to jamming up even though it was only a penny it was 4 99 shipping i'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market i'm not very satisfied but i'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back	10
0	this gun is a very bad gun ! ! ! ! ! if you are from the ages of 6 10 i would get it but if not dont i got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet trust me this gun is a piece of junk just poket to shipping and buy something else ! !	10
0	anything coming out of a box at christmastime is exciting to our toddler most toys though hold an excitement for him this trike lost his interest after one try scuttle the trike i say or let it become unmoved furniture in your home	10
0	i just saw this toy in parents magazine sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at target this week i ran to get it since my son is too short to use his hand me down red tricycle it looked like lots of fun in the picture however my son is too big for it ! i do n't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old no way ! if it were adjustable i'm sure he would have loved it but just like another reviewer stated it 's just like the other ride on toys we already own currently the scuttle bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store how disappointing	10
0	the bottom bolt broke a week after purchase which prevents the unit from functioning as designed it cannot swing out of the way	10
0	this is a nice bag with a fatal flaw the major zippers break very easily after my first bag broke within a few months amazon kindly provided a free replacement deja vu ensued for a few extra dollars delta could use more robust zippers they really should	10
0	this machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled i could n't believe it my advice would be to avoid this product	10
0	this waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof we tried it on two separate occasions both times fully closing each seal but water leaked through anyway soaking the contents when i tried to return the item the seller refused to accept it claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly despite what the company now says the fact is that the item was defective i see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company	10
0	we bought two fannypacks one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip we were doing some shallow water snorkeling no diving my husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports our stuff got soaked ! why our friends worked we and ours did n't is anybody 's guess possibly ours had a defective seal these fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and i know some of them do n't seal right !	10
0	my daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them she learned how to move about on them although a year later she 's still quite wobbly the shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use my problem is that there really is no way for her to stop no knob brake like normal skates have so most of the time she 's pretty out of control or walking like frankenstein also the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own so we have to dot it for her it was n't like that when i first bought it though we bought her normal skates for christmas to replace these	10
0	great use for five minutes then one broke having use kendo shinai bamboo swords before i would not suggest these and only bought them as i had a 25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of	10

0	this thing simply does not work ! i bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and i cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this it cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls i tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if i get better result but no luck	10
0	may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office but not much good as an outdoors job food jar	10
0	i just got the sword and i liked it but i thought that it was a little small then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it ! ! ! ! ! now you might think that i was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wa n't on there very good after that i was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off so do n't buy the sword if you going to do anything but look at it	10
0	i rarely get taken but i did this time one song played 50 times no instructions pad not in tune with tv movements this is going to a garage sale or charity	10
0	this thing is being advertised as dance dance revolution it is not ddr it is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny my daughter plays a ddr at afterschool and loves it she received this for christmas tried it once and gave up within five minutes she said it says fifty songs but it plays just one well the 50 songs all sound the same they are not radio or stereo quality rather just computer generated noise totally awful having tried it myself i am very disappointed and do n't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance total waste of money and total false advertising this company should be investigated believe the poor reviews and skip this product ! ! ! !	10
0	i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game this has nothing to do with the real dance dance revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name which is not on the actual product very disappointed !	10
0	my husband bought me this for christmas and we were both disappointed the graphics are awful some give me a headache the songs are awful they all sound alike its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard the pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly i 've had it two weeks and already i'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss i gave it two stars because my kids \( ages 6 and 2 \) love it but then again they do n't know any better i am using it to get better at ddr but then i will invest in a better pad and game	10
0	before buying ddr i read everyone 's reviews and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it this product really fools you this is why if you 've seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like well the dance pad and the box looks normal untill you turn it on ! it says 50 songs right \? well it 's not really 50 different songs about 20 25 of these songs are a trick they combine 2 songs and make it into one track the graphics are horrible a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are i would n't reccommend buying this at all	10
0	the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly i could barely assemble it together because it would not fit maybe they sent me wrong disks i do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase it does not work as well as i expected also gofit web page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it waste of money i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works	10
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer	10
0	i just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when i unrolled it chinks of the mat came off very poor quality and i'm unsaitsfied i would not recommend getting this mat	10

0	only about one third of the decks do not have ink makings on the backs wich makes them completely unusable	10
0	i just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today i brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews when i read that people are losing this thing all the time i could believe it ! loli 'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it	10
0	i am not very happy with my new pedometer it falls off all the time the face plate comes off and i have a very hard time making it stay back on the spring has now broke from the clip so the pedometer wo n't even clip to my pants anymore i have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that i am disappointed with this purchase	10
0	i bought 2 one fell off my belt and i lost it the other does not work at all it works even if if i shake it and the insides hit the cover from inside maybe its broke already i dont recommend anyone to buy it just walk rather than buy such gizmos that is the pilosophy i learnt from this episode	10

0	the bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery i returned the item for a refund	10
0	these gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they 're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand in addition the padding is very thin i would n't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer they 're probably fine for the speed bag if you 're going to use these gloves at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or like me you 'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles for not very much more money you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection	10
0	i was extremely disappointed when i received this product contrary to the description the handles are hard plastic not comfortable and soft as it states on the product packaging and website other than that it may be a decent product but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin i 've already printed the label to return to amazon beware the other review of this product the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on amazon not only is it not informative there is a good chance they have never tried the product	10
0	these really suck i shot my lil brother in the head point blank it didnt hurt i was holding him as a hostage beacuase we play that way his teamate stuck a m16 macine gun to my head i told him to back off or ill shoot i shot and the damn bb did not come out i got a big welt on my head for 5 days and got in big troble beacuse i was trying to shot the brat	10

0	when i received the shipment i was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes when i placed the order no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes otherwise i would have ordered kickboards in 'blue' color the yellow and purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife	10
0	i was going to give this product a 3 because the trays acutally quite nice just as the previous reviewer i love handing out chips in them however i re read the name of the product and i had to change my vote to a 1 these chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating not only during game play but afterward when i'm trying to store them	10
0	i bought this band in two strengths it is advertised as 99 998 free of soluble proteins and latex allergens and powder free and it is neither i used them and got a skin reaction to latex which i would not have if it was only 02 latex customer service was helpful when i called	10
0	this was a very disappointing product amazon delivered it in great time but razor is very misleading about the quality of this product it is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it it is frustrating to be told by the razor customer service after the purchase that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood there goes the portability of it ! very disappointing !	10
0	these are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on television the cardio video is entirely too fast i teach aerobics twice a day and it 's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner could n't keep up also the music is really boring i use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd	10
0	the first time i did this video i was in pain for three days each time i exercised to this video it got easier but i do n't have fun i have nowhere to put the fanny lifter steps that i did n't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table if i could do it over i would n't buy this product however you will get an excellent workout if you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video \( there is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video	10
0	this sounds very stupid i'm sure but i ca n't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery i unscrew it with a coin as i'm told but when i ca n't turn it with the coin anymore i still ca n't get the darn thing open	10

0	the area around the velcro has already started to fray this was a christmas gift so she has not had them long i think that the quality should be better the knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well	10
0	the front wheels came off the first day christmas day ! very frustrating !	10
0	i will never purchase an item from babyride again this canopy is misleading it said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net the sun came right through and blinded my baby not only that it is not worth the price ! ! you could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for 5 also when i went to return the item they charged me a restocking fee which i had never heard of ! ! ! bad item i ordered the rayshade by kiddopotamus and loved it get this one instead !	10
0	i can do this without the system it 's simple why do n't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything	10
0	i also bought this because it was the consumer reports best buy and i expected to get a lot of use out of it the frame broke on my first \( i weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week \) after about 1100 miles and its replacement just died after only 350 miles so far i 've paid about a dollar a mile i 'll never buy from schwinn again	10
0	this ab wheel is simple to use however i have n't had the same results as the other reviewers the only place i have felt the workout is in my arms for a good ab workout i would recommend buying an ab dolly or the video 8 minute abs	10
0	this product is not fit for use in any circumstance it definately looks great but thats it ! the product \( ca n't call it a gun \) broke in the first 5 hours of use not combat play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters i am extremely dissapointed with the quality of the product i wrote two letters to the seller manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet not surprised my son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it was well worth it we did not repeat buy and wo n't learn from our mistake	10
0	i wish i 'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it i had the same problem many other reviewers here had after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks the cable snapped rendering it useless this is just a poor quality machine plain and simple	10
0	i wish the review written in january was posted before i bought this thing i bought this as a present and the exact thing happened the cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use the ad states it holds 250lbs but when you get it the item states 220 which she was still below that but the cable snapped anyway stay away from this item far far away	10
0	this was given to me as a gift i used it almost every day for about 1 1 2 months then a cable on it broke it never even worked that well to begin with i e mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come they gave no apologies they could not have cared less eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame	10

0	i car camp around 6 weeks a year every night on a different spot i was looking for a light and sturdy table easy to setup and easy to pack this table is not the right table for me yes it 's light that 's the only good atribute i can find for this table it 's cumbersome to setup the plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile the end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled it 's low to the ground i would not buy this table again nor i would recommend anyone to buy it i give it one star because i ca n't give it any lower alvarosacramento ca	10
0	the set up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load but when used in a 2 in hitch it wobbles like crazy ! i was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn i had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right but it 's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch	10
0	i bought this for my 43 lb 6 year old daughter for christmas the back fender main body headlights and the rims are made of cheap plastic this toy was broken on the first day she rode it the back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless	10
0	our daughter got one of these for christmas she 's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel \( which is make out of plastic \) broke i regret paying what i did for this one not because of what the going price is now but because it 's a piece of junk do not buy this piece of crap	10
0	i ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations but i expected it to project sound at least a short distance when we tried it out all we got was feedback words were not audible at all when i contacted the seller i was told it was a novelty item only which i think is a ridiculous answer since even a novelty item should work a little maybe the one we got was broken i did n't try again since the seller did n't seem to think anything was wrong with it when i called and the shipping which was not refunded when i returned it was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	10
0	this item sounded great in the ad but the only thing right in the ad is that it 's pocket sized no one can understand what i say through it when the volume is turned up the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent i thought this would be a great device but no one can understand me 10 feet away much less 200 if you order this device save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund warning the shipping is non refundable	10
0	this was a bitter disappointment one of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control however if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting we get horrific feedback \( screeching \) nothing seems to help and when i sent a note to the manufacturer for advice i never received an answer unfortunately i 'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem so it looks like it 'll hit the trash save your money and do n't purchase this item	10
0	this bench is a bit of a joke unfortunately having put the bench together myself i can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on it 's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two very small pieces of metal balanced over the main structure i feel foolish for buying this bench between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a maximum total weight of 300lbs including you and the weight you're lifting i think it would be a mistake to purchase this the maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet it 's narrow and small	10
0	this bench went together quickly all the parts fit well and the instructions were decent anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems there are a few steps where a second set of hands help craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent however this bench is simply not built for much weight it will wobble and flex it does n't feel safe at all if you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench there are alot better benches out there for just a little more money	10
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me i urge you to buy something else	10
0	this product is actually quite small even though is says mini i still expected it to be a little bit bigger also it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it the seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone	10
0	this will work only if you are doing work outs while you are not doing work outs if you wear this i do n't think it would be of any help	10
0	this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo	10
0	it does what its supposed to do but its made for someone 5'6 i'm 6' and not really enjoying it	10
0	granted this was on sale for 20 bucks it was originall 75 it 's poorly made difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use	10
0	the ab roller was a big disappointment for me it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts then once that project was done i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me as a very petite \( 4'11 \) woman my hands barely reached the top bar making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly so beware shorties out there	10
0	received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly 5 days after emailing the company they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and i must return it to them before they will send out a new box very frustrating i must drive 20 miles to the nearest ups store to return it wish i had just bought the thing at walmart	10
0	this pump did not work very well for me must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help i wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead	10
0	did n't pump any air into the tire the first 2 stomps tried it again another day 3rd stomp and the gauge went flying off put the gauge back on and it still does n't work biggest waste of money never even filled one tir	10
0	when i first time used it it's borken and i can not return or exchange without bo	10
0	i wanted to use this pump to pump my bike but it never worked it leaked it can only used to pump up balls only it is a piece of junk	10
0	i bought this pump and used it on three bikes a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent then broke if you need a pump i suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one i tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson bell products are cheaply made and do n't last beyond a few uses do n't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a sunday when there 's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air stay away from this and other pedestrian pumps makes you wonder what a bell helmet will look like after a spill	10
0	it only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs does n't run well over pine needles or leaves \( make sure to rake the yard before riding ! \) the acceleration in slow the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens i spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing it stops when the child tries to make a tight turn all of this was on the grass it was advertised as being rugged off road capable when in fact it only works on the paved driveway do n't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person it 's been 3 days and still have n't heard !	10
0	you can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride because of the adapter it only charges while its on the machine there is no seperate battery charger	10
0	the only reason i am rating this stroller a 1 is amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds it actually is only 50 pounds it is now being returned	10
0	i was very dissastisfied with the product the 16 inch dora bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter we had to keep it in the box until christmas eve so that she would n't find it when i started assembling it that night we found no training wheels or seat i was very upset for obvious reasons how do you tell a 4 yr old that santa forgot the seat and training wheels for her bike	10
0	these goggles suck i swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them but they fog up in 5 minutes fit terribly are hard to adjust and cause irritation around my eyes they leak water and the different nose pieces are just a joke they go from tiny a little bigger than tiny huge and then extra huge they do n't fit ! what a waste of 15 i 've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store they are only 5 and they fog up and leak the same as these	10
0	i love the idea of this sleek out of the way for transit butreadily available on the road protected when not in use unfortunately the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety because of the narrowness of the mirror it 's very difficult to focus on whatis actually behind you with a quick glance sure if you sit there for 10seconds you can figure it out but i do n't have that sort of time when i'mdodging through chicago traffic ! save your money and buy the excellent mirrcycle instead	10
0	even though they look pretty cool these mirrors are hard to focus and even harder to see anything in	10
0	uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors as mentioned the mirrors are of a terrible quality to top that they do not stay in place when adjusted	10
0	mirrors are too small and too distorted the picture on the package shows a perfect reflection as if ! ! it 's about as useful as taping two foil wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them	10
0	be sure you have a very flat smooth surface for these bumper cars there is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car our girls rode them in our driveway sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway we had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface these are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court	10
0	not what i expected this bench is ok for a petite woman not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall	10
0	both the original order and the attempted re order were missing the same parts \( the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope \) when the item arrived i think that this is a design flaw in the packaging	10
0	when i ordered the product i kept putting on my order for a medium size when the final paperwork was sent for delivery it said it was being shipped and it was a small a small was sent instead of a med thereforewe could not use the product if you can take care of this matter with a return ticket for the small one we would appreciate it	10
0	first off the knife is great i would n't expect anything less from swiss army only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 and since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it i give the knife a two only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well	10
0	this machine is too easy even with the additional resistance bands it 's just not enough if you 're an active person at all the assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine i used it every day for a month \( until i felt i 'd gotten my money 's worth \) now it collects dust i 'd sell it for 20 at this point just to get it out of my house i see my easy shaper becoming a goodwill donation in the very near future	10
0	this gun is not good it is a piece of crud beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks get it if your a idiot i wish i could give it 0 star	10
0	the set is fine however the crate was completely busted up i will think twice before i order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all i was going to try and get a refund but i am not going to pay to have it returned however if the powers that be might receive this e mail a new crate or bag would be wonderful an amazon patron iri	10
0	plastic junk tried it once wont try again just get a piece of rope and cut it to size this thing is suppose to be adjustable only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle the plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks leading you to trip over it just get a piece of rope	10
0	we bought and then returned the scuttle bug it was well made and easy to snap together however it was far far too small for our 27 months old daughter who happens to be very petite \( only 25 percentile for height and weight \) her knees dragged the ground i think it is a cool product but maybe for younger smaller children we wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic ! !	10
0	make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer it does n't work with every bike it did n't with mine i called allegro medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying i cant return it unless it is defective so now i have a bike trailer and a bike that do n't work together and i'm out 85 00 horrible	10
0	this bike trailer seemed like a great deal when i assembled it and tested it out it worked great seemed very safe and comfortable my daughter loved riding in it initially i was very happy with the product especially for the price paid unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps used for support and restraints began detoriating and breaking i would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials	10
0	rec 'd this pitchback and assembled the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults very disappointed	10
0	received the order in a timely fashion however the box was badly i mean badly damaged it was a birthday gift for a family member i always order early mistake returns are 30 days we had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off white carpeting to make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me happy birthday ! ! ! ! ! ! and your welcome for the carpet stain all new things come rusty you did n't know that	10
0	the table is easy to put together but it is uncomfortable on your feet to use	10
0	this stand deserves a 0 but that wasnt an option the engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked it is of poor design and quality i wouldnt take if they were givin it away i 've had it set up in my basement for a few days and i couldnt wait to take it down and return which i did pronto do yourself a favor stay away	10
0	this stand is very bad quality not worth investing in this stand the speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood it vibrates too much ! the swivel it comes with is made out of plastic ! it sucks ! invest in a better stand like the ones from www balazsboxing co	10
0	i was thrilled when i received this knife it was cute small and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom emergency situations however after less than a month in my purse the floral plastic cover \( which in truth i thought felt pretty flimsy when i got it \) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other sigh	10
0	this item is horrible ! it is flimsy and did n't even come with any instructions even though it was so cheap i feel so ripped of	10
0	the stamper broke on the very 1st ball i tried to personalize ! a little black washer fell out of mechanism and the stamp jammed and would not stamp the golf ball	10
0	shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product ! it is garbage a waste of time and money	10
0	this item is a piece of junk all you get is smudges and black marks it does not work buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper just please do n't buy this thing	10
0	do n't buy this it does n't work the ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp i 've attempted around 50 stamps \( on some range balls \) and not one is crisp and clear the stamp is either running \( too much ink \) or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink save your money buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that	10
0	my daughter loves it you wants to practice more often now thank	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10
0	the design of the bed is awesome unfortunately it would not hold air there were no visible flaws the instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used the bed would not hold air at all \( i only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st \) i purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing i love the design but i am disappointed in the quality	10
0	this mattress has deflated on my guests since the first time i used it very aggravating because it 's a pain in the you know what to send something this large heavy bulky back	10
0	this was a big waste of money the first day of use my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night i thought maybe it was because two people were on it a couple of monthe later i had another guest sleep on it he had to do the same thing ihe ended up sleeping on the couch he thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway again do not waste your money ! !	10
0	the pillow top portion of the bed started leaking after few times of use	10
0	bed is not even after few hours of sleep very difficult if two people are sharing the bed when one rolls in the sleep other person wakes worse still you will get up with back pain shoulder pain even if you manage to sleep	10
0	unfortunately this product did not live up to our expectations it did not last one full season the bottom braces not reinforced very well	10
0	i did n't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly is n't designed well the target that hangs inside the cage does n't actually fit and the netting does n't stop the balls how 's that for a good product 1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net buy anything else	10
0	difficult to set up ! netting rips far too easily avoid this item ! be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough	10
0	the thing broke ! ! ! i never thought i 'd see a chain breaker tool that would break under the stress of taking apart a chain ! ! and the worst part is i only used the thing about five times	10
0	stay away from this chain breaker i hoped for a few uses of this breaker but instead got only half way through my first job before the handle broke and threads started to cross thread my nashbar one was much better quality and only slightly more expensive	10
0	placed the order on 11 20 delivery was supposed to be by 12 9 on about 12 1 i contacted the company that amazon said was the provider unbeatable sale inc to verify that they did have the order unbeatable said that it was an amazon order period and gave me a number at amazon to contact amazon said that unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at walmart	10
0	before purchasing this watch you should go to a store and take a look this watch is huge the temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch then because of your body temp you have no idea what the temp is the barometer feature is displayed in millibars not something i am acquainted with i could not get the compass feature to work correctly it took approx 3 weeks to be delivered \( free shipping \) i returned the watch and purchased a timex paid for shipping and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly	10
0	these stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands i would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks	10
0	do n't order this item or anything from mercantilla inc the product was a different color than advertised it was missing three important parts without which you ca n't use the bench and many of the other parts were damaged i 've never had this many problems from any of amazon 's sellers this was supposed to be my holiday present but it turned out to be a real disappointment	10
0	since i have received this piece of s t i have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working you have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message	10
0	i used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely amazon sent a free replacement it did the same thing i could n't get it to turn on then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on i could n't get it to turn off it needs major redesigning i like the concept and it was comfortable but that 's about all barbara baxte	10
0	i had great hope for this item after reading reviews but found that it did n't function as described and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually and i have tiny hands it 's a great idea but needs a re design before i could use it	10
0	when the grill arrived my husband put it together right away i am glad he did it was very unstable i would be afraid of cooking anything on it we packaged it back up and sent it right back	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
0	basically i ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks ! that was really long especially because i upgraded my shippping i dont' like this because the grip is n't really grippy \( lol \) and the strings make your hands hurt because they 're kinda loose the only thing i like about this is that it donates to breast cancer but i really do n't recommend this raquet i bought an n code right after i tried to use this 3 times very unsatisfied this wilson does n't live up to the wilson reputation for m	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10
0	i went to swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others this is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand but i found that the suggested retail is 4 lower to what amazon is selling it for just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price even though amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap probably too cheap to be any good	10
0	when one trips the safety key one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again this action looses all the time and distance information the keys fitness who manufactures ironman and a bunch of others help line confirmed that this is normal for their products i see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body	10
0	i was so happy to order this it has n't even been put together yet in box for two weeks they sent the wrong hardware with it i emailed them 2 times and got no response after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice she was nice and shipped the parts they arrived today and guess what \? the same wrong parts again i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together at least i have a list from the owner 's manual overall experience was a big fat bust	10
0	this stepper is terrible ! the bar between the steps cracked after only two months of regular use in addition it is very squeaky and the monitor does n't register anything unless you step all the way to the ground do n't waste your money on this piece of junk	10
0	this sounds great in theory being that you do n't have to get under the car to drain the oil fantastic ! but while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars i do n't quite agree you still have to get under the car to change the oil filter so i 'd suggest saving 50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car which is actually faster than using this device	10
0	poor workmanship padded handgrip area varied from 3 25 to 3 5 long most palms are wider than that the cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use shipping them back would cost more than they 're worth	10
0		10
0	one of the worst ! the braces that secure the material and the tent together broke ! after taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods when i went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped it sits on our from curb for garbage as i write this review	10
0	this mat may have a design flow or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll in the process the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat i suppose it 's still functional but my brand new mat looks pretty awful	10
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer	10
0	i just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when i unrolled it chinks of the mat came off very poor quality and i'm unsaitsfied i would not recommend getting this mat	10
0	great feedbacks from j leigh this sword is for display only try swinging it around and you 'll see what happens they should add that to the description	10
0	this is not a usable sword this is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall there are very few swords that can be used among these are paul chen 's cold steel 's and the last legend stuff only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade	10
0	first of al it is not stainless steel it has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap handle is not that reliable it is like it 's gonna break easily i mean do n't think of any usage it is only for decoration	10
0	i bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy severly lacking speed i also bought the stiga champion which is lighter and faster i would spend 6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it	10
0	these are not 100 plastic but they are paper please do not buy these if you think you are getting plastic cards	10
0	do n't buy these cards they are of very low quality i bought 4 decks several cards in each deck where visibly marked you will be better off paying a few dollars more for high quality cards	10
0	first off the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel ! !	10
0	the padding is too bulky toward the knuckels there is no padding on the fingers the gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves	10
0	the thule load bars that i actually received were only 50 inches long and i needed the 58 inch load bars so i really could n't do anything with them it specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars but they were not i even wrote amazon back to try and right the situation but no one contacted me so i had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length	10
0	i 'll be returning right away suction cup does not hold at all completely useless	10
0	this weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion you would have to be a little kid for it to work after working along time to put it together i found neither me nor my 6'2 kid could use it effectively	10
0	this fitness mat is thick and cushy but i find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it 's about a foot too short my biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover \( a major reason i selected this product \) shrank to a completely unusable size when i washed it \( in cold water line dried \) now i'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable	10
0	i was just looking at tennis rackets on the amazon site the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one i did not press to conferm this order but amazon kept my credit card details on record and used them nicola bradle	10
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box the product was scratched and parts were broken fortunately the bench works but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage the product seems to be of quality it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap	10
0	keeps the drinks chilled but not coldwhat do you expect for 20buckswould no buy again would go for the more traditional fridges	10
0	it 's not that bad of a product considering how cheap it is however i have three definite criticisms one it is n't very stable when your doing dips it 's pretty wobbly two the pull up bar is n't far enough away from the crossbars so if your body swings at all during your pull ups it 's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar and three the push up bars are totally usless you can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar	10
0	at first they kept the water out of my eyes and werecomfortable but after 3 or 4 times they had some waterleakage i use them for recreational swimming at theymca but am already looking for another swim goggle i hope you post this even though i gave them a poor rating thank you eileen	10
0	usually puzzle mats come in 6 pieces you can visit walmart and they have same type ther	10

0	i ordered several of these tables as christmas presents two of five arrived broken both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs the tops are made out of a brittle plastic spend more money and order a table with a metal top	10
0	these provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating however i 've had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart i am not sure how long they will last i purchased these to replace a similar set i had for 9 years which were worn but not falling apart now i wish i had not thown the old ones away	10
0	i never received the product and had a terrible experience with amazon trying to get my money back	10
0	the product that was delivered was defective the harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing i contacted lafuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem they sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid april when the new model comes out the manufacturer was responsive however i was out of pocket 13 00 for a shipping box that i purchased for the mailing in fairness amazon should reimburse me for this 13 00 expense i did not expect to receive a defective product	10
0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar the old 724 had metal connectors making them plastic is insane these connectors will break over time additionally a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors	10
0	it was flat after one night of sleeping we had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning also be aware that you need an ac outlet to pump it up it 's not for camping	10
0	i bought one outside amazon and charged it 15 hours my mini maglite had more power the battery never worked do n't waste your money better pay a little more but for something that works	10
0	easy to use in the configurations shown however 3 million candlepower does n't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 20 minutes of use	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10
0	i loved it the first 2 months i had it with out notice the cable shredded i called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me it seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it the customer service is bad and so was the product	10
0	the band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use i did n't even had the chance to kick with it i excepted better quality from everlast too badin addition the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin	10
0	although the pack looks ok at first glance a seam at the top ripped the first time i used it i'm returning it	10
0	no risistence at all ! ! u might must swing your arms n legs in air	10
0	i read the reviews below and then went into the sharper image to test the product myself there is no resistance what so ever and i simply cannot immage getting a good workout from this product	10
0	i have a small head and this was way too tight for me it pulled my hair and left me with a headache plus it has a strong chemical smell that did n't go away after wearing in the pool i tried it 3 times thinking it might get better but gave up and threw away spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead	10
0	the important top hand bar is missing the thing smells like gear grease i ca n't tell if i like to use is because it 's missing parts	10
0	after unpacking and assembling the ab chair deluxe i noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold the digital read out display lite up all 8 's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit i still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective get a ab chair just not this one	10
0	ab lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna belt \( import junk \) direction manual is almost useless does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used you will need to look at tv commercials and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together their web site is no help	10
0	only heats the palm of your hand fingers stay cold no elements in the fingers of the glove only heating element is in the palm of your hand not worth the money	10
0	your money could be well spent on something other than this not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal mart	10
0	i would n't recommend this table some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken and i 've only used this table on three camping trips too bad because most of my other coleman gear has held up really well	10
0	this bagpack is ridiculously small believe me it cannot even fit 1 college book the description did not say that it is for elementary school kids believe me this bag is for elementary school kids yes ! ! ! it is that small i'm gave it as a present to my friends cousin who goes to the elementary school i am not kidding the photo is misleading it is unbelievably small if you buy you 'll see	10
0	the dimensions of this bookbag where not stated the bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts i had to pay double shipping sending it back a big disappointment	10
0	three days after i put this on my keyring the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together then a week later the compass popped out of the case it 's now in my tool drawer perhaps only mine was this fragile	10
0	i cant say anything for the other things but the compass does not work at all north is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same north does does not i was looking for a simple compass keychain this is small and a keychain but a compass that works it is not	10
0	i enjoy the elliptical i really do especially when i first received the box it had no instruction manual ! ! ! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together !	10
0	no where does amazon say in their description that this comes completely disassembled ! i have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer so here it sits in it 's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor amazon is not paying for return shipping and i can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy this may be a good machine but i will never find out	10
0	this is completely junk do n't buy it it colapsed in a 5 mph wind \( with out the sides attached \)	10
0	when the scope arrived it came slightly cracked on the end you look through which was n't a good start then when i looked through there was no magnification just small red crosshairs if you are looking for a functioning scope do not buy this scope but if ur looking to decorate your gun then this looks pretty cool on it	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
0	i just came accross this ad and thought to say something about the price of this item please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price	10
0	bought this machine based on the reviews on amazon it was okay at first i workout regularly with tapes outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week by the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain we tried to see if we can fix it but it did n't work i ca n't use it anymore mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere you get what you paid for ! ! ! now i'm looking to invest in something more sturdy if you exercise once every month this is the machine for you !	10
0	well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine i am totaly disappointed with this machine	10
0	even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product \( as described \) i still would have returned the item the mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it was n't really suitable for the intended purpose	10
0	i bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning i had to order another inner tube then on the third day of trying to use this stroller the front wheel completely bent what a piece of garbage i only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all i was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb the other thing i did n't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang put a diaper bag i sent this stroller back and bought a maclaren double stroller	10
0	i have used a few different brands of stevia liquid this is defiantly a sub par version as evidenced by the additions of glycerin and water in the product i would recommend using a different brand that has neither	10
0	the suggested 1 to 2 drops does n't sweeten and more makes coffee bitter	10
0	i bought this ear plugs are uncomfortable my ears hurt and in the first use just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc are better	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
0	beware ! ! ! these balls are extremely hard they are like hitting bricks i bought them because of the name penn i bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of penn pressureless balls after 30 minutes of play they broke my racket my hand hurt and my arm hurt i am now trying to return these bricks i mean balls to swingsomewhere i 'll let you know how it goes	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	and buy a gps instead i agree with previous reviewer \( dave57 \) i would never buy a suunto again worst than dave i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water could n't even tell the time i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and kindly offered a repair for 140 euros	10
0	a hammock hanging kit is a piece of rope ! doh	10
0	like most weight loss product these were a wate of money on the plus side they did a fair job a suppressing my appitite but i did not lose even an ounce no side effects either no head aches or shakes	10
0	i bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting although well built it is poorly designed the place where the hit a way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs the cables on the hit a way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit you might get one or two hits in before it is unusable a giant waste of money the only reason i give it 2 stars is the construction is solid	10
0	the shipping for this product cost more than the product itself it was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope	10
0	the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want the clips breaks off easily the pedometer just stops working mine stopped working after 1 month i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks do n't bother buying cause it wo n't last long enough to be worth it	10
0	i emailed skycaddie contact us the day after i bought a sg4 to ask for help i have received no response in 3 weeks i played today with it for the first time a guy i was playing with today also had a sg4 neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong gps signal all we got was 999 or complete blanks he has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and did n't work twice it looks great on tv it is a real pity that my unit did n't work today i plan on returning it this week	10
0	all this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres i ca n't think of anything else i have ever bought that was as completely useless as this it is a toy pretending to be an air pump the nonfunctional lever on the top \( mentioned by other reviewers \) indicates that it was designed as a toy i'm just happy i was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway not out on a trail in the past i have bought a number of bell products including motorcycle helmets i now shudder to think what might have happened if i had put one of them to the test	10
0	this pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls but there 's no way to attach it securely to the pump ! the instructions are completely useless does not deserve the one star	10
0	it is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market this pump is 100 junk so bad that i am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump the instructions were a disaster and why would i need to look at instructions for a pump \? well that is because it does not work and i mean does not work at all ! the lever on the side is a total gimmick \( does nothing as the previous review states \) save your money here do not buy this pump	10
0	i carried this pump on my bike because is small light and looks good but when i had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway this is one of several bell products i 've been dissatisfied with	10
0	i got this because it was cheap but since it does n't work and i have to get another i did n't really save any money the lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing it 's completely fake nothing inside moves when you move it and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve it 's just something you can play with while you 're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you i did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire with a flat tire i could n't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in	10
0	the gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter	10
0	scary looking but inpractical the wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already \( if your fists are that big you do n't need claws \) the talon shaped blades are sharp but ca n't dig in they can only scratch they even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard nice wall decor but nothing more	10
0	i bought this watch because i wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size it is huge looked like i had a clock on my wrist take into consideration	10
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 usually ships in 24 hours it actually took 1 week to ship it 2 when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have leather band the band was made of artificial materials \( nylon and rubber \) or something like that i will have to return it	10
0	it 's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up but what was worse was that after i owned it for two weeks the thing stopped working ! it was never dropped or damaged in anyway it just stopped the display just faded away and would n't work again even with a new battery this one was such a waste of money i 'll definately buy a different brand next time	10
0	i walk pretty much the same distance daily and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route i could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride etc but off by thousands of steps \? hardly worth it	10
0	initially a very good buy however after only 3 days of very light use i had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk and i was in another room for the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case	10
0	well all i can say is do n't buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	the gloves looked great online but in actually the quality of the product was not what i imagined the gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm instead it had a thin sheet of nylon the closure was not secure enough so i was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on on the bright side the gloves were pretty and i had no problems returning the product back to amazon com	10
0	the leather pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing i used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring i would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings	10
0	i ordered it for christmas but i did n't get it until december 27th it 's now in a closet waiting for another gift giving occassion	10
0	i regret buying this gun it broke within four days of buying it we did just enough shooting to adjust the hop up \( for accuracy \) and it fired great it was really accurate the gun was made of really cheap plastic and the trigger stopped working right now we 're waiting for a rma on it i would recommend paying a little extra to buy a more durable gun i bought another gun that cost 55 and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable	10
0	the specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation well if there any i sure could n't find them not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment the bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time i'm very sorry that i purchased this bag	10
0	this is a useless product i do not exercise much and i do not even get a burn from this machine the dvd is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone it looks like it is low budget !	10
0	unfortunately i purchased this product thermometer and compass are not at all working thermometer always shows 65 f and compass allways shows err i highly recommend not to buy this on	10
0	bought mine sometime around christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to st thomas last week it died within 10 minutes of being in the water it was never more than 5' down while i was snorkeling while i never tested the compass or thermometer against known accurate ones it seemed to work well enough for my purposes just keep it dry	10
0	overall not terribly happy with this units user interface and design the spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as sw1 sw2 etc but they are not labeled as such on the device you toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are \( tr ch what \? \? \) just an unfreindly interface all around look for a better unit	10
0	do n't buy this compass if you need to know any direction if you know about where the sun sets you will be more accurate than this compass it is impossible to use in the field a waste of money inaccurate to the max impossible to maintain it level etc just junk they should give them away	10
0	had to return the first one due to non functioning thermo and fault compass small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts	10
0	one of the handles would not go in the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when i would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction they told me to send it back for a replacement and i'm still waiting and waiting ! ! ! so i would rate this unit a 0 how do i get my monies back \? \? \?	10
0	i bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun i go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it i know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up	10
0	i purchased these teva 's for kayaking these are the most uncomfortable sandals i have ever worn they are even painful while sitting in a boat i do not recommend them	10
0	the only thing on this that works well is the watch the altimeter thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least	10
0	as others have mentioned already i found this thing to be very very wobbly i never ever felt comfortable riding with my \( almost 4 year old \) son on this thing it just felt too unstable i returned this after only a few days	10
0	i bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when i rode on vacation when i assembled the trailer the chain was twisted i bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel the sprocket was badly bent i bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel by the time i got it all working my vacation was over by the time i see my granddaughter again she 'll have her own bike i'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to	10
0	i rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid 's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child 's bike straight but i never recived the part i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they did n't help me i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs thank you	10
0	just to warn you this product does not come with a usb cable and it does n't work with most laptops i have had you need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all the ecaddy is great but the caddylink is next to worthless	10
0	i ordered this item and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise	10
0	front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way i replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup the gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth i did n't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there would n't be other expenses down the road to deal with so i decided to return the bike and buy something local i can get a look at before we buy	10
0	i ordered this item thinking it was a pair when i received it and realized my error i ordered another of the exact same item when i got it i found that it was half an inch wider than the first a different shade of color and the pile seemed thinner and flattened now i'm ordering a pair from a different company hopefully the higher price indicates better quality	10
0	i bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use making them completely unusable	10
0	i measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup	10
0	i try to use this but do n't work good ! ! the best option is play in a court	10
0	this is not what i expected it to be at all ! it did not come with a pole and it did not improve my skills if at all it made my wrist hurt more	10
0	the advertising was not clear as to what your getting it does not include the stand for the ball assembly	10
0	i tried this on the day i got it to see how it felt the velcro is so strong that when i tried to take it off the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off i would not advise buying this i was dissappointed in the quality of this product	10
0	the best ever ! ! ! if you do n't have on buy one but buy the bag	10
0	like you \( i'm sure \) i saw this machine on television \( mistake number one \) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first this machine is a joke if you cannot get your legs over your head then maybe this machine is for you but this is not for serious users who stretch everyday i can do more with my 5 stretch band from target than i can with this big heavy space taking piece of junk the resistance is zero and just laughable over all save yourself the money and frustration buy a lightweight no hassle stretch band !	10
0	its light was okay although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book the main problem is it 's too shabby to survive a battery change so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out also finding 3v lithium batteries is not easy	10
0	not amazon 's fault but everlast 's even the box promises 2 10 pound weights but it is in fact a 10 pound set of 2 5 pound weights this is not a bargain but fairly expensive quality is just ok not flimsy or dangerous but not what i wanted either	10
0	the description doesnt mention it but the weights are sand filled bags when using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable	10
0	i got this because it was cheap at k mart and thank goodness i can return it the ball is really small i love how they omit the size from all of their information i did n't pump it up with the pump so i do n't know how good that is \( i used an air compressor \) the other equipment is n't too bad but i was really getting this for the ball which just so happens to be a piece of poopola i would n't suggest getting this	10
0	i had a different experience than the other reviewer i would also consider myself a beginner golfer but the medicus has not worked for me it might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time but if you are trying to improve your swing it does n't help you develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge but it is still a bad swing i heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it but not good for beginners	10
0	this pedometer is so cheap it is n't worth the 1 88 pricetag unless you want to cheat yourself this is not the pedomter for you you gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants then walking to my co workers desk five steps from mine i gained about 30 steps by the end of my work day i had apparently walked 11 953 steps that i mostly acquired turning in my office chair and i wo n't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car on top of all this the company would n't refund me on the pedometers i ordered for my co workers	10
0	this pedometer is not very reliable it is very inaccurate in its count it counts a step at the littlest movement i put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260 just moving it to look at it recorded more steps if you want something really accurate spend more money	10
0	i am the captain of a walking team and i purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members i wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it on the very first day the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions and by the end of the day one of the buttons had fallen off i do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers i should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money	10
0	i brought this pedometers for my church s walking program and we are not happy with them my pedometer keeps falling off with a leach also the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero if i had to buy over again i would not buy this pedometer	10
0	more of a novelty than a useful flashlight need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times would not recommend buying this flashlight trying to return mine	10
0	i should have read the previous review before ordering because this product did not work at all the on off button did not work click the light produced a very faint light less than a cell phone emits do n't buy this product there are better flashlights out there	10
0	i purchased 5 of these for christmas presents i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time number 1 this was dead in the box so were numbers 2 3 and 4 i did n't bother with number 5 every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge there is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is real junk says hummer made in china and all five are going back	10
0	the item was broken when i received it also it is not what the picture looked liked very poorly made	10
0	this front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when i went over a medium sized rock	10
0	this fender is way to short on a 17 frame with 26 wheels 80 of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly the rear part is abuot 5 to short to stop most of the mud i got it to stop bricks damaging my giant bike frame and failed 2 stars for build of it and the 20 of mud it actualy stops do not buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for	10
0	this might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike but i laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped not very durable	10
0	the accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical \( who 's going to use a slingshot anyway \? \) but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage it 's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle	10
0	the motion sensor would n't turn it on it does not maintain calibration cold weather numbs it i'm tossing it out	10
0	this product never worked buttons were defective it would n't stay on it would n't calibrate the seller sky box usa would n't exchange or refund because i was outside of the 30 day window \( this was a christmas present and a very disappointing one at that \) you 'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a casio watch	10
0	do n't count on this compass or you will get lost it is not the least bit accurate	10
0	first the directions on assembling this product were in impossible to understand chinglish 2nd the gun broke immediately upon use hot import toys never answers their phone and never returns calls they will not help you do n't throw your money away on this one	10
0	i received my valeo ocelot training glove still waiting for the other bubble pack had only one glove in it amazon help has no concept of partial shipment	10
0	these balls are horrible they do n't bounce like regular balls worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight it goes to the sides most of the time	10
0	well today feb 25 of 2007 the book still do n't arrive	10
0	these ping pong balls were a waste of money none of them bounce correctly they either bounce off to the side or the only bounce a couple of inches they are also really soft and make a terrible sound when you play with them the seam is evident on all of them	10
0	i bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that i needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck the neck support that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck ouch ! i would strongly recommend against this purchase not only does it not work properly but the foam pads were stained upon arrival gross ! i will try another model	10
0	it may be a good piece of equipment but it's too big it's big because you can lean on it and do leg lifts etc but all i wanted to do were crunches it was hard to put together only because the screws would not fit into the slots i almost broke my fingers i gave it away and bought a smaller roller that works better for me	10
0	i ca n't believe they sell such a piece of c p ! after inserted the 9v battery i just pushed the button to start shuffling one time and i heard a cracking noise right away one piece of the mechanism fell off and i could hear it when shaking the box of course the shuffler was broken wished i could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c p in some store	10
0	i would n't recommend this shuffler to anyone it shuffles more from one side than the other when through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through the cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down the switch just works part time you have to stop and restart several times	10
0	i bought this for my four year old for christmas the net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper a week later his friend also four broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather weight plastic puck that comes with the set do n't waste your money even for little kids it 's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last	10
0	it really deserves a 0 rating non skid surface is a joke it is slick as glass tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg golden slipped off side and hurt her leg learn from my mistake there is nothing positive to say about this product	10
0	the present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use the newest presentation has solved this problem	10
0	this tool will not take an edge either with a grinder or a file it is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems which has undesirable consequences for your hand if you are looking for a useful tool keep looking	10
0	these coleman machetes are essentially useless they are so lightweight and flexible i do n't know what they intended them to be used for they will cut some weeds but they wo n't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1 2 inch i have used a few of these as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where i live they also rust badly you 're much better off with an ontario knife machete or another better machete	10
0	we were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure as it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square we were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of caves in we finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the outside of the poles that attach to all eight legs	10
0	these noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old she bonks herself with them my toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them they make fairly interesting noises but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size no one really plays with them much i would not recommend them	10
0	1 calories shown during a workout are about 1 5 to 2 times actual i do have the right weight entered in my user profile 2 machine broke right after warranty ran out no manual no reasonable support i paid 850 including shipping it is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly nothing about fixing this is intuitive some of the nuts and screwsare so tightly put on you cannot budge them i am going to throw this junk out and buy a non schwinn elliptical thathas a better warranty and real servicabilty customer support at1 800 864 1270 is practically useless save you rmoney buy something else	10
0	i loved the machine until it broke there's no friggin' technical support or repair options from schwinn they do n't care	10
0	we received this product for christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke we contacted schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console it is now may 1st and the console we need is still on backorder 5 months ! ! ! ! ! it is absolutely ridiciulous i call each week and i get the same response unfortunately we should have contacted amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from amazon lesson learned there the product when it was working was fine but the pain since then is not worth it i do not recommend this product	10
0	the first schwinn fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit the second one arrived but does not work after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re examine the contacts \( which i did \) it still does not work this is absolutely useless they will have to do something	10

0	the only reason why i am not buying this product is because the description does n't give the lengh how stupid ! ! ! i am sure i am not the only one to turn this great product down come on think a little and tell us how long it is	10
0	this stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done do n't know if it 's really misbehaving or it 's just on some obscure other function when i think i set it for countdown \? operating manual is available online pdf and it 's several pages long	10
0	i was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat i got neither it is pretty but that is about it	10
0	this would be a great rebounder if it were not so cheaply made one month after happily using it a spring broke then another it is one of the least expensive models out there and i guess there is a reason for that best to save your money and buy a more expensive model	10
0	i thougth that de signal is powered to rise 16 miles but it 's not real and the comunication is good only in open staces like one in front of the other anything that is in middle of the recievers cause interference or bad comunications	10
0	i previously owned and used the 5 mi version to communicate with my wife while i am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids from the bus stop the 5 mi unit was iffy i purchased the 16 mi units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop it was worse we received no signal whatsoever not a peep do n't buy this unit save your money and buy the 5 mi unit	10

0	i bought this exact one maybe a year ago about 2 months later it just collapses set up is not the onlt thing that is hard actully trying to get a high jump is very difficult this is a little kids toy but most little kids do n't just like baby bounces do they \? i would not recommend this trampoline to anybody	10
0	was billed by the company and they never sent it had to challenge the company to get a credit still waiting for my bill to see if credit was done	10
0	most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks i talked to dislike this product i 've used it a number of times myself and i would never use it again \( especially after i discovered better products \) it turns your chain and drive train into a black mess finish line was better triflow was recommended by a number of cyclists	10
0	nice looking skates but very stiff boot and runs too small do n't like the stiffness of the boot will not buy another rd product	10
0	do not buy this magazine ! ! ! ! it has been falsely advertised it does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30 it is the exact same magazine that comes with the high power steyr i bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today i feel completly ripped off	10
0	i ordered a product that showed a correct hinged replacement fixture for my igloo cooler but when it arrived what showed up was a completely different product of lesser stature and quality i will never order from them again	10
0	this is not the same model i bought but it looks like it 's built the same way i bought the inmotion trampoline by stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use it did n't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off when i called for warrantey information i had waited too long it is only guaranteed for 90 days i 'd give it negative stars but i have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
0	this watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood' but i am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather i was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch prone i cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for even if the altimeter worked correctly	10
0	i hate to rate this item poorly but it did n't work well for me i installed it in my basement it 's hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor everytime i hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down solid product for the right location	10
0	if your toes get hot it has a zipper for that \( useless \) better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom its small \( even the long one \) for a big guy i wouldnt use it for anything but the summer \( and you will most definatly need a good pad	10
0	the bag is nice and everything but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into also my feet got cold because of the zippered area not really sure i understand why it 's there my feet never get warm usually cold i liek the material and the look also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg night	10
0	its rickety the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion not worth half the money it goes for	10
0	the compass is wholly unreliable the light button turns on in your bag thus draining the battery one of my worst amazon purchases	10
0	the hr monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use no use any more also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists not at all comfortable on mine	10
0	this product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds i used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off	10
0	do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch this monitor is sold as providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout reebok did to substantiate this claim get a strapped monitor for working out while this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose	10
0	i only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began it started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else very annoying ! also the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse while it is a low impact machine it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals this is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout i am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine do not waste your money	10
0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems i put on the valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in my advice this product is poorly made and cheap a complete waste of money go with something better and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric	10
0	ummm why should i pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book	10
0	we would like to send this item back the construction was flimsy and the assembly is very cumbersome one of the pieces broke when it was being assembled the item was inexpensive but not worth the trouble to assemble	10
0	i found these gloves to be ok for short rides but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful i actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying granted these are mtn biking gloves i do n't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand i 've tried to break them in but after a dozen or more rides they are still stiff	10
0	i saw this design and thought it was a great idea after using it twice my wrists still hurt now i know why i could n't find this design at my local sporting goods store	10
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec 6 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service	10
0	the pogo stick that i ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail i have to say though that the return was easy the company had ups come to my house and pick up the product and i was given a full refund immediatly the item was not great but customer service was good	10
0	for one the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps secondly they spelled enhanced enchanced they may have even done this on purpose seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun it 's about 50 50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition	10
0	my friend and i both bought this gun we both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked i could throw bb 's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day in ten minutes only 1 bb came out of the barrel and it just rolled out it does n't work 'nuff said all it 's good for now is to be my back scratcher buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot bb 's they will work better than this gun thank you for your time good nigh	10
0	we bought two pairs of these \( his and hers sizes large and regular \) direct from the manufacturer the gloves in both sets were of different sizes and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use too bad because the concept is great	10
0	i purchased these so i would n't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat however they did n't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws additionally after only a few classes the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws particularly on the foot paws i guess they would be okay for someone who does n't ever have sweaty palms and who does n't do any intense postures otherwise i would recommend doing what i do now use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	10
0	the product is well made and a great idea for travel without a mat however i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating however although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface your skin slips out of them when you sweat making them worthless guess i will stick with having a towel around !	10
0	too big and cartoonish also very hard to get hands and arms in orout when fully inflated	10
0	other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason over 65 of the decks are marked and unusable that means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be ok for poker play \( unless you 're lucky \) i have purchase casino used cards before and honestly they are not worth the trouble	10
0	this gun is absolutley terrible the third time i shot it the thing broke ! the pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them i would tell you more of how bad this was but i really do n't want to waste any more of my time	10
0	description of bike was misleading weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds although i weigh slightly less than this i am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart i would not have purchased the bike had i seen this limit in the description also the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated i thought i was purchasing a simple exercise bike not such a complicated piece of machinery this bike would be perfect for a younger more athletic slimmer person	10
0	read the ingredients contains refined flour and sugar hydrogenated oil corn syrup and artificial colors for someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic this would be a poor substitute for real food i personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for you	10
0	this compass fails to do the one simple task i purchased it for which is simply telling me which direction i am going i spent for a compass made out of crap materials it works only for the direction you set it at for example if you set it while facing north it will be correct when you go north but if you change directions the result is completely random this compass only works for one direction and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually \( gasp \) might turn absolute rippoff	10
0	please advise me if i can get a new plu in senor temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work \? please advise asapthankswalter ga	10
0	the first one i bought started going crazy within a day the ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like eventually i could not even power it on i was told by pni global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours did that then it started breaking down again the temp sensor did not work because anywhere i placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold they sent me another one which did the same thing now i have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one \( my third ! ! ! \) the good news is that they are nice in customer service	10
0	this is a nice heavy item perfect for covering your trike but i have yet to figure out how to put it in place i'vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture my son \( yes he is a grown man \) put it on better than i had on my tries but the front wheel is still out they need to put some arrows on it or something ! ! ! barbara lynchwilliamsburg va	10
0	i was very excited to order this bike as i started to put it together i noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing ! i still attempted assembly and noticed that pre drilled holes were n't even close to being inline with the display ! the largest drawback and thing that upset me was that i did n't pay close enough attention when purchasing this it is does not allow for adjustment from seat to pedals i'm 6'3 tall and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable	10
0	these knives are terrific unless you actually want to use them i threw these knives into soft pine wood and they bent like crazy one of them bect almost 180 degrees ! if you want to throw these into something softer \( like pillows \) these may work but do n't expect to throw these into wood	10
0	title says it all dont purchase this to use with the thule t2	10
0	the item was packaged well but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate the lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened anyone want the rest of this can \? what a waste of time	10
0	not very bright for an led and guess what \? this is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so i do n't blame amazon but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this	10
0	this case is mainly made of plastic ! ! do n't be fooled by the aluminum description only the corners were aluminum the rest just painted plastic the case came poorly packaged ! the box was too small for the case the case had scuff marks and scratches on it obviously not brand new ! ! this was the worst purchase i 've ever made on amazon will never buy adg sports again ! ! ! their label was crooked on the case too ! ! looks like a 4 year old put it on ! ! don't waste your money ! trust me ! !	10
0	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle one of them worked perfect snug fit and everything worked the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic this is my second and last purchase from zefal i was happy it wasnt made in china but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis	10
0	though the concept of a heart rate monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient the mio is of absolutely no use during your workout you have to stop your activity \( be it running biking or walking \) to measure your current heart rate as your hand has to be steady the calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories	10
0	there is nothing wrong with this product it 's how you use it we almost ruined our 300 trampoline in it 's first week by using this product we put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine it rained the next day and filled completely with rain water causing the trampoline to nearly collapse it took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through by covering it you do n't allow it to drain unless you live in a very dry climate i do n't advise using a cover	10
0	this cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline but every single time it rains i have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle ! it is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly more damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it ! this is a worthless item	10
0	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other i would not recommend these for anyone	10
0	i take yoga in a gym the class starts as the aerobics session ends i bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot i expected more elastic they made my foot cramp during the class because i had worn them once i could not return them now i do not know what to do with them i should throw them out but i spent money on them	10
0	i got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k and it defiantly not 95 accurate i run 10 11 minute mile yet both on the treadmill and outside this watch was reading 7 5 to 8 minute mile distance was also off by 20 when running speed and distance 98 accurate for walking 15 min mile	10
0	the handles on these knives while having good balance are the weak point these knives are n't meant to be thrown after minimal use they broke at the handle	10
0	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck it would have been better with metal zipper	10
0	i bought this unit two months ago and since that time i have used it sparingly i went to turn it on today and it was dead so i went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one still dead i tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice unlike this so called 'rugged' unit a total waste of money be forwarned	10
0	have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed if you move the compass \( of your own choice or it falls off the windshield \) you need to recalibrate it i 've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction i have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness	10
0	if it were possible i would rate this item at no stars completely undependable requires constant recalibration lasting for all of a few minures have tried all the suggested remedies including new batteries nothing works next stop is the recycling center	10
0	i will not recommend this product i use it in my car and most of the time is wrong if you really need a compass you better read all reviews i usually do it but i could n't find about this product and well lucky it was only a few dollars	10
0	i should have heeded the bad reviews on this site i purchased this as a christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient it was dead on arrival i tried a new battery still dead on arrival both batteries tested ok clearly it 's a dead unit i contacted the new manufacturer \( not pni as advertised \) and am awaiting a response i ca n't recommend this product	10
0	this item was not very good setup instructions poor lighting poor cannot view screen at night forget it	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
0	i will never deal with this company again ! my product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun it would not work after we cleaned it and i got no response from the company i had to throw away the gun along with my money i have enjoyed amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with thank	10
0	i bought this product on a friday and arrived on a thursday good shipping time but a horrible gun the pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic the whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying i payed 30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday complete waste the laser 's wires split the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the fps \( feet per second \) is slower than my berretta pistol also the binoculars are cheap as well it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the	10
0	i would easily be able to rip this box open i refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly	10
0	i bought this for my 5 yr old and he ca n't even get it on his head he wears other youth bike helmets so i would n't recommend this item unless it 's for a 2 3 yr old now i have to pay half the price in return shipping	10
0	this bigwheel is so poorly made you have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on we put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay the seat back has cracked already and we 've only owned it one month the tassles on the handles do n't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction lastly there is no breaking mechanism anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to skid out ! keep looking	10
0	a real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings if not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main \( front \) sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if very heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal mart or target for half the price	10
0	i ordered this pilates ring because i had used one in my health club big mistake it is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless would n't even be of much use for a wheelchair bound old lady \( the vendor sent it fast though	10
0	horrible the trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing this is the second product form stamina that came in damaged i would not recomend to anyone	10
0	well first of all i never folded it up because it was very difficult to fold so i would just roll it into a closet i would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise i had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and i had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard i weigh 110 lbs ! i really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person	10
0	if i could give them 0 stars i would i do n't know why they even still make these as they should be illegal and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate the materials break up easily the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place i could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior but complete garbage right out of the box everlast in general simply is n't good low quality materials design and workmanship but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book i recommend buying entirely ringside and this is coming from an experienced full contact fighter	10
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me i urge you to buy something else	10
0	the description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction but this only applies to the top section the bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic on top of that of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center though that i could care less about if i had to do it all over again i would have purchased perfect pushup by bodyrev which amazon sells	10
0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company i just received my weslo cadence c44 treadmill and have attempted to assemble it the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console the customer service numbers are all disconnected their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them this company is a complete scam if you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked	10
0	who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs \? \? \? \? are only skinny people allowed to loose weight \? please find a brain and make it those of us who really need it	10
0	for several days i wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch on every occasion the watch did not count all the steps	10
0	yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps but it does n't keep your hair dry at all	10
0	basically the title says it all i figured for a 100 dollars i would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge basically this is a poorly made toy that should n't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred like i said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the tru break putt 'n hazard the only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet	10
0	never received product ordered 6 of the flashlights on dec 3 for christmas presents e mailed seller several times to find out where order was they never answered my e mails good way to do business !	10
0	getting the flashlight is a real problem after paying for expedited shipping on dec 1 meaning dec 8th at the latest arrival still waiting on the 17th called customer service who promised to call back in 10 minutes never heard back on status filed a claim for reimbursement on the item	10
0	i just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym i now have painful calluses in my palm the glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand	10
0	thi is hotimporttoys at their finest they are advertising this as a bullet \( bb \) proof mask for use in airsoft that leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says not suitable for children under 3 years now why would it say that \? this mask is meant to be a toy yet h i t is saying this will stop bb 's do n't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured or even killed \? \? \? i think this really needs to be looked at by amazon this could seriously kill someone	10
0	hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it	10
0	my buddy died wearing this mask well he did n't die but he lost his eye the mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye	10
0	i dont have this item but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is 100 and they are selling it for 2 50 ! ! !	10
0	i bought both the nordic gear batter heated gloves and battery heated mittens neither product provides adequate heat the batteries work but you get only a tiny bit of warmth i see from the other reviews that my complaint is common i wish i had read the reviews before buying	10
0	i trained for a marathon and several 10k races using a heart rate monitor they are very good instruments for training and i recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape after you 've purchased one or two of them you become a better shopper i purchased an f 4 for a friend and i was very very disappointed in the battery life when i found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out some of the newer heart monitors nikon for one have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10

0	do n't be fooled by the positive posts i am convinced they are bogus this is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices	10
0	need i say more \? the ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor 's yard thankfully no one was hurt	10
0	when i saw that most of the critical parts the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic i told my wife this is n't going to last long in the very place i had concerns is where mine broke a simple metal pin instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference i also just noticed in these customer reviews that right after someone posts a negative review a positive albeit anonymous review is posted that always makes me wonder	10
0	broke first time i used it when it worked it was highly inaccurate \( i own a radar speed detector \) save your money	10
0	the first time i used it i hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods my mom had ordered it from sharper image she called them and they said the would replace the ball they never did i have not found a place to order replacement parts	10
0	hydrolized gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend do a search on that and you 'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones mmmmm does n't that sound good \? what 's more this gelatin protein is incomplete so it does n't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles it may taste ok but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them or just eat jello if you really want gelatin avoid ones with collagen too same issue	10
0	i ordered a wobble balance board from everyting fitness and it came from karate depot and does n't even look like the product i ordered i only give 1 star because i ca n't give zero starts	10
0	while this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application session use of 20 min the second time i tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min even after getting new batteries \( which turned out not to be the problem \) i tried to get the belt to work like before but realized i was scammed it is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones	10
0	i really think i wasted money for buying this stuff it 's just worthless and not working at all	10
0	i received a phone msg from the vendor two days after i ordered this item from amazon a day after i received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address and if i had another address outside california to ship it to i thought it was strange since i only have one address i was looking forward to geting this item too	10
0	i bought this item based on other people 's reviews i'm sad to say they were wrong maybe it 's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box the gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as i started firing it it sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go my recommendation well just look at my title	10
0	when i got this gun i thought it looked really cool but when i tried to shoot it the bullets just rolled out of the barrell ! the few bullets that did shoot worked well i did not have a good experience with this gun	10
0	let me just start by saying this gun is terrible the images are misleading the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic but it is a dull black and it smells really badly at first not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps and is sold at 300 my friends did n't even notice being shot i have a 300 fps pistol it leaves welts through jeans this isnt 300 fps it 's a rifle fit for an infant who 's been dropped on their head and thinks it 's good never even shot farther than 80 feet bad buy	10
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost you get what you pay for she uses it a few times a week after a little more then a month the left pedal broke she is not overweight at all so that was n't the problem i 'll spend the money for a good one next time	10
0	this is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs it is fairly quiet not silent it is shakier than i had hoped the wire to the monitor came broken	10
0	i recently purchased the stamina elliptical it took me a day and a half to put together the meter did n't work so i called customer service and they sent another one out immediately it makes a lot of noise and it 's not very sturdy i would return it but it would take too long to dis assemble i would n't recommend this product	10
0	i bought this pedometer for myself and bought my wife a 20 omron pedometer and hers' is far superior easier to set up more accurate durable lesson spend a few dollars more for something that works well this one is disposable junk	10
0	if it is kept in the hilt it makes for a decent wall piece if you pull it out of the hilt it is not a good thing my sword has a bent blade and a bent handle which was noticable while in the hilt i would not spend the money on this item	10
0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top when we put that top on we found the same thing that is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product	10
0	i got this zafu \( meditation cushion \) it is round in shape and too high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on around 9 inches high and 15 18 inches in diameter it is also pretty heavy around 4 pounds due to the sheer size i could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it i would recommend trying it somewhere before buying the filling seemed of good quality	10
0	it works like a hook for clothes of my wife	10
0	i got this item to give a a gift i got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded do n't bother with this one	10
0	three of these broke granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed but to no avail my wife received something similar from spri \( doctor 's tubing \) and it has lasted for a few years now	10
0	i might be an idiot but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on ! haha so many velcro straps and what not neither me nor my father who 's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly again maybe i'm just an idiot	10
0	this is a 22 tee ball \? maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place since these should cost about 2 at your local sporting goods store maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package \( but it does n't say that clearly on the page \) bottom line is do n't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue	10
0	this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else the first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable after a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit amazon promptly replaced the treadmill this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function my friend at tech support did not have a clue he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit it is not clear what i am to do with them i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer	10
0	this is not as described it is very hard to move heavy and bulky if you have a place to set it up and leave it fine but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the tv' as described performance wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use i'm disappointed	10
0	after 2 attempts at having this shipped to me and both times having it arrive broken i have given up this model it 's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating if you can buy one at the store it may be a great unit but do n't let it go ups	10
0	this is not the fault of amazon or even the product i wasused to a gym quality rower \( conceptii \) which allows a lot of resistance the integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance i am in the process of sending it back the machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge an expensive lesson	10
0	the goal arrived at my house assembled wrong then after it was fixed be me i successfully put it together which was relativly easy after several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net that is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak the weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post overall this is probably not a good buy	10
0	i own two and have had problems with both even when pre heated coffee tea is luke warm 3 hours later sturdy product should be for it is pretty heav	10
0	prior to purchasing this item i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe i wish i heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis i developed severe toe pain by using this product i then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead	10
0	i ordered the igloo quick and cool 150 from target i had it 2 days after ordering it was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used back it went be careful ordering from target in january they have to do something with those christmas returns check out the product carefully	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	this airbed leaked slowly from day one i sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one i do not recommend this product	10
0	do n't ever buy this it is a rip off and a gimmick your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one	10
0	living in florida i bought two of these everlight flashlights the party that said there was enough charge during shippins is a little shaking in the head it takes at least a couple of minutes of of shaking before there is even a glimmer of light after that if you don't continue to shake it dies out very rapidly this light may possibly come in handy during a hurricane power failure but there are other led flashlights with batteries that are superior to this one the power used by these leds is low and the batteries last a long time	10
0	i have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one this one puts out a a poor amount of light it also does not retain its charge well you will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged i would say it is one of the worst ones i purchased	10
0	it holds my bike but seems unstable i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards plus probably the biggest concern there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack \( user must tie the bike down every time \) my bike has n't fallen off though	10
0	the light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive even with batteries the xenon light did not work so now i have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries the case was nice however	10
0	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles and pins while camping then this is the item for you the instructions are made only to confuse things more it could be made so much more user friendly once it 's up it gets a thumbs up	10
0	not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower this is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty not usable as a shower good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower	10
0	this product does not work the vendor is great though they refunded our money very quickly we were very disappointed because it is a great idea	10
0	i already have a good quality fitball stability ball that i really like and only bought this set to get the dvd i had planned to give the ball to a family member but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant so it will probably just get thrown out the included pump is a piece of junk so even if you do want to use the low quality ball you 'll need to find another way to inflate it finally mindy mylrea is a good instructor but the music sound quality were lacking and i ended up not liking the workout so in the end i got rid of the dvd as well	10
0	i love the workout dvd that comes with it but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses very disappointed with this product	10
0	do not order from this company as amount will be charged to your account \( as mine was \) and i never got the item i emailed the company and never heard a word amazon is crediting my account after i made a complaint unsatisfactory company	10
0	i am disappointed with this product as i thought i was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which i give to my patients this one is made of nylon and elastic the stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use the elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart go with the stretch out strap which i have been very pleased with	10
0	how can this table be used with face hole \? either 1 \) use no sheets ie client lies directly on vinyl or2 \) fitted sheet covers hole ie client cannot breathe neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable	10
0	disliked table each time table was set up legs had to be attached by the support rods this was not an easy process nor done quickly the face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable 1 star for this item is too much for my usage and review i sent it back	10
0	i ditto the previous reviewer i thought these seats were adjustable was i wrong there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down suck	10
0	this was one of our worst purchases rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better ! the snorkle and mask were constant problems leaking filling with water etc we had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up	10
0	if your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go but the fins are low quality and i would only wear them if i wanted to get laughed at	10
0	the jacket works well for shedding water which is n't really losing positive weight the pants rip during the first work out i 've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woould n't rip but they did save your money unless you just want to jacket	10
0	received this suit yesterday and used today for first time you do sweat but as one of the other reveiwers mentioned i took off the pants and they tore horizontally thru the crotch seam one wearing and kaput written to valeo will see what they repl	10
0	the suit will make you sweat if that 's what you are looking to do i had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam i was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine it will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses but buy something more substantial for a serious workout you truly do get what you pay for	10
0	i received the exercise bike put it together as soon as i got it and started using it just looking at it i had second thoughts about buying it ten minutes later it broke some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside i contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me one more thing even if it had n't broken the resistance setting on this thing is horrible you get absolutely no resistance on it that means no workout	10
0	received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it you ca n't get it to pedal the cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike you need a heavier base and very smooth cycling this model runs on a fabric type band on the inside made very cheap i don't recommend	10
0	this tiny item ships for 2 more than it costs i 'll purchase it elsewhere	10
1	this monster is great my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit we heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor luckily she had n't gone to her attorney 's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all thanks toilet monster you were worth the 15 5 shipping we paid for you	10
1	on the basis of the first review here i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up i use it every day	10
1	the gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding i took it with me on vacation to florida and two of my friends one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints saw it started using it and loved it so i ordered two more !	10
1	my son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger it was easy to put togther and is very durable i would highly recommend it he also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants	10
1	i bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair i am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web or other computer work it helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around it is exactly what i was looking for	10
1	this machine really makes you feel it i like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great the only thing i can say is i wish it folded up for better storage but other than that i like it	10
1	make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this i like using it when i'm at home and do n't feel like going to the gym i cardio \( running or something \) afterwards it 's really effective if your form is correct	10
1	this is a great exercise ball it is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines let me tell you ! ! ! it is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and i can really feel my muscles working out it helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility this is a great product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	10
1	the last ball i had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it i'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time i need a little more air the pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too at my kids birthday party i used it to fill some inflatable decorations and i 've used it to fill an air mattress so two things the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy	10
1	great product i just received my ball today i could n't wait to work out if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max fitness	10
1	i recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while one of the suggestions i got was to get a gripmaster and when i checked it out i found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers i ordered one and i can definitely say it was a good investment ! there 's a big difference in my grip now i can even crack a nut with one hand easily \( using a nutcracker of course \) i ca n't wait to try the 7 lb one	10
1	i love my treadmill ! my son put it together for me and he had no trouble i love all the options on this treadmill i use only the basic so far but i can see the benefit in having the pre programmed workouts i ca n't wait to get there to try it ! it 's hard to say enough about this machine it 's a great machine	10
1	i use the ir interface with the polar s625x running computer and i have never encountered a single problem i usually use the interface in to different computers a notebook at home \( with xp \) and a desktop at work \( 2000 \) and in both computers it works nicely you have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the ir interface install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer i love my polar watch and the ir interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product	10
1	initially i had some trouble figuring out the right port to use but now it works and i 've used it constantly for at least 2 years	10
1	i did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery my fears proved wrong i received a heavy package not damage with all contents inside the bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike	10
1	my physician told me to exercise or else so i looked at comsumer reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike amazon 's price was great and i have been delighted if you like to read and exercise this one 's for you	10
1	i love these workouts they are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners the best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day my only complaints with this series were the lack of attention billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves all in all this was a great purchase for me i will probably purchase the new bootcamp elite series	10
1	we just got it i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and i let it sit for a day and a half it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight this works perfectly	10
1	fantastic product i am a group fitness instructor and i use this product everyday i add a banana peanut or cashew butter plain yogurt ice and water this is in lieu of dinner i do n't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up	10
1	safety key was fine except i purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size i was looking for i took a chance at the size so my own fault	10
1	the item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says it is great	10
1	i bought this mat for my exercise bike it was large and gave my floor great protection i would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment	10
1	so many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it ! that 's not what it 's supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is my friend who is probably about 250 lbs did n't even pop it	10
1	the backpack is great it is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy you can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it it secures well and dogs love it if you give a dog a job they really feel useful and i think they appreciate it a lot	10
1	i 've had one of these for 13 years one for thirteen years it still works great please use it carefully if you 're going to use it you can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure \( or not \) repetitive stress syndrome to completely avoid that and any similar problems you 'll need dr sonnon but in the meantime just be careful	10
1	this is the first product i 've ever bought to work out my forearm so i ca n't compare it to anything else but i will say it does work i 've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it it 's comfortable and easy to use i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder though	10
1	yes i like it after using for 2 weeks my fingers were strong good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body	10
1	on the basis of the first review here i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up i use it every day	10
1	this tools is really really great it helped me to overcome the problem i faced while playing guitar specially the barre chords	10
1	i use the ir interface with the polar s625x running computer and i have never encountered a single problem i usually use the interface in to different computers a notebook at home \( with xp \) and a desktop at work \( 2000 \) and in both computers it works nicely you have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the ir interface install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer i love my polar watch and the ir interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product	10
1	bought this bike for my wife it arrived a day late for the next day delivery the packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok the directions for assembly could n't have been more clear and easy to understand it took me about an hour taking my time to put it together the bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time also very comfortable	10
1	baby einstein has done it again ! they have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love the best part of it is \( they call it \) the activity star it 's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at the activity star has different settings for playing music on short play and motion activated it 's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star tip that flash along with the music my 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights compared to other play mats in the same price range this one is the best \( in my opinion \)	10
1	we bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old he would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time which bought me time to do housework around him etc you can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there 's always variety i 'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl i bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the 35 i spent i would n't spend much more than that	10
1	it had special meaning for me because when my two daughters were little \( they are now in their late 30s \) i taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they did n't flush i caught them both with the toilet monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences it is more funny than scary though it does give you a start when you first open the lid	10
1	most posters here have n't actually bought used a toilet monster it 's a really great joke prank we bought one and used it for my mother in law she was stunned and a bit disoriented then wait for it she laughed really really hard it 's not scary just startling the way we installed it if someone opens the lid and seat they wo n't see it so it 's best to try on women great for the price	10
1	this monster is great my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit we heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor luckily she had n't gone to her attorney 's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all thanks toilet monster you were worth the 15 5 shipping we paid for you	10
1	i bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab great dane mix and it is pretty big on him admittedly he 's still pretty skinny despite his weight but i had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him probably better for broader dogs but i'm sure mine will grow into it o \) the quality is excellent and there 's plenty of packing space overall i'm pleased with it especially for the price if your dog is skinny narrow i 'd order the next smaller siz	10
1	we just got it i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and i let it sit for a day and a half it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight this works perfectly	10
1	i use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane i do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow it rolls up to a nice compact size	10
1	i guess i did not read the description an adapter is required to properly use this i will either buy the special adapter or adapt it to my bike rack	10
1	we got this bike for our 4 year old and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years the assembly instructions looked intimidating at first but since many pieces are already pre assembled you can skip most of them it was a lot easier than anticipated the only reason why i gave it 4 stars it had a deep scratch paint chip on the frame but since i got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway	10
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far it is built well and the price was awesome	10
1	we bought this tent to travel with our newborn to the beach and it is amazing the setup is quick and we are the envy of all beachgoers it is lightweight and well constructed i highly recommend this to all who desire shade and comfort	10
1	this is the best ! i love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves its made me a better runner my husband loves when i take it to his tight shoulders i can massage him so much longer than i could before this is a great purchase	10
1	never thought i 'd own a hyd pack but now i do n't know what i 'd do without one this company offers free lifetime tip replacement previous reviews are accurate no initial taste or odor take proper care for long periods of storage \( rinse with lemon juice or baking soda \) and you 'll enjoy a long life out of this zippered pocket is nice too	10
1	this is exactly what i wanted ! i 've had so many slipping problems in my ashtanga yoga class both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses here is the answer ! it works great ! i'm very happy	10
1	i was skeptical of buying this because i was n't sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class i had been using a towel for a while but it was n't helping this product is amazing and i do n't slide around at all anymore i even bought one for my friend and she loves it too i bought a yellow mat because i loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more obviously it washes out but it 's visible during class definitely worth the money !	10
1	this is a fantastic product at an incredible price i am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better it has completely eliminated my lower back pain the chiropractor never did that buy this table	10
1	we researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model this is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table the ankles are comfy and secure the dvd shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right as you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design the best part is using it it feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas i ca n't wait to use it again we love it	10
1	this wiffle bat is light and easy to use substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse it will not hurt the horse but will get the horse 's attention	10
1	one thing i really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use it holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride it feels good on your back too it helps in this florida heat cons the mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle it would be easier to have a t mouth piece i will be looking for a replacement	10
1	this is a minimalist kit which is n't really suited for everyone it is also overpriced for the items in it what it is good for is to get you thinking what you need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact overall it 's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing	10
1	these skates were a bithday gift for my child the really fit well and will roll well even on our dirt drive	10
1	this skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a santa gift the hit of the day ! although she has n't had much opportunity to use them yet she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine they are nice looking and fit is true to size	10
1	i wanted a simple portable way to enjoy moving my body more this is it i just hop on it during commercials or when i need to get up and move from my desk it works	10
1	my husband and i purchased this bike to replace my 4 year old son 's 12inch toddler bike our son loves that the bike looks like a big kid 's bike with it 's hand brake i was concerned that my son would n't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work but he has had no problems ! in addition the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards this bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes !	10
1	i purchased the valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball this ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it this ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball plus it is the same size of an official size men 's basketball color is also very nice	10
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs	10
1	in these days and times backpacks bookbags etc have become so outlandish this is a classically styled all american backpack no bells no whistles just a good ole standbye bag ! hard to find now a days	10
1	my second pair knew exactly what i wanted small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly great deal	10
1	this rack works perfect for me it as easy to assemble and its easy to use it folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use my bikes have curved cross bars so this mounting style was my only option and it works great	10
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob	10
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship i did n't really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword	10
1	the leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage \( throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my leeks ! \) fortunately kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked i just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife the knife itself opens beautifully though i 've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and is n't that easy to depress with one hand	10
1	i am very satisfied by this short sword and by its cutting abilities the sheath however is very soft and prevents the sword from quickly putting in it	10
1	this sword is awesome i thought it would be cheap metal because of the price but it is even better than some of the other swords i bought for more money	10
1	the item is nice but 15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous i know that if you shipped two of them together it would n't cost 15 for both of them let alone separately and everyone wonders why their items are so cheap	10
1	this ninja sword is nice and has a light on it that makes it even coole	10
1	overall i'm very happy with this mat at first i was n't sure i was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two i also initially did n't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it would n't lay flat but i solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did just turned it over	10
1	thanx for the great mat ! i hope to become a better golfer because of it	10
1	very well made product easy assembly and mounting the no wobble feature is excellent highly recommend this product	10
1	this bike mount is solid and well made the instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly there is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted the only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames we added some padding and taped it on and it works fine however	10
1	the item was delivered quickly as advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine i would purchase again from this supplier	10
1	this rack was great and easy to install but i never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night i installed it some person backed into and ran off what made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch since i was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off i painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands over all i though it was a great rack i just wished someone did not back into it but i know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car truck	10
1	the mirror and its attachment is better than the ones i have purchased however the attachment does not addapt to all helmets i have two helmets by specialized one i had no problem attaching to the other the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly it would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets this would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment whether or not you print this review does not matter to me this review is intended for your design department thanks for the mirror	10
1	this is our second set of eyeglass mirrors they are easy to use and once you get used to using them you do n't want to go anywhere without them i even find myself checking my mirror when i'm walking and do n't have it on one drawback that we 've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent but that has n't really been an issue for us give these easy to use mirrors a try i wo n't ride without one	10
1	works like a thermarest easy to roll up and store wish i did n't have to buy the carrying case separately	10
1	the thule sidekick was the perfect size not too big not too small it did not appear clunky big on top of the car nor was it too small to fit anything in the assembly was a snap \( did it with only one person no problem \) it withstood freeway speeds in oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box highly recommended	10
1	i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx just the right size the box was easy to assemble less than an hour it is also easy to attach to the vehicle the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well the box is sturdy after assembling i	10
1	i am very happy with the trainer most impressively it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer i can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family i ride about 30 minutes a day on it it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program	10
1	practice sword is of superior quality for the price it cannot be beat	10
1	you wo n't believe how many exercises you can do on this home gym it takes up very little space and there 's even a diet plan included	10
1	i just wanted to comment on sarah 's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated i took it in parts after reading it fully twice after all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard overall i got it done in parts total time 2 5hrs with breaks in between have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten	10
1	this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps the distance is much greater and the hop up the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns o yea make sure u buy extra clip	10
1	great if you need more mags get this it fits perfect it is exactly what it says it is	10
1	its weighted and feels quite real it only holds 40 bbs unlike said in the product review buy a bunch of these at the same time because this company has outrageous shipping charges i recommend taping two together \( facing different directions \) to reduce reloading time in a match	10
1	does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks the active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal	10
1	the drishti yoga strap is just great ! i 've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga \( several different studios borrowed friends' etc \) this one is excellent it 's 2 feet longer than standards straps but it 's offered at the same price as standard straps what a deal ! it 's also thick and sturdy i would certainly recommend this product	10
1	this is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else it is also useful for true accurate training but a little humor never hurts	10
1	my grandson is very happy with this gift it was well represented and arrived in plenty of time for christmas i would purchase from this retailer again	10
1	so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand not to safe missing file holder is the only reason i do n't give it five stars	10
1	as the 'blow up' float toys come and go the sea breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float the only problem is sharing we love it	10
1	the ball is good overall one big issue however is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then you 'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime yeah i used it on a indoor wooden court	10
1	i bought this for my brother as a christmas gift he is an avid ballplayer and he loves it he says the surface feels a little different than other synthetic balls but it plays really well	10
1	this product is wonderful ! it sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music we received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2 5 years old and still loves it we keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear	10
1	i had this set up in my daughter 's crib when she was a baby it would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake the music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think the unit would turn itself off after a period of time so i would n't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her this is a wonderful crib toy i would recommend it for any newborn especially those who have a hard time falling asleep	10
1	my husband is an airline pilot and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements there frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports this is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store thanks for offering these by the case	10
1	i ordered this for my daughter when she played t ball she played on the cubs team and it was great very durable and adjustable	10
1	my daughter loves this toy it 's brightly colored and she loves the honking legs the tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster i really do n't see how a child could strangle themselves with it	10
1	this is a very good lock in this price range the rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night the only downside is the key you must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning otherwise you might bent the key	10
1	this is the best product of its kind that we could find we bought an extension as well all the pieces are light and easy to move i highly recommend it it 's a good thing amazon sells it since toysrus is discontinuing it	10
1	my kids love it they play for hours in the garage it keeps them away from the television and computer in the winter they are also exercising while having fun	10
1	what a beautiful bicycle ! ! i thought it was black and white from the photo but it 's a really lovely forest green and white it was really easy to put together myself my husband is really excited about it he 's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser very happy with this purchase ! great price too ! my own schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much	10
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here these are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc the length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves the 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts that is why ringside makes different lengths there is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	10
1	these are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps as such they 're 108 long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands men should use 180 wraps everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on amazon	10
1	i have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym my size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car i am not sure if someone with a large shoe size say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes \( basketball shoes \) may find the bag a tight squeeze overall very satisfied	10
1	my 12 year old daughter and i put together the trampoline in a few minutes i use it for exercise i watch tv or put on the ipod and run on it of course the kids like to use it to jump it is lightweight and easy to move around highly recommended	10
1	the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size but the blue cover for the edge which is round i will rate it a 1 is very poor for the price paid for yes it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on	10
1	i paid less for this item then i would at a store and it came to me ! i did n't have to carry a heavy item out to my vehicle hassle with getting it into the trunk and drag it into the house it was right there on my door step waiting for me i love amazon	10
1	when i first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant the other thing i do n't like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying	10
1	this works pretty well to get back and forth between classes although you can tell that it 's a toy at heart if you 're looking for something fun and easy i recommend this scooter	10
1	we are teaching my 6yo to ride a bike but it 's not going well he wanted a scooter so i got him the razor a2 and ordered the razor pro for me very nice ! supports my weight is easy to maneuver and is inexpensive ! the only problem is folding it up again when we 're done this is sometimes a bit tricky	10
1	we bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday he loves it ! his older brother \( 3 1 2 \) has the regular razor scooter but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself this kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother good for the younger kids but it does not go as fast as the regular razor as a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two definetly worth the money though he just loves it !	10
1	i looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1 2 year old autistic son to use to bounce on everything was too big and too expensive this ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly	10
1	included pump is very weak better to inflate the bed using your own mouth	10
1	i had the original solid red victorinox that was borrowed and never returned \( it was about 10 years old and still going strong ! \) so i purchased this one i came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire amethyst and red for christmas gifts everyone loved them ! small in size but a real workhorse and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk it came in handy opening the boxes that were taped and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now i definitely recommend this product if you have very large hands or need a larger blade buy a larger knife otherwise this is the one you want	10
1	the kermis is bad to the bone fast this is not a bike for the average 'fred' the kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight there is an element of stability on climbis descents too as the bike is a flat out roadster i'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid kermis in hommage to this great road machine	10
1	i bought this for my son who is 4 he loves it and can operate it whith out any help good quality and can take alot of abuse	10
1	the directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up however at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement \( i e driving to work \? \? \) therefore for the most part its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps i take each day has been invaluable	10
1	he 's always been a colts fan but with their superbowl hype this football could n't have come at a better time happy birthday d ! ca n't offer anything but good reviews on the quality and look of the football	10
1	great condition made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs and the dolphins are my team ! ! \( she wo n't forget her gave her this one ! \) quick service great packaging	10
1	i 've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great do n't bother useing the scope though it 's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway this gun is great for mid range rapid fire do n't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it do n't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it 's been drop banged up and runs like new so yea get it ! ! ! !	10
1	allright thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for its accurate and its an incredible price its pretty hard hitting i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away im not new to airsoft and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this oneif you take it out to have a little fight with your friends i reccommend extra clips the mag capacity is about 45 and the load time is annoyingly longa very good gun for all abilitie	10
1	i purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong ! i use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect	10
1	we bought this for our 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loves it ! it goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride brakes work very well riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius given the chopper style long nose quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall i suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety easy to put together a no brainer well worth the cost he told us he loves feeling the wind in his face shirt sleeves flapping i think we have started something i may not want to deal with as he gets older future harley riders look out !	10
1	very satisfied to find this speedometer available perfect to put with my schwinn cruiser deluxe 7 had been searching for something like this for awhile would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear	10
1	i am a 71 yrs young female i purchased these men 's skates for myself i bought a size larger and they are very comfortable as an older re learner these skates worked out just great the wheel 's do n't have speed which is what i was looking for they are indoor outdoor skates they work better for inside skating a great price and a great quality skate especially for a beginner \( the wheels \) no matter what age you are these skates are the best i love these skates	10
1	i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy	10
1	while i live and run in what i consider a safe neighborhood i feel just a little safer having this baby on my hand just in case and especially when it 's still dark in the mornings i also carry it when i'm walking my dogs in the afternoon	10
1	i bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in colorado i recently went in january and it worked nearly perfect ! every location i could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet the thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly the watch looks great i wear it to work nearly every day i would highly recommend it	10
1	i am the leader of a team called point 0 i got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks it shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more the scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night it holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top but do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping i am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks	10
1	i order this gun from hit on april 11 and i got this baby at april 14 quick shipping and delivery this gun is very powerful 350 380 fps with 0 12g 6mm bbs very accurate too 5 5 to hit ! and 5 5 to this gun	10
1	i 've been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it 's just the dead battery the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it 's actually easier than it looks i highly recommend this gun	10
1	this gun shoots hard and fast ! ! ! this is a metal gear box so it last forever ! ! ! this is a must buy ! ! ! believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good ! !	10
1	this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition all metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal	10
1	this lunch box is top quality with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two the quality is superior and i highly recommend it there is an area for your flatwear salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks there is even a compartment for your soda i have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it great for travel work and picnics for two	10
1	these cars can be summed up in two words fun and loud i have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends they work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well i am even thinking of getting a third they do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily well worth it	10
1	when the buggie arrived it did n't work i had to call razor 's customer service dept their service is awful the senior agent was very rude i managed to figure out the problem on my own the electrical unit was not connected once it was connected it worked fine we have two of them the kids love them they are lightweight and ride well on carpet overall the product is good	10
1	i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money	10
1	the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised great folks to work with now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily i 'd sure buy that too	10
1	i 'd do business with these guys again the shipment made it on time and was just as i expected the only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when i opened the box	10
1	yea man soon as i got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great b bal	10
1	this little device is easy to put together and easy to use not for 'intensive' workouts however you can pretty much use it anyplace you 're sitting down that could mean even while the tv is on ! like all exercise equipment if you do n't use it you lose it	10
1	works great keeps me from spilling on myself especially when i have ice in there does n't slip fits just right easy to get in and out the bottle top screws right over it i can toss it in the silverware spot in my dishwasher to wash	10
1	hot water in my flask does n't stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature i have n't tried heating water from cold it is always at least warm when i start it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug does n't \( it flops about \) so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush	10
1	this is a must for car tent camping the main burner will boil 2 qts of water in about 5 minutes large enough to cook a complete meal small enough to be easy to pack	10
1	a great multifunctional stove with lots of room extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind dust and other campground debris out of your food propane is the only way to go when you 're cooking in the wild woods were doing some backwoods camping while the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along a must have for any camping trip	10
1	the computer is really good and installs quite easily the only problem is the setting instructions for the functions \( in 11 languages \) they are not very good \( as noted in another review i read \)	10
1	this bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use it is simple to install works great is easy to navigate and is actually kind of fun to use i love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed distance etc and when i'm whipping down the trail i really like to look down and see how fast i'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons	10
1	these are great cards they can be bent and even get wet and the are still good as new they are easily cleaned with a damp cloth perfect for the avid card player	10
1	this is a great helmet my daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it	10
1	i have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather over the years i have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size this cot will provide everthing that i'm looking for my sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot the cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag the only down side to the cot is it 's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag in short it 's all a good fit and i hope to enjoy it for years to come thanks da	10
1	sword looks awesome ! very heavy and cool blade is strong but not sharp for collector purposes handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky but can be fixed quickly overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking	10
1	received as promised easy to assemble and works well though the fly wheel is making noise and will most likely require servicing	10
1	this is a great stroller and an awesome price on amazon i wish i had it 2 years ago it folds nicely and is n't very heavy to lift in my van i use it for walking and the swivel wheel is great	10
1	i just ordered this basket and it came in a totally different color instead of the purple blue it is a light aqua blue color the basket is still cute it just does n't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have i am sure she will love it just as much ! i just wanted to give everyone the heads up !	10
1	this is one of the best racquets i have ever purchased ever since i used this racquet i have been playing better the racquets smooth motion makes it suitable for people of all skill levels	10
1	arrived just in time for the snow my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun however it requires the user to have good balancing skills like a skateboard i would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl	10
1	i got this for my daughter awhile ago but due to no snow i had to wait to actually see if it worked well it did ! nicely made and durable daughter loved it	10
1	the best bike ramp i have ever used this ramp is good for going slow or fast my friends and i went as slow as we could over it and we did not get stuck this ramp will not breack i live in an area of the country were it snows all the time and this ramp can handle the seasons this ramp has been outside for two years and is in great condision	10
1	this is a real good ramp i just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air ! overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major it is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time they are fun and you will have hours of fun ! ! ! \) \)	10
1	a quality product low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over easy to assemble ca n't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside ! have been riding it inside mostly using our legs \( we 're not yet 2 yrs old \) to scoot around however our bigger cousin \( just turned 5 yrs old \) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars this trike will last a long time and thru many kids	10
1	very impressive though it 's a bit big for my two year old he ca n't reach the peddles yet but manages to push himself around without too much trouble i think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old or a big two year old seems solidly built very sturdy stable and sporty looking	10
1	this little trike is wonderful ! ! ! my 2 1 2 year old loves it as does our 5 year old neighbor the ride is smooth and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers without the high risk of tipping over i looked for a trike for many hours days and am so happy with this choice	10
1	great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard it provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends another product that i found quite valuable is the ultimate golf instruction guide key techniques for becoming a zero handicap golfer or better by patrick leonardithis book has very practical information on the short game and long game which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course for leisure reading i also suggest new rules polite musings from a timid observer by bill maherthis book is hilarious very funny observations about famous people in the world	10
1	i bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours my girlfriend unwrapped the box on christmas day and filled it that afternoon it had ice still 2 days later sturdy effective and comfortable to drink from i'm going to buy myself one too	10
1	however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out ofthant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently	10
1	i ca n't not imagine having a great machete and it 's easy for me to imagine many things i would want one for this one is cheap not very big and of good enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush chopping and would be fine of fighting too if you had too truly unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete or really do n't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and do n't play jumanji or perhaps you have no arms this machete is for you ! with care chop on chop on samkoche	10
1	the best thing about this lantern is that it is rechargeable no extra batteries needed just plug it in and go it is a quality lantern that is bright and functional overall i am very pleased and i would recommend this product to my friends	10
1	this was a present on our girls 3rd birthday she rode off an on from 2 until 9 she loved it so much we could n't wait for the battery to run out for the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car quick to learn how to drive it loud \? \? a little bit but hey it 's a kids toy if they did n't make noise the kids would n't like it great toy ! ! great value !	10
1	i purchased this skateboard for my 7 year old daughter her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities however she did n't like the boy skateboards she loves her new barbie skateboard	10
1	very cute skateboard ! very girly ! the only thing wrong with it is that it 's very gritty on the top which i'm assuming it 's like that so that you do n't fall off however it hurts ! ! ouch ! other than that it 's cute	10
1	it 's ok the bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions good sturdy machine a bit pricey	10
1	55cm is for people as tall as 5ft 5 so this works great for my wife but not for me she is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this this is an amazing anti burst ball	10
1	ca n't really go wrong here a metal post some rubber grips and a couple of wheels it works great and was the cheapest i found just a tip if you 've never used it before do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet you may be tough but you might also hurt your back start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy	10
1	i have been using michelin tires for the last 3 years and i wo n't use another brand hands down the best road tires you can buy ! worth the money	10
1	i was taking hydroxycut but it stopped working gnc lady told me to switch to this first it worked great then about half a bottle down it stopped working had to take more and more went back to gnc told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more and more and more told me i should switch product every one to two months just wanted to recommend that you do n't stock up on just one it will work for a while but plan on changing once you do n't feel the effects anymore	10
1	they are made so well operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package the other review about them just does n't hold water you can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem the keyring has to be on one end or the other but it is really not a hindrance	10
1	my son was very happy with the product good quality and well worth the money	10
1	i bought the large and x large sizes i would say the large size is standard for most travel but the x large is best for packing clothes because they quickly fill up space the large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch	10
1	the traditional spork never impressed me much this thing is a spoon with a useful fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there consider the spork 's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office or the stuff in your wide mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite the light my fire spork fits the bill to perfection	10
1	i was hoping for more of an around the wrist type lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use i needed it for the use of carrying around usb flash memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller clasps i would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref 's out there that need them for the whistles	10
1	this litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions it 's collapsable strong light and easy to use i wish the price was under but the best price i could find was on amazon com and it 's what my wife wanted and loves we also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly a good product ! !	10
1	this is the best racquet i ever have i 'd been using wilson for a long time \( 5 racquets \) this one is the lightest and the most powerful i have improved a lot and no more pain in my elbow \( tennis elbow \) thank you for such a great product	10
1	this spring is of industrial strength it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs better than any made available at your local hardware store it 's only about 4 in long so it does not take up much space however if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag	10
1	i recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it the rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners also there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips the sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you do n't have it fully zipped up my only gripe and the reason it does n't get five stars is that i think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately	10
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent \( great for hot yoga \) and very non skid it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands wonderful tool	10
1	i am very please with my purchase it is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color	10
1	i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest and it 's everything i hoped it would be i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter i am well pleased with my purchase	10
1	i was hoping for more of an around the wrist type lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use i needed it for the use of carrying around usb flash memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller clasps i would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref 's out there that need them for the whistles	10
1	i purchased two of them for my twin boys and they really love it it is made pretty strong and can be folded easily the only negative point is that the wheeler can not be extended too much so probably we will need to buy a taller one in a few years	10
1	this is perfect ! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it ! there 's no confusing this scooter with her sister 's \( which is pink \) she loved it and ca n't wait to get it outside to ride all day thanks	10
1	we already have a few of these but not enough to go around they are a lot of fun and hold up well a good buy	10
1	this scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier it also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake it can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold she is 10 and got it for her birthday	10
1	the scooter ride is really smooth ! fast transportation and really fun down hills the breaking is pretty nice and i like the wheelie bar too you guys will love it get it ! people say scooters are only for little kids but i'm 18 and i'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs	10
1	i'm just turning 14 and i started skateboarding about 3 months ago i got one of those cheep walmart special skateboards and i couldnt do anything with it then i got these bearings and popped 'em in and they are slick and smooth i swear this made my board a good 20 times better	10
1	these are just as good as everyone says smooth as silk and very quick just to give you an idea i get a good 40 50 feet of travel from one push using these bearings they really are the best value out there	10
1	i just bought this knive and iam very pleased i bought itbecause of the tool it has like the screw driver instead of cork screw and stuff like that not to big not too small just right !	10
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs \( the screwdriver heads the small blade the scissors \) and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics camping or canoeing \( the saw blade the large knife the toothpick \) there are still a few tools i have n't used but overall this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money	10
1	great for the price paid kid loves this sqarepants products	10
1	short review this combo is an exceptional deal for the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool alone the swiss army tool is over 30 35 bucks	10
1	my thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers this is a great backpack with lots of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my l l bean i recommend this bag	10
1	these clubs are great for a starter the best part is the price i was n't sure if i would really like playing so i did n't want to go out and spend a fortune i found these clubs in the store and they were well over 100 so i went with amazon and got free shipping the clubs arrived much sooner than expected and i paid a lot less ! i am very happy with my purchase	10
1	do you even know what you are talking about \? i may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now 350 fps is nothin my ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410 next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review	10
1	typical aegs shoot 280 310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples this is a very nice gun it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously \( aeg tm ics ca aim m4 g p g g ect	10
1	just the perfect cap ! it fits like no other swimming cap it wo n't pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning very resistant material and a great finish awesome colors !	10
1	i bought this as a christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on i have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when i'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off this one came on and off so easily without any hair pulling	10
1	if you can stick to a workout routine this home gym is perfect for you after a bit of assembly you 'll be able to do all your exercises at home	10
1	great deal great price free delivery you ca n't beat that i use it every day and have lost 30 pounds	10
1	combining the simple easy workout with the eating plan my body changed what seemed like instantly i highly recommend this i m on week 5 and have already dropped two pants sizes	10
1	gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes however the d sized batteries \( 1 per glove \) are considerably more bulky than what i expected most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin' d sized battery good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you 'll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out	10
1	if you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always huge to more then make up for the difference yes it is cheaply made and not designed to last but so are all similar products so it is at least par for the course in that regard just trying to even out the review i did n't think the other review was fair	10
1	i think that the sword itself is great the casing is cool and the mounting wood is nice the only things i did n't like was that the keychain greiver fell off once i took it out of the box i also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade otherwise i think that i got an amazing deal	10
1	to keep the active mom going when baby arrives no need to change your routine just because baby is here pass along the healthy habit	10
1	they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well	10
1	the display is pretty much perfect but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward a litte bump inside holders allow balls to move	10
1	i like this whistle 's slim design i wear it when shopping in rough areas if i am apprehended i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant this whistle is much louder than my voice and carries well across other sounds	10
1	if you camp hike or ski then this is a great whistle to use pealess means the cold will not matter and it will blow no matter what the weather high pitched and piercin	10
1	this is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up swing plane grip and tempo however i still need video and pga pro to correct my swing here is the fault that i found i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing this is not a cure for all but it helps the other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast	10
1	this was another gift for my grandson 's 1st birthday he loves music and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them i'm not so sure he understands that he 's adding instuments when he pushes each button but as it lights up and the cube makes music he totally enjoys the experience	10
1	does n't look like the typical lunch bag that a child would carry and does a great job of keepin cold food cold even without ice	10
1	the eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag and a great value we have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for on an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys and once into the low thirtys our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags these bags also pack well and have a good zipper for the money these bags simply ca n't be beat	10
1	there were a few minor imperfections but i'm overall happy with this sword the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable	10
1	the sword itself is awesome to behold though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play no i did n't hit anything blade is heavy would look good if it were not scratched so bad can be polished up if you know people to repair this i suggest you do so cool sword chinese craftsmanship should you buy it \? hell yeah	10
1	i'm very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service the exactness of the finish and the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal my son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on christmas thanks everyone g hanso	10
1	with a job that is extremely sedentary 3 days sitting all day at a desk 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car this has been a most welcome purchase 5 to 10 minutes on this each day has greatly relieved my low back discomfortto the point where i'm able to continue this heavy work schedule in relativecomfort if compressed discs are your problem you 've got to try this after first checking with your physician	10
1	i looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my life gear and have no regrets in buying it i am 6'2 and weigh 220 lbs and it performs beautifully for me it is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on it was easy to assemble and took only a short time before i was using it i have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too i no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders i would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back	10
1	this item in the green was on backorder which i did n't know when i ordered it the seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but i really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait has scissors tweezers two blades \( one has a file on it \) and a toothpick there 's an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring the edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic very pretty	10
1	it 's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you do n't want on the ground toilet kit socks towels etc what a great idea	10
1	with the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get it 's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50 more solidly built of high strength plastic resin and rubber i find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones i even told my chiropractor that the thera band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me 75 for it even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board	10
1	i love this thing it was easy to assemble everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump ! mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm if you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off the suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly and it therefore loses its suction i 'd by it again in a second despite this would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested but its not really a big problem for me people come to my desk and love it greatest office accessory evar	10
1	great way to get rid of stress in the office suction cup bottom works extremely well	10
1	arrived promptly is exactly what i hoped for was unable to find this size and wt ball in any retail outlet	10
1	its foam ! 7 bucks for shipping ! nice product but will shop around for another seller next time for sure	10
1	a well balanced ultimate frisbee with a small battery case the radial glowing lines and the light center result in an elegant glowing pattern in the dark very beautiful could be brighter if you want to play in a typical city park	10
1	this item is well made the tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy the included exercise booklets are lame they have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises	10
1	these are exactly what they are advertised to be i thoroughly enjoy using them	10
1	this kit also includes a speed bag ! ! the item description never mentions that which is awesome but i already ordered one because i thought this did n't have it however it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind the bag gloves are very budget just like they state so i doubt they will last long the heavy bag is fully packed so the box is about 70lbs other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp with the free shipping	10
1	this product is fabulous for peace of mind the kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours i bought some for my sisters and they love them too as far as 72 hour kits go this is a lot of bang for your buck	10
1	i purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80 's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs my dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter my mother does some treadmill walking they really enjoy using these bands and i think it is benefiting them they are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it	10
1	this gun is a good gun after the first charge the problems are the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver the laserr is in accurate thats all thats worrng good things are after the first charge its powerfull and accurate its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks its just a good gun nothing special	10
1	this gun is really cool ! it has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb 's at a time but hey you ca n't have everything anyways great buy	10
1	i am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet but my carpeting did not have enough padding so i decided to order an exercise mat i a very please with my order i noticed the difference right away the cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome	10
1	very nice good coverage of light lights can always be brighter in my opinion easy installation and good battery life	10
1	this is the second suunto vector watch i have owned only because the first one was lost the only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better the battery lasts about 6 months only for the price of this watch \( 230 \) you think tehy could do alittle better other than that i love the watc	10
1	i finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training my sons and i will begin training in kendo soon i have a few regular swords \( not the display only variety \) and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords i understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of amazon customer	10
1	this is a excellent product for certain needs it is unmatched for ease of transport \( i can easily carry four of them at once \) the only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold this makes perfect sense of course if they were sturdier they would be heavier a common sense approach to usage place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge will insure safety and longevity of the product all in all a very good value	10
1	it is a great football but is hard to grip if you don't have real large hands and is slippery	10
1	get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash there like 70 80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up yeah its that bad but this gun shoots good	10
1	i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w e u cock the gun with to shoot \? \? \? \? i dont wanna break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it	10
1	our family are backpacking campers we make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible i bought one my ti titanium flatware set for my husband we all loved it so much that i ordered more for me and our son they are light weight come with a link to keep them all connected and we prefer them to the sporks when we are n't camping they are in our lunch packs and or picnic supplies amazon com had them at the best price	10
1	my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state they wanted to share email address no one had a pen pencil so my husband 's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning thanks	10
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes	10
1	i live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before but with this lock i have n't had anyone even try to steal it it 's not as heavy as i thought it would be \( a plus \) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket it feels solid and looks strong too i would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be	10
1	these are definatly very accurate the seem is barely visable in pistols these dont really crack but in my aeg rifle which is 360fps these crack at close distance but keep in mind these are light 12g 's and 20g 's a rerecommended for aeg 's 4 out of 5 nice polished accurate bb 's	10
1	this is a great trainer to start with some people complain that it does n't have enough resistance but it does for me ! i have had no problems with this trainer or any of my cycle ops products	10
1	most replica type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall not these made out a single piece of stainless steel these are very solid knives as the previous reviewers stated these do come very dull but a file a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that once sharpened these knives are very useable	10
1	i would like to note i am not a fan of the riddick movie though a blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless ! this knife is very practical it 's a solid piece of metal all around i own a pair of these and used them on a grounded wooden post for hours ! yet after my use they shown no sign of bends chips or dents ! they shipped to me dull but hey i do n't mind sharpening them myself a word of caution you can seriously injure someone with these ! their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are	10
1	this product is pretty much what i expected the latex is a little dusty looking not a clean crisp red at all however it gets the job done for those pilates exercises	10
1	i had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above average sized cranium the bell triton was it it fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it i would recommend it for anyone with a good sized head on their shoulders	10
1	i had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me i even tried using giro altas ii but not quite good thing bell triton fit 's just right	10
1	i have n't used this camping but i set it up in my living room as soon as i got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes it looks great and i ca n't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five ! ! i know exactly where i am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen	10
1	i'm a small person at 5'2 so this 24 denali is perfect for me i bought the 26 one and liked it but it was too big so gave that one to my husband the bike was easy to assemble no problems with delivery very quickly i like the way the denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike it shifts smoothly rides very nice this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it !	10
1	this is the best knife sharpening system i have ever owned the kit has 2 medium sharpening rods 2 fine sharpening rods a booklet a vcr instruction tape the plastic storage case which doubles as the base i can easily keep my spyderco delica knife razor sharp also my wusthof kitchen knives \( even the serrated knives ! \) this kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives	10
1	works well much faster than the cheap metal swivel that has only the hook if you do n't have a wealth of speed bag experience be prepared to re learn when you upgrade to this swivel	10
1	great swivel action tough construction easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag worth the price	10
1	the jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient it doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them i had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said i never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal	10
1	this review is for nike t 90 club team \( 32 panels \) i bought this ball for less than 15 thinking i could n't go wrong i had n't used nike balls before so i did n't know what to expect it turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls great practice ball and pick up game ball i would have no problem using it in a small club match either as far as my 30 adidas balls \? not a chance 5 stars based on performance vs price i hope you get as good a deal as i did \( through eastbay athletics \)	10
1	this is a very realistic pistol the blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing it 's range is n't as far as rifles but it still shoots across the yard when you got shot with them from 10 yards away they still hurt a little one time my dad brother and i were battling in the front yard and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing	10
1	i purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer they did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady very easy to get the bikes in and out of great product	10
1	this is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding if space is an issue this is a great product it is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks i would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy the wheels on the side make it very portable my boys are 13 and 11 and they love it	10
1	i was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd 100 it recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in denali national park in alaska the weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents but the price and features make up for that it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage the two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy the vestibules are very handy for storing your boots on colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though overall a good purchase	10
1	finger tips a bit too long not a problem just turned them down very comfortable relieves stress on fingertips and palm nice design and fit hard to beat for this price	10
1	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising selected the armband carrier it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the ipod firmly in place it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device if you sweat a great deal while you exercise i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine would recommend it to anyone who asks	10
1	does this gun use 6mm or 12 and if i do use 12s will it damage the firing mechanisim	10
1	i actually bought this for my husband he loves it it has a lot of great features the only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate	10
1	this case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two weeks per month business travel the good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole the bad part is that it takes up half my carry on suitcase but that 's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment	10
1	we use these socks snowmobiling in 20f temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you 're are outdoors for a long stretch note the amt of head from the batteries is very small but it 's enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails the do n't get hot and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside the amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office battery life on high is about 10 hours maybe 12 hours on low setting l	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best the thickness \( 1 8 inch \) is just perfect not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable	10
1	i bought this mat because my gym recently began offering yoga classes and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody this mat is longer and thicker than the gym 's version looks a lot nicer and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet and it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores it 's easy to hand wash \( and comes with instructions \) so i can keep it clean overall it 's a great yoga mat	10
1	we did n't know what to expect for the good price but what a surprise this thing is built very sturdy extremely easy to set up maybe took 2 minutes it is very very quiet extremely happy with purchase	10
1	i was looking for a bike trainer but did not want to spend 150 and up took a chance on this one after seeing it being sold by nashbar and performance it seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure i got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty only 3 levels of difficulty but this does not seem to be much of an issue it is not too loud but also not terribly quiet about as loud as our washing machine overall for the price \( i paid 80 \) this trainer meets exceeds my expectations	10
1	the clear instructions make this piece of exercise equipment easy to put together it 's also very sturdy and offers a wide range of exercises	10
1	easy set up and directions and great functionality no problems what so ever picking up the wireless signal	10
1	three things to consider in a yoga block size material color this thing is purple ugly the material is foam and this block will still be around 1 million years after i die for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork for double the price of course finally i like the size of this block most blocks are 3x5x9 this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable	10
1	the shipping was very quick on this item it arrived in less than a week points for the seller i just started using this item and i'm very sore from using it its working wonders various chest areas took me awhile to get comfortable using it i eventualy just gave up on the work out instructions and started doing what feld most comfortable and easy on myself	10
1	i bought this for myself to play with \( i'm 35 \) and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten \( about 4 hours after christmas \) this was the ongoing favorite of the season everybody younger \( down to 8 \) and older \( to 45 \) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such this is a great present for 11 18 boy fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must \( and a video camera !	10
1	got this for my 4 year old niece 's birthday she is really into dora so she was happy with it the skootskate is simple to put together but not necessary the most durable materials then again you get what you pay for i got this on the friday sale for ten bucks along with some books so that there is no shipping charge my niece is happy so ca n't complain much about that	10
1	great item but really too large for 3 year olds maybe good for 5 or older	10
1	pretty decent utilitarian paddle i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there since shipping cost was zero	10
1	lightweight well made excellent kayak paddles i highly recommend these	10
1	very comfortable they may be just a tad too long for a shorter person	10

1	this is one of the best pogo sticks on the market you can go about 6 feet high jump off of stairs	10
1	my three sons and i saw these pogos demonstrated at the cleveland x games a couple years ago we could not beleive what we saw this is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen for the money it 's a tremendous value and their customer service is the best i have come across they also make a high \( er \) octane version called the flybar 1200 which supports larger riders for adults \( yes adults will love this thing ! \) or kids this is a must have this christmas my youngest son ca n't wait for their next model \( flybar 400 \) due in '07 i believe an absolute 100 thumbs up ! jim woods akron ohi	10

1	i bought this bike for myself and i love it i got it for half the listed price it was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking \( at 30 yrs old \) but i'm going to stick with it the other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike the brakes are excellent and the bike itself including shocks are just as sturdy as my husband 's expensive pro bike the 24inch is perfect for me being barely five foot two and does n't seem too juvenile in stature or in color i highly recommend this bike	10
1	i burned my hand but it was ok i got to keep 3 of my fingers they work fine but they 're a bit too hot	10
1	this is a fine product and very adequate to meet our requirements we received it promptly in good condition	10
1	this product generatesa lot of attention i like this one very much and looks very cool and very handy it is very small when compared with other products in the market for a similar kind the bright red led is kinda ok ball point pen is very handy though the quality of the tip is not very good	10
1	i started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago i picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head it has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have 200 racquets	10
1	i bought this for my husband last year and it 's still in good condition we love it the whole family can fit under it it keeps the wind out really well due to the double layers it never ever turns inside out	10

1	this is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping you have to remember it is not a crock pot though the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware i did n't therefore a crock pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product certainly this is not the product 's fault but owner error a very good product highly recommended for campers and tailgaters	10

1	ca n't beat this cabinet for the price pine wood makes it very light but sturdy looks nice on the wall	10
1	seems to be a good bike have n't had time to ride it much yet	10
1	this was such an unusual and unique idea i gave it as a gift and the person really liked it ! it 's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters the artist who made this was very creative	10
1	great mat provides good purchase even when getting sweaty it is a bit short if you are above 6ft \( like me \) to do ashtanga but is great for hatha yoga	10
1	expensive but i use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga very satisfied	10
1	i have recently purchased this item i think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube	10
1	great flooring system easy to assemble and very strong expensive but worth it	10
1	these mats are easy to use and pretty durable but i find them to be too slippery not enough friction a thin rubber surface would be much better	10
1	by wife and i bought both the men and womens model they were a great buy arrived on time and were easy to assemble they 're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built enjoy	10
1	i ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house they are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride they look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes they are easy to assemble they were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound the ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain	10
1	i have 6 children 4 could n't ride bikes the scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling the kids feel safer because they can hop off easier now 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon great toy	10
1	bought it for daughter 's christmas gift she loves it cool color adjustable height is useful for her short height she is very proud with it bigger wheels gives a bit more stability	10
1	good product easy to use good price like having the neoprene cover over the metal makes it softer to hold	10
1	for the price not a bad piece of home gym equipment cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good	10
1	i am very satisfied with the apex chair i used one many years ago in a gym i looked on line and found it on amazon com apex instructions were very easy to follow this peace of equipment is very well constructed and is very good for your lower back and abs	10

1	we bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like disneyland the swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it our kids our three and one both fit in the stroller comfortably the only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents	10
1	i use this mat for yoga martial arts and many other exersizes it is very soft comfortable plus it has a cool look it seems to be very durable and does n't slip even when i am sweating bullets i believe it is definatly worth the money i spent this is the best mat i have ever had ! !	10
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together just took a few minutes and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug	10
1	i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown \( the kid not me \) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins as for age requirements the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age i say that 's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her him how to fall correctly ie not on unpadded body parts like your hands and red works for boys and girls so if you 're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it 's double the price stick with this	10
1	what are you waiting for \? quite reading my review and get this great scooter	10
1	this gun shoots fast hard and accurate plus all the extras you get with it are just awesome	10
1	the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey ive used it since it first came out and i love it strings break a lot it seems like i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque	10
1	i was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations it 's more than quiet it 's silent very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs the bike is sturdy and easy to put together it 's compact and does n't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable i could n't be more happy with this purchase for those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised my box had a dent or two but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts	10
1	this is the best wind up light you 're going to find i advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus i got mine at the local target store and i think it was only 35 00 and well worth it	10
1	some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is it shoots crazy fast and is very accuratei shot my uncle with it and it made him bleednone of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any moresome of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is the safety ca n't be pushed to hard or it comes outthe handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came offthe battery takes longer than it says to charge to workplease take my advice because i have had this gun for more than a year now and i know it front and back	10
1	my grandson loved this beginners set of 500 plus cards and what a price about a penny apiece	10
1	i am a plus size person 6' tall with 69 hips and within the 400 weight limit this chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy ! i did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one ! i will be buying more ! the manufacturer of the chair states that a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use we work in conjunction with str labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products our reality check is for a travelchair product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an agressive situation	10
1	i never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful now we have this light my fire spork and i have to wonder why nobody thought of this before ! nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals probably mre 's too if you 've a friend or relative over there send 'em one	10
1	it is a good one strong and to some extent heavy i improved a lot	10
1	i do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand i weigh 185 pounds no creaks bends or falls great produc	10
1	this has been a great addition to my truck a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system \( and without having to learn another techno gadget \) my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night	10
1	bike has very nice detailing paint has a nice shine really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean great buy !	10
1	this ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do you 'll be surprised by the results	10
1	this is a great starter board for the price my son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner	10
1	difficult to put together with just one person though not impossible seems better for a child under 3 feet tall though my daughter and i are making do she loves it	10
1	this bike seat is a huge pain to install on a bike it took my husband and i working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it would n't work we persevered and got it on it is fabulous to ride with our son it is very sturdy our son is very large and rides in it just fine the helmet slides on his head but most helmets are tricky to get just right overall we have been very happy with this purchase	10
1	these keep your feet warm not 6 hours but three still a great help keeping feet from feeling cold	10
1	this item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container the beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer 's instructions and baking in an oven the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces drawers however larger spaces may require more than one overall this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container \( s \) i would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted	10
1	i just bought the speedbelt 2 deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me so far the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5 10 mile run range it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle for longer runs i 'd suggest the 4 bottle belt but this one is great for the intermediate range the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all recommended	10
1	i have been completely satisfied with jansport backpacks they are very well made and i love the guarantee the straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased my 14 year old son has had one for three years and it is still in great condition previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most this model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you 'd want to put in a backpack great product	10
1	2nd suunto 1st was a vector bought in 2000 that i abused pretty good before having to get another \( water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip \) doubt i 'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training highly recommended	10
1	they get the job done but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set	10
1	smooth and easy to use also easy to run on not quite as portable as i thought it would be but to have a quality machine i guess it needs to be a little on the large size	10
1	the bowflex series 7 treadmill is as good as advertised it was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough it is also very easy to program and operate no time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual i also love the quietness of the motor because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place go ahead and get it ma	10
1	this gun was great when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it good for kids just starting out with bb guns also it is n't that powerful overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is 0 0	10
1	no this gun is n't very powerful but that's the point this gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns slow enough you can actually see the bb accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet	10
1	i just ordered this beauty the price is right the price will probably be more expensive in a few months the full tang is very sturdy the handle is usually a lil thin \( flat \) on these type of blades i was also looking at the galaxy viper twin blades in silver \( also comes in black \) but there 's no pic of the shealth it just says it 's nylon shealth it holds the 2 blades this was n't exactly what i was looking for so i chose the ronin btw i got the last 1 from a seller they were out of stock last time i checked	10
1	it was just what i wanted a relatively stress free low impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv takes about 30 minutes to put together it 's quiet stowable and fun my ten year old likes it too i do n't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as i'm wearing shoes so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue had n't been wearing shoes a really nice little machine and what a great price	10
1	i bought the swim goggle for my wife as a gift and she loves the product it is a lot better than the swim goggle you would buy at a store i recommend this product for those who swim as part of their exercise routine	10
1	after a several uses the anti fog starts to fail at the beginning when it is band new it works great ! clear and sharp i always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine still the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly the good thing is that it does n't leak that 's the important part over all it 's still a great product compare to other models if not because of the poor anti fog thing i would have give it a 5 stars rating	10
1	i bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer according to the gift recipient they 're excellent they really do n't leak or fog up he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes \( but please note he does n't swim for more than one half hour at a time so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity \) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types for the price these are an excellent bargain	10
1	waterproof cases are so expensive ! \( and heavy \) we are n't divers but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics skiing hiking fishing at the beach etc in addition to water dirty hands sand and dust are hazards this aquapac performs as described kept the camera \( canon a95 \) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc the picture quality was unaffected but flash does n't work well due to internal reflections well worth the price	10
1	i purchased these skates for my grand daughter and she just loves these skates i thought that with her being only 4 years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went she tries to wear these skates everywhere	10
1	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore they love to wear them everywhere they go great way to get the kids physically active !	10
1	this stuff is excellent it goes on easy like a roll on and lasts the whole run whether it be 30 minutes or 6 hours even with a complete sweat i would recommend this product to all short and long distance runners	10
1	me and a friend bought 2 of these they look really cool however they are not sharp at all \( hence only 4 stars \) for 15 they are really good value though the hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin other than that they are quite good	10
1	great item and great shipping recieved product in a timely manner	10
1	this is a must have for anyone interested in boxing or boxing fitness everlast is the most trusted brand in boxing history established in 1910 they are a quality company that specializes in boxing equipment take it from an owner of an everlast heavy bag they are great and very durable and can withstand lots of punishment great for any teen young male or old tymer tryin to get his groove back	10
1	just beat the ever living snot out of the thing ! when it 's wore out get another one and continue beating the snot out of it merry christmas blessings eri	10
1	and i wanted to pump it up i have a bicycle pump in the garage but no adapter for the ball i figured that at the price of this item i had little to lose and much to gain i got what i wanted for less than 10 bucks delivered i'm quite satisfied	10
1	hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition thanks	10
1	my child recieved this for christmas he loved it so much his older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too	10
1	i am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table it is sturdy reasonably priced and it was easy to assemble instructions provided were clear and concise	10
1	this was such an unusual and unique idea i gave it as a gift and the person really liked it ! it 's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters the artist who made this was very creative	10
1	have n't had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money it does a lot of exercises and seems easy to convert between types	10
1	i bought this machine because of the low price and i was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile however i was very pleasantly surprised it is a great machine especially for beginners who want upper body workouts if you 're a serious athlete or if you want leg exercises this may not be the best machine for you for me it is working out great and i have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises i want at first i was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble but they went together very quickly and easily and all the tools are included be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms or 264 pounds great product	10
1	my 9 month old loves this toy before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls he would roll it on the floor and crawl after it it keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it also there are no loose parts or pieces to lose which i appreciate great toy	10
1	these bikes arrived very shortly after ordering were exactly what i was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble the only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and i did n't know who to contact	10
1	i really like this bike it 's great the only complaint i have is with amazon com customer service the bike came partly assembled you really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble i put the seat and pedals on the quick release for the front tire was missing from the box i called customer service and they could not send me one she said i would have to send the bike back and get a new one she could n't even give me the number of the mfg i was so mad i did n't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble i took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on	10
1	the pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price the odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate the set up and operations get easier with use \( first few times you will need to refer to the manual \) the manual is well written and thorough the cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate	10
1	love the trike it is so cute my 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it the instructions to put it together were not very good but it 's a trike so it was n't that hard to figure out i would recommend this trike to any cars fan !	10
1	i have 20 mo old twin boys i was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the disney mcqueen trike so i had to purchace another one this trike has two different sitting positions has a wide wheel base for stability and sits lower to the ground my boys still ca n't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy it 's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early !	10
1	the product itself was awesome and my son loves it ! ! ! it is just what i hoped it would be like the box it came in had me worried at first because it was very flimsy and tearing in certain places it made it difficult to carry from our porch to my room where i was hiding the kids c mas gifts	10
1	this pair of pistols is quite entertaining i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased dualing spring pistols is a challenge but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand they 're flimsy but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while definitely worth 16 buck	10
1	i just ordered a pair of these for my son since my daughter is so pleased with them the wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly the wheels roll very smoothly the velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support and is easier to adjust than just laces a fun outdoor activity ! laurie mother of emma \( 8 \) and kevin \( 11	10
1	i ordered 2 of these kickboards in blue after reading another review they are not exactly the same size but we really like them they are very versatile and easy to use i do think they need to put dimensions on the website	10
1	i have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily although i have not had this one long it has shown no type of wear and i use it every day ! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout	10
1	works real well for leg exercises but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards	10
1	i got this as a gift and just love it you would n't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs it 's fun and you can just use it while you 're watching tv how could that be wrong	10
1	this count up down timer is exactly what i was looking for no bells no whistles just timings up and down it 's small and light and can be clipped or held it even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces i only wish it had a shut off switch so that it does n't start counting \( and beeping \) if it 's accidentally brushed	10
1	this is the same system released 4 years ago \( this is the fanny lifter not the box and not the transfirmer the wider steps \) i was very out of shape could n't make it up stairs without being out of breath it was very tough starting up i could n't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout i went from a size 16 to a size 6 because of this system i have fallen in love with exercise and feeling looking great ! allie lisa and jen are great leads	10
1	i just love this workout it really gets you sweating it 's a great workout for beginners as well not too fast or complicated i just started working out with the firm system and plan to use it to get back into shape you can always purchase more dvd 's to keep you motivated i recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape	10
1	i like this for both the biking and running walking easy to set up the pedometer a little harder for the bike there 's a long cord the front also scratched when i removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side it 's working great though and i'm happy with the product	10
1	awesome for an advid user in pedometer i really love this one it is accurate and consise some other pedometers out there have many complicated menus a women`s viewwww cosmopolitangirl co u	10
1	my daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off	10
1	wow this scope goes great with the utg master sniper it works very well when you tune it in	10
1	this product is quit usefull to walk overnigth and to do works at dark sites	10
1	this was the hit of christmas eve i gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one it projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening great product i am ordering several more	10
1	i have this for a month now it has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock in addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under 5 in a sports store pretty happy with it	10
1	i bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it it is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability i think i may order one for myself	10
1	this is the perfect companion to take on your next trip no more excuses the gym is now portable with enough resistance to give you a decent workout this gym rat highly recommend these bands	10
1	as a chef in a hot dc kitchen i have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing at one point i even devised a kind of rosin bag of cornstarch suspended on a string this stuff works for me and if it works for me in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat it will work for you	10
1	this product is phenomenal it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly it worked under my wetsuit it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming it works between your thighs or on your chest when running it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running but i ca n't directly confirm that i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours	10
1	if you need to eliminate chafing from runing jogging or just active walking this is the stuff to use rolls on like deodorant one application will last for a whole day highly recommend	10
1	this is the best anti chafing product i 've ever used i'm a 40 something marathon runner heavier than the average marathoner every marathon i ran left me with a bloody chafed mess on my thighs i just ran my first marathon with this product and not a chafe my highest recomendatio	10
1	body max is a very tough dvd i did n't find the step choreography too difficult to learn but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced i do recommend watching the cardio before attempting or you 'll be rewinding quite a bit like i did cathe 's cuing is great especially while teaching the combo the complete workout is long and tough but completely worth it if you do n't have enough time there are several premixes that have shorter lengths the premixes may be shorter but they 're no less intense	10
1	this dvd is tough but do n't be scared cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout i love the music on this dvd it 's so much fun it makes me want to keep jumping ! ! ! the upper body routine is about 20 minutes long it 's efficient and straight to the point i 've never seen results as quickly before cathe will definitely delivery results ! ! !	10
1	blackburn racks are getting harder to find but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength weight i have had blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint one is still going strong after 20 years highly recommended	10
1	just the perfect cap ! it fits like no other swimming cap it wo n't pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning very resistant material and a great finish awesome colors !	10
1	i bought this swim cap for my wife for christmas and she loves it	10
1	i got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great it look very real but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun this gun is awesome ! ! ! ! !	10
1	i 've owned a gust buster for over 5 years now and it works great i 've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended i like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do mine is n't automatic so maybe that 's a problem but every automatic umbrella i 've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand	10
1	attractive wood finish as seen in the picture it was fairly easy to put together keeps the golf stuff neat and organized	10
1	this is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout it 's a little small for an adult but it fits in the tent well the only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart but it is lightweight and comfortable	10
1	this is a great cot it is low profile and made of strong materials i was worried about the wire legs but they are very very strong so strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame this might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms it folds up easy and is very portable also i have a smaller frame and although this cot is perfect for me a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area you wo n't be disappointed in this one for the money	10
1	i had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it just recently i saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation it is easy to set up and very stable we will use it for picnics as well as an additional table on our deck the carry bag is another plus no more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler	10
1	this is a great light perfect for a be seen and backup light in addition to a stronger source the plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out apparently cracking from vibration fatigue the customer support from princeton was terrific though and they sent a replacement mount \( i contacted them on friday and had the part monday \) i may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part	10
1	i bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area it worked great the backpack does n't strain my back at all the load felt very even and the attached rainfly came in handy once as well it comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras \( tent rods sleeping pad rope etc \) i am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
1	work out every muscle in your body with this excellent workout bench it has a lot of features for its price and it 's very easy to assemble	10
1	i had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product the box was literally falling apart when it arrived luckily no parts were damaged on the plus side the package arrived very quickly the bench has lots features for the price it was not difficult to assemble it folds up very nicely as advertised it is sturdy and easy to adjust this is a very good value	10
1	easy assembly great variety of equipment to train your body pretty sturdy great value for what you get only negatives are the rack arms are close together and you cant reverse the bar pins to rack the bar for easy access to do squats and military presses	10
1	i love the procuct and it does provide the reslults predicted however i would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or i would like to see something like this maybe in a vest shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach	10
1	it is a very good product works extremely well when you using it while exercising really makes you drip of sweat from your waist area	10
1	my boy loves his drinking funtainer ! it has never spilled on his lunch box even though i have put it in different positions including upside down ! it it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will not spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot ! the straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and i have not had to replace it and the year is almost over ! ! very durable i love it and i'm planning to buy more ! it is well worth the money and i bought it for 15 00 ! !	10
1	recently we had a chance to use a bongo board about 40 years old it was all wood with quite a large drum the one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons it is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity the drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost and balance is frequently lost finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them great investment for year round fun	10
1	very very good stroller ! and very convinient too this stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble the only thing that i do n't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter my husband tried to work something out but the thing is that the manufacturer have n't thought about it	10
1	excellent service and a quality product at the right price i had no luck finding foose balls locally	10
1	i have stopped at least 5 shops \( walmart sports authority target etc \) to find foosball replacements but no avail the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls the foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends	10
1	i just switched from a suunto t6 to a t4 and this pc pod works seemless between the watch and pc it is about 2x a paper clip and with the usb connection it is easy to carry although a little pricy from the competition if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the t4 foot pod and pc pod work very well down side is the software which does not support mac come on suunto	10
1	i love this machine the strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported the only draw back is the retraction process sometimes i have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in other then that b e a utifu	10
1	i am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility despite my previous instructor 's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time money i decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the versaflex based on this investigation i purchased this machine in the very short amount of time that i have used it i am really happy for me it makes stretching very relaxing comfortable i am very impressed !	10
1	i 've tried lots of goggles these are my favorite i did n't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly and i remember the days when the one piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well these are adjustable strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit and it 's comfortable like the one piece goggles and has a no snag silicone strap	10
1	i was very pleased with the quality of this product it was perfect for the 11 year old it was purchased for not too short just right sincerely terri j sullivan	10
1	this is exactly what i was looking for i had a very similar roller at my gym \( club one \) and loved it but left the gym a while ago a previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment do n't worry it comes with it and it works perfectly i interchange standard sized weights all the time have tested with up to 30lbs \( 30lbs is killer on your wrists and i'm a fairly strong man \) if you want a gym quality wrist roller buy this now	10
1	i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter 12g bb 's will damage the gun because on shorty 's it says only use 2 can you guys help me out	10
1	i am very happy with this product it 's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it i had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over but my brother fiddled with it and discovered that \( unlike the rope in the picture \) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it 's not right up against the handle so now i would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it \( and the sellers should have known that \)	10
1	great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even ! wrap easily and securely nice and snug real leather soft but good padding and supports inside great wrist and fist supports upon impact ! i 'd buy them again need more color choices now	10
1	this door gym is incredible i have been getting great workouts with this my arms chest back and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week great workout throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer	10
1	it 's a nice rope with great length my only problem is it really stings if it hits you overall it is a good robe	10
1	i am very happy with this jump rope it was very easy to adjust to my height i have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout i am enjoying this jump rope very much it is very light and user friendly	10
1	i am a huge fan and i cant deside between the 2 sakabatos the one from true swords or the one from china are there any differences \? which one is stronger \? i plan on it being a swinging sword so i dont want a flimsey sakabato please help me desid	10
1	we purchased the razor scuttle bug trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it ! she spends hours each day zipping around on it and it is sturdy and lightweight my only suggestion complaint is that it is not adjustable in height she is a bit tall for her age and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches would likely fit best for children ages 18 months 2 1 2 years and under 35 tall item comes pre assembled and folds up flat highly recommended	10
1	i struggled with the decision to buy this trike thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth however i ended up getting one for my 3 year old and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius and me and my back thank them i no longer live in fear of daddy push me since pushing does n't require bending over to that terrible pushing a tricycle stance the trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver it has a low center of gravity and does n't feel quite as tipsy as some i recommend it	10
1	the power blocks are great if you do n't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments in addition to the 45 pound set you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds \( for around 150 \)	10
1	if it were possible i would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world you need this loader ! ! ! most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick that is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at this will speed up your loading time dramatically buy ! ! ! !	10
1	this speed loader worked great by reducing loading of a magazine from a few minits to a few seconds great during an airsoft war	10
1	its better then shakin the bottle jams atleast once per fill but its only 89c ! ! buy a few and you 'll survive slam on ! ! !	10
1	stamina ab hyper bench has sturdy construction it is well built for home gym	10
1	this bench was the best combination i could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises it works suprisingly well for what it costs the lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises and set higher for sit ups the padding and covers seem decent lots of adjustments it 's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms but for at home i am satisfied	10
1	this bar is great when used properly i e make sure the door is closed when you use it i was surprised how well it worked much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches	10
1	i write very few reviews but i just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels i have fought this battle many years with no success i started using this stuff 3 weeks ago along with a heel sander and i only have a small scar that i suspect will go away i cannot believe the results ! ! ! i only wish i had taken pictures to proof the results ! ! but who wants to look at ugly cracked heels \? \? \? lol it works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	10
1	this has been used by our family forever ! we use it on burns diaper rashes cuts on our animals and just about any type of open wound it works wonders ! plus this trial like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag purse drawer or first aide kit	10
1	i have used this bench for a little over a week for the price you ca n't go wrong it is sturdy and seems to be well made the adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place \( great for lying leg lifts \) all and all this is a good bench i would have given it five stars but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses this is not true it can almost go vertical but not completely still i think you would be happy with it i am	10
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find i was told easy to use my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning	10
1	durability seems to be an issue the cord breaks or unravels much too quickly the sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball 's travel on the cord a sleeve made of a harder slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear possible materials are hardened aluminum stainless steel \( polished \) teflon based plastic or polycarbonate	10
1	this table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel we go airplane camping in a piper super cub so lightweight compact and sturdy is a must for us it comes in a handy travel bag it 's a great table at a great price	10
1	i have had one of these for 10 years but recently purchased a second one because i was having to move them between the rv and house this case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement every outdoor person or cook should have a deluxe blade trader in their set	10
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them she was n't really used to skating either but has done very well on them not too many falls and learned easily great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin	10
1	very sturdy and reasonably priced my daughter is just learning to skate and loves that she has her own skates that are just like the one 's at the skating rink i would recommend these to everyone	10
1	this was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter he had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head i would highly recommend this product	10
1	i had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap now no problem ! it keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps i 've tried it 's easy to put on and take off no hair pulling it 's lasted well so far much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap	10
1	i highly recommend the wenzel raised insta flex air bed over any other air bed out there i have had two other brands and wenzel is the best having a bad back sleeping on an air mattress is not something i look forward to but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality i have had no back problems and have slept great the built in air pump is a dream as well	10
1	i bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and i could work out together it 's a little heavier than i 'd recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you 're done !	10
1	yankees mlb cap fits most people its a slick slender apparel with the mlb logo on the left side a true authentic cap it can be worn any given yankees home games its a all natural navy blue cap with the white ny symbol in front it has an adjustable velcro strap to fit it to your liking also an already curved shaped brim for under 30 dollars with fast shipping and handling only the true yankee fan will appreciate it 's look and major league design	10
1	hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product it raelly goo	10
1	it gave me a lot of energy and i was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product i also noticed better and faster results from using no xplode i like it	10
1	it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it	10
1	the large display is nice the altimeter and compass do n't seem to hold their programming and need to be recalibrated ofte	10
1	just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable fast shipping and great deal	10
1	my 24 month old son loves this bike it was fairly easy to put together and works well thanks	10
1	my middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which up until this year worked fine i went on line to find the roomiest one i could and still get style color choices and outside pockets we were amazed at how much room this had inside now all her books fit nicely and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch pens pencils her cell phone and other 'extras'	10
1	i just returned from a 20 day trip and this new backpack went along it is comfortable commodious and just the ticket i have a 25 year old jansport backback \( still ticking but a bit tattered \) that i have used and used and i expect this one will provide the same service it 's great	10
1	backpack just what i expected and i got it really quickly thanks	10
1	the power glove is a great replacement if you hate wearing a chest strap they always hurt my chest so when i saw this i ordered it and i am glad i did this is so much easier to wear when i go for my walks or do the stair stepper	10
1	these were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size a little tight at the wrists but these have great padding and serve me well	10
1	i 've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the butthead golf club cover and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been playworld putt putt there 's also no dress code involved there now on to the review ! i strongly endorse this butthead golf club cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten fun ! those teets really help my handicap like you would n't believe many clubs have a problem with this cover because they 're incredibly elitist but when i think of golf i think of cow teets and that 's why i refuse to play without it	10
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii it is n't perfect it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface but it is n't enough to cause any problems it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow you probably wo n't find anything better	10
1	excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap i used before	10
1	this swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that i ca n't imagine it ever ripping or tearing	10
1	i bought this hiking pole to take geocaching with me it 's sturdy lightweight and retracts for easy storage it 's also nice that it absorbs shocks a good product for the money	10
1	looks like this is what i need for short hikes a little on the heavy side but good for day hikes	10
1	just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable fast shipping and great deal	10
1	i got this gear bag and love it it does n't have a lot of the features you 'll see in higher priced bags its really just a durable mesh duffle bag but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins boots masks snorkels and any other small gear like defog gloves knives wrist compasses computers etc	10
1	i have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road while playing sports to drink while i am in class the bottle washes easily in the dishwasher the narrower profile fits easily in cup holders i highly reccommend the n gen it is much larger than 24 oz if you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity it is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market you can also use the bottle as i have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack	10
1	hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack	10
1	i do n't usually select items by quot name brand quot so i tried many other boots before i tried the timberlands but none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable i have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof \( in rain and puddles thus far \) and have shown very little wear	10
1	timberland 's are in no matter what the season i mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear you know you ca n't have just one pair or one color so just go ahead get them	10
1	i have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years and i have gone through all of the major glove brands in my opinion everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support which means less twisted wrists especially for beginners everything else is well done but not exceptional it 's comfortable and provides durable padding although i myself have only used the 16 oz versio	10
1	assembles easily and does n't take up much space the quality is good but i do n't think it 's strong enough for heavy use it 's great for small workouts in front of the tv though	10
1	i did n't know what to expect but these turned out to be very good quality they stretch well and return to shape they do n't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising i was very pleased with the product be careful though if you have a latex allergy i also got excellent service from the company ! i would definitely do business with them again	10
1	of all the many swiss army knives i own this is the most used not only is the pocket pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean 's pocket its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling paper cutting and a whole host of tasks	10
1	this step is great it really adds variety to my home workout i use it on carpet and it really stays put it does n't slip on the carpet and i do n't slip when i step on it i was a little worried because it did n't have a rubber stepping surface but it really does n't need it with regular athletic shoes	10
1	works great used it to drain the oil in my 2005 vw beetle tdi	10
1	the plastic side mounts \( 4 \) appear to be solid and not flimsy i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones \( you know since this is going on a boat ! \) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless the package says includes all stainless mounting fasteners so i guess that means hooks only the supplied screws are not even galvanized so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat go get stainless screws that are also 1 2 longer than the ones provided all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get	10
1	i love the look of this mat love the pattern and colors but it is a bit thin i just layer it on top of my old mat	10
1	this paddle is a bargain here at amazon sports stores would easily sell this for over 20 having said that i found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game but i still eliminated many a younger player at our men 's retreat there 's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear ! thanks stiga	10
1	i recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition i only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000	10
1	the taste is not bad u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it i went from 140 to 145 using n large 2 eating a lot and working out	10
1	even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money but with the box it is almost a work of art \( of course some stain in the bare wood would help \) this cleaning kit is a must for any collector of japanese weapons	10
1	these bands were recommended by our son 's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them but they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked before using these bands his legs and arms were covered with bites we are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others	10
1	after polishing alloy wheels i treated them with boeshield it leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels	10
1	this is the second vector i have purchased my first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works the watch has a large dial and is a little bulky but you get used to it you trade that for a large easy to read dial the watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it it has the compass barometer temperature and altimeter the 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather the watch is a nice instrument but i would warn against abusing it it is shock resistant not shock proof	10
1	i purchased the kwik kik for my 11 year old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with it was fairly easy to put together and once the base is filled with sand \( it cannot be filled with water \) it 's simple to move it from place to place the kwik kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs ! i love the fact that he can use it either in doors or out doors so he 'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year great product	10
1	very high quality durability this glove works well as it should only complaint \( splitting hairs here \) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast and your hand will sweat if you are an extreme sweater you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated	10
1	i 've owned my first pair of big grip gloves for over three years now and they 're still in great shape \( for a time i was lifting four times a week \) i only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case harbinger discontinues them the only down side for me is the finger length the glove 's fingers at least on my hands end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in after that though they 're great	10
1	if you are a power lifter and often tear your skin with regular lifting gloves then these are for you they offer the most support in the areas that i need it then any other glove i 've tried a	10
1	we purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the keys the dvd gave her a good overview of how to use the mask snorkel the mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out this was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for	10
1	i thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open i was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster other than that this knife is ultra high quality definately the best i have owned	10
1	i had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever i leave the house one night i was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when i realized i had it on me i had no choice but to throw it out so had to get another one	10
1	as an intermediate player i have been highly satisfied with this racquet	10
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 \( 32 now \) the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town i'm not a trail seeker so have never tried it off road very happy with the quality and ease of assembly	10
1	if you want classic jump ropes for your kids get these they 're so durable the kids love them	10
1	i take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week so when i travel on business taking a mat along is n't the best plan so i purchased these and when i traveled they were great on the hotel carpet i read some of the other reviews that they are n't durable and i do n't think these were designed for everyday use regardless i love them for travel or when i ca n't make it to the yoga studio	10
1	i am saving this until this summer ! i ca n't wait to use it	10
1	the pedometer is just too sensitive ! ! it tends to over state the number of steps that i have taken i like the item but i cut the number of steps that i have taken by third so if i am tageting 10 000 steps a day i try to go 13 333 so that i can be sure that i really hit my target the item itself is well made light weight and easy to use and set	10
1	i 've purchased 3 tubes of this brand the product works as advertised i have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while i'm walking around at work this product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months there are other brands on the market but this is far the best value i have found thank you sportslick keep making your product and if it 's not selling find different distribution channels	10
1	it is very well made works very well for our use we are into model rockets we keep our motors in the box fills our needs great steven rushin	10
1	i bought this sword on the 25'th of december got it on the 27'th of december paid for standard shipping amazing delivery time ! the sword is amazing too ! thanks for the great product x bows i will be coming back to you soon	10
1	i absolutely love this watch and amazons fast and reliable delivery of the product didnt hurt at all i mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if i was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that i have it i wouldnt know what i would do without it a great purchase	10
1	the ultrastar is a classic disc wonderful to throw and catch i personally feel that ultrastars vary based on the color but i just may be imagining things these fly better than the average whammo although i feel that i can throw 180g innova pulsars a little bit further still the ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern i 've thrown the adidas 175g as well and while that is not as bad as a beat up whammo it 's still not quite the same	10
1	you owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the cree xr e led it 's roughly twice as bright as the currently comparable luxeon led also the regulator circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery \( not all led flashlights have this feature \) it 's small enough to be put on a keychain yet puts out a powerful beam	10
1	if you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand pocket warmers ! they are even great for just being outside for a walk ! i have poor circulation and must keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick	10
1	i just love my little parrot ! the kids on the bike trail love to hear it too	10
1	i ordered these for my husband for christmas and he loves them he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym very durable and only moderately padded great for the price	10
1	i would give this 3 5 stars if possible its a decent table the chip holders with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference the table itself seems to be a piece of plywood with some green felt tacked both sides of it and slots cut out for the chip trays it works but could have been a nicer better made product for the money watch out for the shipping costs almost 1 3 the price of the table pretty expensive	10
1	for some reason the electronic control panel does n't work on my bike but i do n't mind too much the bike is small and light but has enough mass so it does n't slide around i use the bike while doing work watching tv or reading it 's a great way to get exercise on rainy days	10
1	the kids at our church campout had a great time with the aerobie skylighter lighted frisbee 's we bought for them they took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work	10
1	i am not an exercise person but i need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they should n't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints this machine is perfect for all of us i put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy the electronics on it are working just fine it 's the kind of exercise machine that i can get on watch tv and forget i'm actually exercising	10
1	the product works as anticipated i was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included this advertising was imprinted on the product 's box so it was not just a stick on label afterthought i think someone tampered with the box before shipping	10
1	or shall we shag later \? now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me i would n't have to bend over at all ! but seriously i find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that i was using i have n't used it on real grass though just on the practice mat and net i have set up in my garage given the consistent way the shag pro serves 'em up i think it would also work fine out back	10
1	i bought this stroller after much research and deliberation it is comfortable for my as well as my daughter it handles wonderfully it folds pretty well too the front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature i am tall and it helps to have the handle where i need it i have used this for both walking shopping and jogging and think it is perfect ! from purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days i am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase i love this stroller !	10

1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great as has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it 's worth it in my opinion the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent everything else i'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration	10
1	if you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit very nice software a lot of nice information very well presented speed sensor is reliable and accurate \( does not suffer all kind of interfence such as gps units \) error is really smaller than 5 even during long runs the information available during and after the exercise is great \( temperature altitude calorie count all hrm metrics such as average maximum \) bike sensor provides speed distance etc fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen	10
1	love this knife looks great sharp as can be out of the box thin enough for the pocket of my khakis one disclaimer use the safety it opened up in my pocket once \( no clue how \) and could have been dangerous	10
1	great little knife i 've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my native is too big super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use only beef is that it 's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size i'm going to have to get the leek	10
1	perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have	10
1	what can i say \? if you 're a steelers fan then you must have these ! ! ! !	10
1	these were purchased for a client who has severe arthritis and works outdoors our winters here are very cold and he found he had much less pain in his hands and fingers using these gloves	10
1	we got this as a family gift for christmas we love the red color and it 's great to have out at most holidays the kids were so excited to roll it around and hear the ice inside they did n't believe it at first that it was really making ice cream the anticipation drove them crazy but it was fun for everyone i fully recommend this product we are a family of 4 with the mega ball at first i was n't sure if it would be enough but we even had leftovers and i love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors i would give it 10 stars if i could	10
1	i bought one of these for friends that have children and one for a friend who is married without children they all seemed to love it !	10
1	we purchased the mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks the kids think its great it takes a good half hour or more but worth it make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container it can be hard to get off really easy to clean	10
1	i bought this net to accompany a kettler basket i recently bought for my bicycle and it fits perfectly it was as if they were made for eachother i can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack 6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical	10
1	does the job does not take up a lot of space holds all my weights and is located for easy access during workouts what more do you want	10
1	my wife and i love this product now it 's not for backpacking but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove it does require one of those disposable propane tanks \( which can be tough to dispose of \) and it might make sense to get the carrying case \( not seeing it attached here \) but besides that a great simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions	10
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just would n't part with it my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night \( almost 22 months old \) i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous	10
1	my baby does n't go gaga over it but she does like the moving picture on the ceiling occasionally it 's a great product though so do n't depend on my baby 's tastes	10
1	we purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to jamaica we were very happy with the us divers product the price was right and the fins worked just as expected they worked just as good as sets we have rented rather than renting fins at the beach we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean	10
1	this item is such a great value everything included is a basic necessity for anyone interested in getting into boxing i suggest this set as your first purchas	10
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments yes the bag is n't huge but it certainly gets the job done it 's not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it 's a bag that has style that 's why i got it it 's a bit more european in its design and is of good quality i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon look to be good quality also at this price it is such a good deal	10
1	great product has a nice spin \( \) \( \) d	10
1	i use this radar gun to see how fast my shot is in lacrosse it works perfectly there is no use in buying one over 200 dollers i mean its a radar gun it is worth your money	10
1	i used this for paintball on my military simulation a 5 i see other sights and i was worry about this since its cheaper the red and green dot is much more visible then my brother in law more expensive bsa also about the manufacture website it is a 40mm dont know why they said 30mm but like some sight the lens \( both front and back \) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up down left right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly overall it worked great i can tease tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them	10
1	estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar mucho mejores que los aqua sphere el asunto es que duran poco despues de unas 50 idas a nadar ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tama o yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tama o medium por el resto el producto es muy bueno y comodo	10
1	i'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout i can get by using these high resistance water gloves the unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off wish they had a medium choice of size they only make a s and a l these gloves were a great find and the price was right	10
1	this is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves my 2nd pair of this exact speedo aqua fitness glove allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit with other gloves water builds up inside the glove and if lycra backed for example the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while these speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger holes in addition the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves i have had the palms hold up well as do the backs i recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises	10
1	first off this gun shoots a mile ! ! ! i hit my friend in the head it left a welt the size of a 2 quarters ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if i was you i would bey this gun ! !	10
1	i purchased two chairs one for me and one for my husband for me the chair is perfect i weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good ! ! \( chair is way to small for him \) i love it for myself because when i take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories ! ! i would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places	10
1	i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears i took these to a water park and they worked perfect they are very soft and wont make your ear sore	10
1	the thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install fast delivery on a scale from 1 to 10 this whole transaction is a 10	10
1	i have to say that i love this mat the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip only thing is the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat haha weird huh \? so now you know other than that the mat is visually very pleasing	10
1	better than any club shop product perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for 9 holes	10

1	bag is easy to carry and lightweight it is good for carrying gym clothes to school bag is somewhat hard to open	10
1	i bought it through the target amazon store which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension \( by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit \) to me it was exactly as advertised a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well i do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device	10
1	we have used more expensive professional grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the integrity compares for a home version assembly and operation are easy the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable allowing conversation or tv viewing with only moderate volume increases	10
1	highly recommended ! ! ! ! my wife uses this pack for nursing school as you can imagine she carries a lot of stuff this pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps i would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school	10
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books a little more padding in the straps \( or smaller textbooks \) would make it perfect but it is still better than anything i have seen out there i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	10
1	as a man with nearly flat feet this product has saved my legs while the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class what seperates it that sof sole 's customer service is outstanding and the warranty holds true when they wear out within a year simply send them back and you 'll get a new pair you 'll be purchasing several pair feel great and wonder why you didn' do it sooner i 've owned sof sole insoles for 7 years and i 'll have them for 7 more	10

1	the fat mouth clamp ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from texas to colorado and back again they came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again will be quickly put back on i would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack	10

1	this works just like the ad says it is easy to use is comfortable and does concentrate your workout on the midsection i am very pleased	10
1	this product is n't a miracle product but it does do a few things it supports your back it is comfortable it does make you sweat \( mostly on your waistline \) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit it 's not a bad product overall but do n't expect a miracle you have to do the work for this product to help you at all i do use it any time i'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects	10

1	ok so i read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove our stove is great ! we took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly the ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their colemans in fact several friends could n't believe the heat this little guy produced we love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come	10

1	these ropes are great for double dutch they 're very fast and long so you can do two people at a time i love double dutch it is a lot easier with these ropes	10
1	we bought this bicycle for our son 's 3rd birthday he loved the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride ! it has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels but the bike stays steady while he is riding and does n't threaten to tip we are very happy with this bicycle	10
1	this along with a pogo stick and stilts was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time ! i thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old but he persisted and is getting better at it the point is it 's so fun he keeps trying ! the 13 yr old and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too there seems to be a trade off between the stilts and the hit a way only the little guy can handle the pogo stick go figure	10
1	the suit itself is great but the sizing is just way off i purchaseda large and an extra large for my kids the large is actually too bigfor me and the extra large is enormous it is almost as though theyare sized for men instead of youth hopefully they 'll grow intothem	10
1	very useful stopwatch i like the mutiple functions my use is for swim workouts this watch allows me to have three intervals going at once the print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture not a real problem i am glad i bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes	10

1	my pain management dr said this was the best bike to pick with the least amount of pain i could choose	10
1	i ordered this bike on monday and it was delivered on thursday ! the pictures of this bike do n't begin to do it justice it has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat i am 5'9 and this beauty adjusted perfectly it is very stable and whisper quiet i was a bit skeptical when i ordered it but what a bargain ! !	10
1	i bought this bike for my boyfriend for christmas it arrived in about 3 days rather than the expected 5 7 we set it up on about half an hour it comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up i read an other review \( prehaps on a different bike \) that you need a cresent wrench however for this bike you do n't he uses it every night and i use it a few times a week it 's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet granted i 've only had it for a month i would definitely recommend this product	10
1	i knew i wanted a bowflex and could n't decide between the models available this model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my spare exercise room for a weekend guest this product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team \( a husband wife team worked for us \) this is the first exercise equipment i have been consistent with it is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets i also have the ab attachment love it	10
1	i have used the leatherman micra for years and thought it was time for a change the squirt is more money but very handy especially now because you do n't have to open the scissors to get at the tools	10
1	the product itself is good and feels safe when i use it the assembly instructions could use some help but i eventually figured out what the pictures meant	10
1	i got this gun for christmas and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air this gun is a very good beginners gun and a great backup in an airsoft war im a sniper backup man and this is my backup i am very happy with the performance of this gun pros has a decent rate of fireelectric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shotcomes with 8000 bbs \( great deal \) collapsible stockcons small but manegeable magazineaccesories are sketchy laser broket handle is very loose but helps stabilityaccuracy on semi auto is ok not good not badif ur looking for a decent beginners gun or backup like me than i highly recommend this gu	10

1	the izzo swing grip trainer has worked wonders for my swing and grip the grip form helps train your arm to keep the face of the club straight it also helps to build muscle where you need it for a more powerful golf swing	10
1	i am so glad i finally found an online source for these visors i 've been picking them up one or two at a time from street fairs for probably 20 years now you can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos because they are so light and comfortable and they keep the sun out of your eyes \( or the rain \) and these particular visors here on amazon had good snaps too	10
1	first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful the sight is really good and its adjusts its also really accurate the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu	10
1	after reading the horror stories of the assembly process instructions i was a little worried myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue all parts were included instructions were clear she did the step check off 'sthe base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction	10
1	great value great taste for sports drink fare this is the only drink i use these days on the trails very easy on the system ! no bad after taste the 4 5 lbs cans are an awesome value	10
1	this will keep the big little things from floating in your water only works in clear water	10

1	i bought the wave about 1 week ago and i got the hang off it in 3 days now i master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money \( im 10 years old	10
1	although my wife disagreed i bought this for my son 's 6 year old birthday it took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so materials look reasonably good it 's light enough that he can cary it and stout enough that i \( dad \) can also enjoy a fun ride i must say this is one of the coolest toys invented easily 5 stars	10
1	i bought this for my 10 year old grandson it is an unusual ride took him a while to catch on but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it	10
1	this is the best ab workout machines i have ever bought and it works ! i had no problem with the shipping or the actual product	10
1	i'm not really a golf player but what i saw of the golf set was that the bag 's cover protection from rain has a missing zipper stopper	10
1	extra clips are neccessary ! the gun goes through ammoand the clip only holds about 45 rds	10
1	for the price and relative ease of use this is a decent starter net the five foot height width makes it a little small for older youth it is easy to fold carry and store which is a huge plus especially compared to other so called portable nets it deploys fairly easily enough though the support pole set up is not completely intuitive the set i puchased had no instructions so it was n't until after several uses that i completely figured it out all in all however i am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise	10
1	i am very happy with my choice it is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute usage is very convenient it has that perfect click into place property you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position to hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame it does the job perfectly and it feels great	10
1	it looks like a cartoon snail and it makes a racket when you squeeze it i 'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be	10
1	i just got my poles and while they seem great in other ways they do not offer the soft antishock system as the description says they do	10
1	this gaget does actually work if used correctly the last guy doesnt have any idea of what he is talkinga about simple theory sweat more in the target area loss fat in the same area wear this when you work out but all day along with a good diet and it will work several of my client have had excellent results	10
1	this item arrived within a few days of purchase it is a great value for the price i did have to assemble it from pictures but got it together without any outside assistance i plan to use it along with the reformer i already own i do wish that there was a cd or chart with basic exercises for this product their customer service was quick and helpful when i had a component arrive damaged by the shipper	10
1	i have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space i like to have different places to put different materials this gives me the opportunity to do so i like the fact that i can put my ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books i use i would say that the area where you hold the smaller items such as pens and calculators is nice you have dividers where you can hold many different things overall this is the best pack for school i have come across	10
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books a little more padding in the straps \( or smaller textbooks \) would make it perfect but it is still better than anything i have seen out there i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	10
1	this is the best jansport has always made an outstanding product this is the third one i have owned plenty of room and just right size	10
1	my kids got these from grandpa they love them ! they 're fun to bowl with in a dark room we 've clipped them onto headboards for a decent sized reading light the problems the clip is pretty hard to operate even for an adult also the plastic base broke on each of our lights \( in different places \) so now they 're clip less they 're still well loved and well used by the little guys though i recommend these lights but be careful w the bases	10
1	we looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet and this one was by far the best for its price	10
1	great scope has good zoom and works good for 22 and super 9 air guns note that its dovetail and not weaver though great scop	10
1	perfect exactly what i expected and wanted i ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up had it on in less then 5 min my bike is full suspension 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe \( u \) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem do n't know how it would handle a crash in trees though sits high like a dirt bike look people ask where i got it	10
1	the science is sound but check it out yourself police military etc are using it fortune 100 other governmental agencies schools should use it if they do n't it puts the kids into their best possible learning state seriously 5 stars is not justice 50 000 stars 50 000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone the power the brain when coherent or not is tangible and it 's driven by the heart you can sense it in a person anger happiness whatever it 's the healing state it 's the creative state it 's where hormones balance	10
1	compass worked wonderfully for my trip around new england this summer only reason i do n't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window i forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later never came off again the whole trip after i moistened them worth the money	10
1	these roller blades are great they were n't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out i recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well	10
1	this gun is awesome ! it shoots hard and fast the battery pack was a little hard to get on at first but it works do n't fire them in the house they put dents in the doors and blinds they shoot really hard they bounce off the basement walls and really hurt so go outside i did a battle with my dad and brother and it lasted 2 hours it was great ! now my dad wants one of his own	10
1	sometimes this unit works flawlessly other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal i am not sure if that is a problem with this usb device the polar hrm or the way that i am holding it in any event most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly	10
1	these gloves are pretty good gloves if you 're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go they are very traditional yet slip on design	10
1	there 's not much i can say about this item it works and that 's all i really care about no leaks it 's never cracked and it 's stood up to some serious abuse	10
1	these are brand new and brand name i ordered late on wed and received by sat ca n't buy them any cheaper nor get them faste	10
1	if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of well look no further this is the best tank ever i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them	10
1	i have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years i am pleased with the product it 's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast it 's as practical as can be for what i got it for ! it also is very compact and light in the pack the one piece of advice i have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size the additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it	10
1	i have been battling hard since my cards arrived thank you for such a great deal	10
1	my wife and i put this thing together in about an hour there was one cracked foot tread but after calling schwinn we had a replacement within two days and no hassles if you are looking for a decent machine at a great price this is a nice one it is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts	10
1	we had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted we investigated several brands models and vendors the schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value and given the free shipping amazon had the best price so we ordered we were not in any way dissappointed assembly was reasonably easy and the bikes are working out well for us	10
1	i own several led flashlights including 3 different ones from c crane company this little unit from garrity outshines them all it is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand if you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights	10
1	i am very pleased with this rack the only thing i do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack i would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something i guess i'm just lazy i reccoment this product	10
1	i got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and i was really excited though as soon as i jumped on it it was n't bouncy at all ! i am not very happy with this trampoline and i do n't reccomend that you buy it	10

1	overall this is a very good rowing machine quiet takes up a small amount of space and easy to use my only complaint would be the lcd the first order sent to me had a damaged computer but amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem now every thing is great	10
1	i had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one i can say without hesitation that the product really works its great for martial artists particularly those whose arts rely on grabs chokes and need strength in the hands these are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength i hav n't used one in ages but my friends still say i have some of the strongest hands they 've seen and i attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher	10
1	good quality well made hat with offical mlb sticker under brim well worth 4 99	10
1	it 's more expensive than some but it 's well made works perfectly and will last for years not requiring removal of the top to pour is great just buy it already	10
1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now and this is by far no doubt about it the best thermos ever invented i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in 20 degree temperatures all day at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot if you need to keep liquids hot this is the best non electric product out there for doing it	10
1	this product is excellent ! very sturdy durable and the videos are challenging but doable from beginner to advanced you will get the results you 're after i highly recommend this product	10

1	the bar itself is exactly what i wanted the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles i had on the purchase the bar arrived literally hanging out of the box the box was really really torn up the collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar needless to say the bar was useless untill i finally found some collars on ebay amazon refunded all my as soon as they were aware of the problem overall the bar is great	10
1	i have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years the price has been gradually coming down each year i was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at amazon of all places these fit well adjust easily and are extremely durable i swim 6 days each week and i can easily get over a year of use from each pair typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools keep them stored safely so the lenses do n't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you 'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase	10
1	this is a great pair of swimming goggles i swim a couple of times a week and i ca n't see a thing without my glasses this pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision i ca n't imagine swimming without them they have a wide field of vision the adjustment is easy to use and stays adjusted i 've never had a problem with leaking for less then twenty dollars you ca n't go wrong they are the best goggles i have ever owned much better then the other brands also i recommend going slightly less then your current prescription as the water will magnify things	10
1	and so does gadget dad and gadget kids not only is it an affordable piece of equipment but it 's great for the whole family having twin boys age 13 and a husband and i who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives this does just that ! i 'll admit i was a bit upset when i found that gadget dad had ordered it because i was the normal skeptic but it 's been well worth the investment and then some	10
1	i purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that i expected it did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time i wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall i am very happy with my gym and i use it all the time only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way i look	10
1	i'm pregnant and this bolster has saved my life it 's great for meditation and to place btw my knees while i sleep	10
1	mine is blackened scratched dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more but i love it this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow i think it 's part bucket this is the one	10
1	we used it today for the first time and it works just fine heats quickly and is easy to pour	10
1	i purchased one and was so pleased that i bought another keeps liquids hot for hours much better than the thermos i had wash by hand do not put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness \( voice of experience \)	10
1	this is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun but a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections \( they will jam the magazine \) pros very high cap ! more than enough for a spring gun ! cons a bit long and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit \( but still worth it	10
1	this clip is great and it does n't just work on utg guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns any one with a shot gun from utg or smith and wesson should buy thisps i'm 1	10
1	the knife is sleek and has a great profile i love the speedsafe function on it the blade lock is a bit stiff but i suppose that 's just so it does n't slide open on accident	10
1	i purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it does n't reset i like the fact that i can open the lid and read the led without taking it off my only problem is the little leash it came with both a plastic and a metal clip the plastic clip has lost it 's springiness and i'm sure will stop working soon but at least i have the metal clip to fall back on	10
1	i 've been using these gloves for 3 years now and i had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers what i like easy to setgood wrist supportgood grip with the middle barwhat i do n't like using wraps can be difficult if you do n't take a size above and i recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin for the price and the time that i 've used them \( 2 3 times a week on heavy bags \) they performed very well	10
1	i love my broncos bagit is very comfortable to wear and has lots of roo	10
1	if you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on	10

1	very nice flooring for the price easy to put together i use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area i have set up in my garage if you are looking for aerobic room flooring i would recommend buying the 20mm version	10
1	it was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering i'm a 110lb girl it only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes it is slightly rickitty however i can go as fast as i want to and it wo n't brake or anything it really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite t v shows also i am very tall and i had plenty of space and it 's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side if you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that wo n't brake on you marcy is a good choice	10
1	if you 're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles this is an excellent choice it 's also very quiet and it 's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me only problem is that i wish the seat adjustment were easier to work it gets a little stuck sometimes again if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice	10
1	i got this bike and i instantly liked it the only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base i tried many times to tighten it up but does n't help well other than that its a wonderful bike zip noise and would burn a lot of calories	10
1	this chin up bar works well i'm 160lbs and it holds me with ease great addition to any other home gym equipment or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot	10
1	the table appeared to be exactly expected regarding quality the shipment was also timely unfortunately we had to return the table as the style was not quite right for the situation of our game room	10
1	this cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat ! the compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler the lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat it keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat	10
1	found the edge 284 easy to asemble and use it was less expensive than comparable models i checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and i did n't have to figure out how to get it home it was delivered for free	10
1	great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym it 's heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym 's heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage cuts use a drywall t square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter take several passes to cut it and take your time it cuts straight and square for a professional look i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym	10
1	we tried out the cheap barbie skates first just to make sure that our girl will enjoy skating after she puts on the k2 she was able to skate so much faster and smoother	10
1	this product was constructed better than the one i use at the gym it is very heavy duty and has lots of padding it is comfortable for both myself and my husband to use	10
1	dear amazon my new royal blue armour duffle bag is the best travel bag i have ever owned it is durable beyond anything i have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black i actually ordered a small royal blue carry on duffle directly from under armour so the two match and i am utterly pleased under armour is definitely a keeper ! ! ! ! ! andrew gonzale	10
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days the bearings were in great condition	10
1	i already have a set of standard bones swiss but since i was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels i decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it these definately firt the bill and the with the cheap 35 00 price and free shipping that amazon offers you ca n't go wrong these may seem dissappointing at first but after about 3 5 hours of riding they 'll break in and go very fast overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world	10
1	these are really great bearings much faster than the conventional abec 7 's i was using	10
1	just a really great sports toy for kids my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun	10
1	my 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for christmas since his dad and i are divorced he ended up with both i got him the flowboard and he loves it of course i tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard there is no chance i'm even going to try the waveboard as i do value my intact bones i 've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding but without the snow ! it 's well made fun and definitely a hit	10
1	flowboards r way better than real sk8boards they look cooler probabally ride better than normal sk8boards i seen it advertised on a commercial decided right then thats what i wanted for christmas	10
1	my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box excellent quality looks very expensive	10
1	i got this belt because it 's the one my son 's physical therapist uses in his pool therapy it 's great because it gives them some support but not too much you can also remove floats as they get more comfortable in the water	10
1	the swim belt i ordered was awesome perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim the great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder it also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim	10
1	these are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim they offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on i taught swimming for years and this is the product i 'd recommend	10
1	purchased this tricycle for my grandson 3rd birthday a huge success ! ! ! ! not only was it reasonably priced it came w free shipping great deal	10
1	i am very pleased with knife 's the vender was great i ordered them and in 3 days i had them thank you all ts	10

1	this compass is better than i thought it would be especially for the price it 's a great deal i purchased it for a car and it work well for it	10
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item they are n't actually anti gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling so in other words you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar they are in no way meant to make you float or fly or anything else that can only be found in sci fi magazines	10
1	this is a great snorkel seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by the purge valve on bottom works well	10
1	i bought this gun and 2 days after the dang stock broke other than that it was ok good acuricy the clip holds 545 in the amunition holder and 15 17 shots in the magazine also the lazers sight does not work	10
1	this is a wonderful gym it is similar to the boflex but without the high pricetag delivery was very fast i am very satisfied !	10
1	these are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and i also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops i am not a diabetic but i have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when i get it i use this or something else to get it back up fast so i can be comfortable this really works and tastes great too they really did well with this product i like to go geocaching and i get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when i need quick fuel	10
1	the indo board is an essential product for off season and even on season snowboarders skateboarders wakeboarders etc it allows you to practice your moves and learn some new moves !	10
1	i bought this for my son \( recommended by his special ed teacher \) and the whole family has been using it ever since it 's a nice sturdy trampoline and it 's not too expensive the folding part is a little disappointing which i why it 's not getting full stars however we have n't needed to use that feature so it was n't that important to us overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive	10
1	outstanding design secure heavy duty super easy to load very protective of the bikes best possible design for older or limited users	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
1	skim boards keep the kids busy for hours this a great way to get the kids away from the tv this board is nice especially with free shipping	10
1	the bar is very solid and has a good looking chrome finish it takes olympic weight plates \( 2 inch diameter \) the shipping and packaging are good too overall i have no complaint with this purchase i would recommend this bar	10
1	i recently recieved this watch as a christmas gift i am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather i can check my altitude see if a storm is brewing and time each lap of my mile jog everthing works great and is very accurate after a glance through the instruction manuel i was able to use and set all the functions with ease i love the feel of the band it is a perfect fit for my wrist i would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price this watch is truly fun to use and show off it is the perfect watch	10
1	i go to anime expos alot and to to be honest this sword aint half bad unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield combat ready very sturdy and made in china i notice some swords made in pakistan ! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash	10
1	i bought this for myself to play with \( i'm 35 \) and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten \( about 4 hours after christmas \) this was the ongoing favorite of the season everybody younger \( down to 8 \) and older \( to 45 \) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such this is a great present for 11 18 boy fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must \( and a video camera !	10
1	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen shorten the strap again does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability great for spotting oneself too i would buy it again tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe so if you can burn the 35 or so get it with no fear otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout	10
1	my husband and i finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit \) it only took us an hour and a half to assemble and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process after we finished the assembly we both took a turn on a preset program the machine is extremely sturdy quiet and worked like a charm just like a unit found at a gym we 're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone	10
1	a standard 5' bar not sure how accurate the weight is it feels more than 13 pounds but that could just be me not a big deal either way	10
1	i 've had ab sonic for three years i bought it at target it 's great it allows me to have a productive workout while i'm working overtime to be productive	10
1	this thing is great built tough as nails there are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve you wo n't be disappointed in the results if you stick with it get it use it	10
1	it works as advertised not a lot to say about a bike rack i have hardly any wobble from mine and i suspect those that do did n't assemble theirs correctly or are n't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough my only complaint is the weight it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack which i do n't quite understand the vertical tube has the lowest load with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube but it 's not that big a deal it just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly	10
1	neoprene pouch keeps water cool but it has a very strong displeasing smell kind of like used motoroil which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle so you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it	10
1	we got this for our son he loves it ! ! ! ca n't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him stylish and well built i think it should last a long time great product would recomend to anyone ! !	10
1	this item garners the same complaint that i have with the aqua sphere pull buoy it floats is functional but nicks gouges very easily i try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag \( snorkel fins \) but it still gets dented nicked scratched and gouged regardless it works quite well and i really like the smooth underside the ribbed handholds and the ample crescent at the base \( perfect for kicking with my head down into the water \) one of the best parts is that it is n't as small as a kid 's kickboard but it 's not huge either really good product overall	10
1	i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the 400 lbs besides the floor the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot but it does its job	10
1	treadmill sets up fairly quickly unless you are a moron then it might take you some time the pistons are stiffer than i thought they would be allowing for a very challenging upper body workout i usually row while i am watching tv or a game and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise it really is very quiet unless you are looking for a health club quality rower this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone	10
1	i had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale dumb idea ! as i get older this stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise i need good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes i 've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist i like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability	10
1	i used to have a similar product this one works the same except for one little handy detail it does n't stand on itself like the old one i had	10
1	i bought this for my medium sized 9mm luger with the laser sight attached to it my cousine who has been in the military for several years recommended it to me i'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall and it fits me well he is over six feet tall and it fits him just as well it takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but well worth the money it is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much	10
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses the hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip	10
1	my kids and i have several backpacking stoves and we are currently only using the brunton crux all the others have been mothballed the brunton is well made and very reliable it 's lightweight and very efficient we are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister	10

1	it does the job i have n't had it long enough to attest to its durability too bad the shipping cost more than the product	10
1	i have been using a headlight for years when i work night shift at the hospital when that light gave out i bought this one i like having the three settings of brightness though i had a light on my bike handlebars i wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet it came down to two choices and i went with the aurora since i had been impressed with it at work it turns out that it is brighter than the light i had on my handlebars that i paid more for just last summer now i wish i had gotten an aurora for my handlebars also	10
1	i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping it didnt take much pressure on the toesto be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running great product	10
1	this is the perfect monitor for the average person the chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so i do n't have to look at the watch while using the machines while walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate i have n't used the other features that are offered so i ca n't rate them but it does everything that i wanted out of it when i purchased it	10
1	my treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest strap type that only worked about half the time i never had a problem like that with this one once it 's on it keeps reading until i take it off it 's also compatible with all the treadmills ellipticals bikes at the gym so i do n't have to hold the handles any more	10
1	i'm no professional bike mechanic but this stand has been great for my little at home workshop if you 're looking for a more precise truing stand spend a little more money it does the job if you 're like me and just want you wheels true enough not necessarily perfectly true	10
1	here 's a secret for the uninformed this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you 're a regular ebay seller it 's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two but remember it 's a secret	10
1	smith wesson is an american arms maker the flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight the more important aspect is that it uses two aa batteries which are easy to find and economical it came with two energizer aa batteries three white leds are bright enough for general purposes i keep it in my car 's glove box	10

1	good knife to throw in your survival kit compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made	10
1	powerbars were created out of necesity to be efficient not to taste like a 2 50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out if you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food eat food like a steak a piece of cake or a banana power bars were made for energy in the 1980 's people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them power bars are practically synonymous with the term energy bar because they are the time honored benchmark try a cliff bar or a snickers if you are looking for something tasty when you get tired of those and long for something more in life try a powerbar	10
1	this is the second time that i purchased this backpack the first time was over 5 years ago when my son was starting highschool now he is a 2nd year student in college and it is time to replace the original one why not get the bag that has lasted so long	10

1	deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off in 2 6 x9 areas were discovered during move out this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors simply rubbed the felt like stick over the area and the gouges seemed to fill in ! applied 2 more layers and were amazed ! could n't tell where they were	10

0	i have rented this video for the sake of a trip down memory lane of course fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility i hated this video for its teaching of american ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable for example in	11
0	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about 4 5 times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave	11
0	hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very 80 's campy it was corny then as it is now	11
0	this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents \( if you do try it with captions \) it was fun funny and a nice pick me up when one needs a lift	11
0	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
0	great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd	11
0	the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie	11
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	11
0	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly	11
0	this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own self worth is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl 's movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant quot homemaker quot if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too	11
0	by the time you see the ending you 'll already be wishing that you had n't watched this movie	11
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	11
0	the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something	11
0	i was very disappointed the acting by the principles was fine but i think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by bob fosse i think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs the following tunes from the original show were left out near to you we 've got to think about the game a man does n't know and applegate 's tune the good old days was abridged a new tune there 's something about an empty chair was added to replace near to you but it was very weak i wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they 've done recently with music man and bye bye birdie	11
0	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	11
0	i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows i'm not so i could n't tell you mediocre at best this is spinal tap was better	11

0	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	11
0	i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard	11
0	this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke	11
0	the move is one of my favorite sci fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it	11
0	almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree	11
0	i get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide ! \? the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! \? ! \? it is not matching the character	11
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	11
0	this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen \? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town \? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie	11

0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11
0	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	11

0	i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it 's cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole	11
0	this movies rates right up there with schindler 's list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence \( aka the civil war \) watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 2005	11
0	please think this dvd is recorded in 1986 more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of quot company quot \( same worst sound quality documentary \) i suspect the word quot concert quot or quot soundtrack quot in dvd title	11
0	i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmira \( the camp in elmira n y the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate \)	11
0	i would have given this film 0 stars if possible this film was long boring and painful to watch if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films do not be deceived by this one it is nothing like those types of films	11
0	this movie is laughable today it 's very dated and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards it appears like a low budget flick	11
0	this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents \( if you do try it with captions \) it was fun funny and a nice pick me up when one needs a lift	11
0	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	11
0	a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis	11
0	i love this film it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i 'd have given 5 stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i 've ever seen	11
0	this movie could 've been something had they gotten some real actors a script and a director well they did n't and this movie is an embarassment to mankind	11

0	this must have seemed like a great idea at the time cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor the problem is his range is all the way from a to b this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many chance happenings in the end all we get is this thriller \( and i use the term very loosely \) that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling	11

0	sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful	11
0	i got this film because i'm from detroit where this takes place it 's a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe	11
0	i was expecting much more from this video it did have kids doing poses but it was hard to find the 13 year old some of the circle games looked like they might be fun i wanted to show it to my third grade class but i do n't think it would hold their interest all in all i felt i was watching someone 's home video of their family doing yoga	11
0	this is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 new york \( there are generous aerial views lots of location shooting etc \) than as a horror movie even a cheesy one the special effects are used extremely sparingly with the word special being a definite overstatement some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings but not by much in the end q the winged serpent is watchable and certainly not horribly bad but it 's hard to imagine this being anybody 's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure to end on a positive note the dvd features a clean sharp print of the film	11
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction \( he makes the best of a limited repertoire \) it just gets boring	11
0	i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch that is how good it is	11

0	the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great \( i 'll try and remember that next time \) the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward you 'll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it happy viewing	11

0	i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more	11
0	while a wonderful story this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch a bit hard to understand why the child of two english parents would speak like she 's from new jersey ! i could n't watch the end of this it was so bad recommend you see another version	11

0	this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it 's trying to convey it 's lost in the plotless story	11

0	jet li as a contrac killer \? come on ! the reason why this movie is n't that famous is because it pretty much sucks it 's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie no realy kung fu here	11
0	it 's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to hollywood for a new version of fahrenehit 451 although i appreciate what truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties the movie just does not hold up well in 2007 particularly when shown in a high school classroom advancements in cgi could transform bradbury 's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller my students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically that being said the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie did n't satisfy their understanding lose the wires on the jet packs !	11
0	quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	11
0	i could n't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do \? mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i did n't finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing	11
0	but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing	11

0	i rented this and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up tech support couldnt help me and instead just refunded my money it was nothing but a waste of time	11
0	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
0	i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch	11
0	this is one of the most boring films i ever watched there is nothing erotic in it the whole story is perverted with a poor innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various lovers she is introduced i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings	11
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
0	i agree with most of the reviews here that the movie is just so bad the director had the wrong idea of an art film methophors and strange incoherrent ending is not the only thing you need to make an art film i was pretty intrigued by the lead 's obssession with the hunky swimmer but it just did not end the movie satisfactorily can anyone explain like when did he have the rubber suite whats with the garbage dump ending it is just too pointless ! ! ! i felt cheated of 90 mins of my life	11
0	as i recall 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and point blank in my opinion would be one of the worst films i have ever watched notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film the acting by such notables as lee marvin carroll o'conner and angie dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis jointed and nonsensical dialogue flashbacks san quentin the san francisco skyline cannot save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history if your a lee marvin fan better to watch the man who shot libery valance twice than waste your time on point blank your disposition will be better for it	11
0	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord \? and mad \? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude	11
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware	11
0	bernard hermman 's score is magnificent this was a major let down for me considering it was directed by truffaut lacked any real suspense and edge boring camera work for the most part some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster the acting was fine i guess it was just a pointless story i felt that really did n't go anywhere and what was with that crummy ending	11
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	11
0	it 's always a pleasure to see fred 's legwork but his relationship with hepburn is completely implausible due to huge age difference and weak plot	11

0	i am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie it is merely a monument to hollywood 's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale in dumas 's book the count learns that he cannot play god dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life he abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful god hollywood gives us instead triumphant revenge	11
0	save your money or give it to charity this is one of the worst films for a long time the characters are one dimensional you do n't care who they are and when they die you 're indifferent the direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory i was so bored with this film that i ca n't even bring myself to write anything else about it	11
0	all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man \)	11

0	i too was n't very impressed with jarhead i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines and perhaps other branches of the military for those of us who have n't i just do n't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested as someone else mentione i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it was n't	11
0	maybe i'm spoiled by big budget sci fi films but i thought this movie kind of stunk it felt and looked like a tv movie and was n't scary at all the best funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady 's name or face and everyone described her the same way the one with the glasses oh her have n't seen her lol	11

0	i'm an animation fan and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out while the animation was fine \( although a tad creepy \) i found the story off putting its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a k a substance d i found this film depressing and annoying i particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch it almost gave me a headache 1 star did not like	11
0	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	11
0	i'm sorry i really really tried to get into this movie and just could n't it was just plain boring normally i love these types of movies but not this one i just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile never happened i would recommend renting this one first just to make sure	11

0	this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve 's writings never disappoint read the book instead	11
0	i did n't even open this copy of gothic as soon as i realized it was n't letterboxed i immediately returned it i 've seen the movie before i love ken russell but i wont' watch it if is n't in letterbox	11
0	this was a critically lauded film so when i went in i had high expectations roger ebert himself called it a masterpiece i saw it and it was certainly interesting but i immediately forgot about it right after i left the theater there really is n't much depth here it 's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something then after it wears off you do n't even remember how you felt afterwards i remember a scene where a cow is blown up but other than that it 's hard for me to remember anything about it it ultimately was very ordinary and not a really deep film about war	11

0	jeremy brett was by this time indeed quot the dying detective quot but his real life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic rendition of one of conan doyle 's more tasteless holmes stories the original features some of holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of poor watson but since this series made such a thing of their friendship the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it stick with the brett episodes from the mid 80s when he was fresh in the role and the adaptations were true and intelligent	11
0	i watched anger management on the plane since there is nothing else to watch and the flight is more than ten hours you usually watch whatever is on t v i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad though there are some funny parts there is some offensive language overall it 's a bad movie and is not worth watching	11
0	the unbox video version of this film for tivo is useless only after purchasing it did i discover that this film can only be downloaded to a tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period for more than the cost of the dvd i'm restricted in when where and how i can watch this movie nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios i will not purchase another tivo unbox film	11

0	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it 's one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her	11

0	maybe it 's because he is such a stright shooter \( pun ment \) or something but clint does n't do cold war thrillers very well \( remember firefox \) while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they do n't cover up the fact that it was a good book that does n't watch as good as it read some may like it but i found it to be a let down	11

0	set against the backdrop of the spanish civil war quot talk of angels quot could have been provocative and sweeping but it settles for little more than standard issue governess falls for the rich guy romance vincent perez has a smoldering presence but the beautiful polly walker is as flat on screen as a fascist protest poster the two have little chemistry the result a stilted and perfunctory outing the only saving grace is the always wonderful frances mcdormand whose hard bitten love struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest	11
0	i was n't expecting disney but i was less than thrilled by this feature i'm assuming there 's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70 's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything but i could n't get through this whole film	11

0	not that i know everything about crime especially getting away with it but a shock to the system made it look too easy performances by michael caine as a done wrong now doin' wrong angry executive and will patton as the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on television but a shock to the system needed to close a few holes in its story to make it worthy of your movie theater home video payment	11
0	two moderately decent looking white people who apparently are n't very good at sex go at it in this movie if that 's your thing why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it \? at least then you wo n't have to listen to the cornball pseudo artistic dialogue in this film what a crock they could at least have cast a fine young sista like rosario dawson or gabrielle union to make this movie moan and squeal ! this movie makes sex seem boring	11

0	this was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by sir arthur conan doyle it did n't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters the plot and scripting are incredibly weak it seems the editors just stopped mid movie and rolled the credits there the cgi dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff in my opinion not worth the 83 it costs	11

0	lorna is pretty and her suitor is devoted the story holds your attention for many that is enough some auspicious beginnings without depth so maybe 3 stars for some people i give 2 stars if i do not keep it to watch again in later years i found the romance unfulfilling and so the movie romance movies that i liked better are north south pride prejudice 1940 1996 2006 wives and daughters and a walk to remember adventure with romance the scarlet pimpernel	11
0	just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children movies have ratings for a reason this movie is rated pg 13 which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children in this case it is crude humor what i do n't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience should n't see it	11

0	to be quite honest although there was a stunning cast the plot was gory it was sweet and had it 's element of romance but it was too morbid for me to enjoy if you are watching for drew barrymore do n't bother she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards dean cain on the other hand looks mighty fine if you 're after a gay man it 's not the type of movie you want your children to watch trust me	11

0	george segal is a good actor but he is out of his element in this type of movie he is much better in light hearted movies like fun with dick and jane the biggest disappointment is the dialog by harold pinter the characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens and we all get bored this spy movie is not even in the same league with day of the jackel and the odessa file i threw away my copy of the quiller memorandum after watching it once i ca n't imagine ever wanting to see it again	11

0	i am a huge fan of bbc period drama and have nearly exhausted my library 's supply of miniseries based on the works of austen gaskell dickens and eliot but i would have to say that the bbc struck out this time the direction was bad the acting was mediocre at best the music was obtrustive and the screenplay was just plain awful after the first half hour my sisters and i survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another i have not read the book so i do n't know how much of it is from the source material makes me curious to read it though the costumes and some of the scenery were good i 'll give it that	11
0	i was very unimpressed with this movie borat suffers from the same delusion as sarah silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect automatically equals funny it does not of course sometimes it can be hilarious \( and borat does have moments like that \) but overall i did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing especially the scene where the naked friend sits on borat 's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on at some point i just fast forwarded it you 're not missing much if you do n't watch this movie	11
0	i have no idea why i saw this movie in the first place perhaps it was because the jungle book is a fascinating story however i was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly \( in a stupid way \) the action scenes were terrible i recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies	11

0	the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love	11
0	everthing about this movie was bad the acting the story the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor the acting and production value was so bad that you 'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975 how much did it cost them to film this movie \? 50 bucks \? the revenge of the nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with	11
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con	11

0	this film was dreadful streisand is absolutely unlikeable to enjoy this film you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was along with the english patient this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing	11

0	an hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay there is n't much else granted there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments but it 's often dull	11
0	only worth the second stop motion sequence when flesh fights a robot twig that scene is almost flawless and as good as any harryhausen animation the one love scene with flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice the film is worth a rent if your curious but it 's really just a lame and unfunny movie if your open to seeing a trashy sci fi satire of flash gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look especially fans of stop motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences	11
0	i enjoyed this movie i orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies i would n't really call it a porn movie it 's more of a movie with adult humor i 'd give it an r rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today	11

0	i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it i was not shocked with the horrible acting but was surprised with the hot stars this movie had both hot guys and girls the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht freddy he is so hot we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body he did a great job in his breif scene josh edwards trian was okay to look at too as for the actress venesa taylor is also hot	11

0	this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve 's writings never disappoint read the book instead	11

0	sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino 's top gun bit \( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off \) there 's nothing worthwhile here	11

0	this has got to be one of the worst films i 've ever seen the characters are pointless and one dimensional the guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy they have sudden fights over apparently nothing in fact there is no cause and effect in this movie at all ! things just happen randomly for no apparent reason there 's no real story the takes are boring most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing the violent ending was n't even believable ! instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy i was left just thinking what the \? \? \? really really pointless all around	11

0	it 's not just that if lucy fell is a bad film 90 of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer director star eric schaeffer 's nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday 's roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he 's cute speaks volumes	11

0	i'm a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it 's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen	11

0	if you want erotica then this is n't the emanuelle film for you yes there are a couple of so so love scenes but the one lesbian scene is pratically non existent and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content i expected more erotic content and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that i did n't particularly expect remember that scene in quot tarzan the ape man quot where a nude bo derek was tied up and bathed by native women \? that scene was erotic nothing like that one this video	11

0	interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative poorly composed and add little or nothing to the experience looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line i 've lived in rural japan and it 's the most boring place on earth \( perhaps the intent here but hardly something you 'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only \) you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all	11

0	this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson 's performances not to mention jeff tweedy 's music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there was n't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you do n't need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	11

0	cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he 's a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one 's a dog	11
0	there is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book we used this book in for our men 's study group and every one of the men and every one of the wives agreed that this was a worthless book it was written for a 1950 's wife that no longer exists now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are discovering the mind of a woman by ken nairif only he knew by gary smalleytogether forever how to overcome problems and rekindle the love in your marriageby anne kristin carrollthey are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband	11

0	i brought this movie a couple of days ago and i was very very very disappointed do n't waste your money on this movie	11
0	this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11
0	one of the most pretentious and exaggerating movies ever seen the dialogue the acting whatever all suck big time everything in this movie looked unrealistic not funny but pathetically pretentious and exaggerating to the extreme that kinda performance would have won an oscar yeah right maybe just because there were only worse pictures nominated in that year what a hype	11
0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11

0	i have not seen this movie but thanks to the review of a viewer from july 2001 i do n't have to	11
0	well do n't know where to start bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it stuart gorden is director and they did a good job on re animator but let me tell you horror freaks will be disapointed only one really bloody scene is worth watching not because of the blood not because of the gore just because it is the only bloody scene in the movie a nice looking woman is eaten by the castel freak if you have seen re animator the evil dead from beyond hellraiser and maybe the thing then skip this one you will be disapointed like me even a john woo action movie has more blood in it	11

0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from \? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie	11

0	this is what happens when you buy movies that amazon recommends i consider my extreme boredom with this movie my punishment for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy do n't let the fantastic cast lure you this movie is boring ! true it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends more often than not do n't necessarily go anywhere and oftentimes the texture of a movie is not in the conversations themselves but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations but nevertheless do not waste your money on this movie did i mention that it was boring	11

0	this movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold martin does a great job with nick nolte as an artist in life lessons and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching ford coppolas somthing zoe i began to tire and by the end of woody allens snoozefest i was bored stiff my advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off the first 30 minutes is great film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film	11

0	filmed in 1933 this movie is in black and white and might be considered dull and slow moving by today 's standards an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research	11

0	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse worst of the worst abc afterschool specials if you had not read the book you would be unable to follow what was happening some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time the original evil dead with all its flaws is a better put together film than this one this movie is flat out painful to watch you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do it all seems so random read the book if you see this movie in a rental store just move along please nothing to see here	11

0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from \? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie	11

0	this is one of our favorite movies but when we sat down to enjoy it the last 2 scene segments would not play very unsettling	11
0	do n't waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it did n't do any damage to ruin the movie i could n't wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you 'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off do n't waste your money spend it on the cheap 5 6 horror dvd 's because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	11
0	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11

0	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped	11

0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
0	oh please whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette' do so and make it available on dvd this was one of the finest shows ever created for television truly it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now 40 years later i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd for the sake of one of the theater \( and humanity 's \) most glorious theatrical efforts please make the original tv version available ! \( btw i rate the original item at 5 stars !	11

0	i'm rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000 without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the 20 dollar price tag amazon com has right now	11
0	if you are n't really into jokes about the difference between black white sex drugs and how bad gays are this is not for you i had seen other stuff by pryor i always liked but this time i never once really laughed out loud it was dissapointing good thing he has so many other good stuf	11
0	richard pryor is my all time favorite stand up comedian i consider him the best in the business but his performance in quot live and smokin quot shows he 's still just a rookie he 's nervous in front of the camera and says so several times his material is typically raunchy but not very funny you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience buy this tape only if you 're a die hard pryor fan but do n't expect the side splitting laughter you 'll get from quot in concert quot quot live on the sunset strip quot and quot here and now quot	11

0	the dynamic root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children 's comedy my advice to root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash the only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child curtis big props to my man for his preformance hope to see you in more movies to come p s i think taylor root is still a virgin	11

0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	11
0	this movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over acting i found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying	11
0	i thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular it kept me awake but just on the verge the few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie i thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best overall i was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star	11

0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11

0	i might have enjoyed this movie more if they had n't gutted the book which was a pretty good read the best character in the book fbi special agent pendergast is n't even in the movie and new york city police lt d'agosta is just a comic caricature of the book 's character another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything if the purpose was to create a moody scary atmosphere they went way too far see if you must but do n't expect too much	11

0	it 's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe horned into such a bad movie i do n't see how it could have yielded six 5 star reviews \( the godfather it ai n't \) using its better scenes you could put together a trailer for this movie that would make you want to see it and you may be entertained through much of the movie but when the story becomes quite nonsensical in the final minutes of the movie you will feal cheated and wish that you had watched something else at least that 's how everyone in my family felt when we watched it	11

0	a comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of heaven \( fanny ardant victoria abril \) and hell \( gael garcia bernal penelope cruz \) battling over the soul of a mexican boxer is promising but this attempt at satire full of symbolism \( hell is represented by english speaking executives for example \) is clumsily executed only rarely amusing and the superb fanny ardant is not given anything to do what a waste ! you 'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors	11

0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	11

0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11

0	this movie is the worst piece of clap trap that i have ever seen built in the mold of the rambo series the film tries to play off of the west 's fear of the soviet union you 'd be better of watching a quot how to pour milk quot instructional video than watch this film that will make you less smart	11
0	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it blah you 're better off buying the dvd for 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer	11
0	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky i found altered states his first novel terribly disappointing the film was in my view utterly dismal the only reason i would recommend it would be as an example of hack movie making if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell both would be relegated to obscurity	11

0	this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it 's also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice's adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what 's previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that 's been out there for ages faded colors pan and scan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame	11

0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11

0	ok so i have always thought courteney cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it it really is the most boring show ive seen in a long time if you thought she was bad in scream and friends dont watch this there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it hopefully this show will be scraped	11

0	that 's basically my two cents shallow characters bizarre story i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films but i do like a good story and heard this was one it was not all of the characters were inverted ada and her daughter were utterly irritating george was disgusting from start to finish and sam neill 's character \( supposedly the heartless jerk \) was actually the easiest to sympathize with how frustrating ! on a positive note michael nyman 's score is unbelievable i love it	11
0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	11

0	i'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot it 's redundant and unnecessary and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that 's based on and well my gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it 's original format onto dvd was bad the soundtrack is about 1 2 to 1 second off from the video part of film therefore the voices do n't sync up with the lip movement	11

0	i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie this movie is contrived the character that reeve plays acts like a star struck groupie personally i do n't find his behavior to be romantic he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him this is not romantic to most women nowadays he is not suave in the role he is playing it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it	11

0	albert pyun is my absolute least favorite director i hate his guts his direction ruined quot cyborg quot and was murky in quot omega doom quot this is his best flick and it 's not that good in fact it pales in comparison to the so so original sasha mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable but highly forgettable the villain from the first tong po has returned after killing the sloan brothers from the first movie now he 's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother david sloan standard martial arts fare some choppy fight scenes but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck	11
0	okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people 's relationships \? \? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked	11
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i'm very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i'm not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog	11
0	blech ! i really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute wrong ! it was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were the only redeeming actor was justin long the rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells	11

0	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	11

0	i bought this movie because i thought it would be like the movie version of louis l'amour 's conagher unfortunately it is a far cry from that movie the quick and the dead was too predictable the dialog was stilted and unrealistic and the characters well they were too much in character and not believable i am curious how faithful the script was to the book if the movie is as faithful to the book as conagher was then i apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with mr l'amour instead	11
0	i did n't even see this movie and i know it sucks all that i had to see was bon jovi and i threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out it was worth it though it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist the vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential i guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as vampires los muertos	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11

0	cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he 's a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one 's a dog	11
0	recently i read about the revival of a chorus line on broadway i 've never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek well somewhat disappointed here i can only assume that the stage version with its long running reputation must be better than this film it 's not that the film is a total debacle but it 's only mildly pleasant and quickly forgettable even songs which i had heard before like what i did for love were reduced to barely a mention in the film the film seemed to lack any real point a bit of a yawner	11
0	this movie was even more ignorant \( in a bad way \) compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well the name of the movie \( dumberer \) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh do n't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it 's worth every penny for comedy fans	11

0	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse jet li was pretty good but how the hell do you screw that up tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie but it still turns out horribley i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	11
0	i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on \? or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the 80 's flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie	11

0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11
0	this is one of the most offensive and anti gay movies i have ever seen do n't let the title or the box fool you every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment i was shocked that such a film could come out of france if you 're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass \( verbally and physically \) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job then rent this and snack on a can of worms hideous	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11

0	this film is about a female student at randolph university in alabama in the early 60 's who is a writer for the school newspaper she gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement it could have been a decent movie but i found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing a much much better movie on this theme is the long walk home and also the ghosts of mississippi	11

1	this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it	11
1	for those who do n't know russian the title of this was \( 1055 1088 1086 1089 1084 1086 1090 1088 1077 1085 1080 1077 k 19 review of k 19 thought i 'd be funny there \) this movie is not so much a combat movie it 's a what happened movie the flagship of the russian navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 captians yea that kinda do n't go over so well they have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys it is quite a gripping movie though this is also one that needs to be bought not just rented	11
1	this great film will finally be available on dvd on january 31st 2006	11
1	for me quot get a life quot provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy from chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien \( in home video volume 2 \) which is anything but cuddly i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of quot get a life quot episodes	11
1	my wife and i just watched this disney movie with our 8 year old son the colors are exquisite deeply saturated clear crisp detail and picture quality is incredible sound quality was substantially better than the original all 6 channels of sound were strong without being harsh and convey a sense of beauty the film is all about the triumph of human spririt i'm sure that the girls will relate to the princess but my son was impressed as well thanks disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic i will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family	11

1	this is a nice love story a little dumbed down but with a great message the money may be the root of all evil and what is important is the human heart this is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world nicholas cage is one of our finest commercial actors he proves is versatility in this picture what ever happened to bridget fonda \? \? j	11
1	this movie combines two things i love in a film the actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents this is animprov lover 's dream andit makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously in thiscase dog shows only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog 's rating in context mainly though it is just hilarious some \( okay a lot \) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately and nearly too crude for me still it fits the genre	11
1	fantastic film memticulous and carefully built loaded of the highest suspense you may expect in this clever film noir eastwood is an outsider he is not a detective but a jewel thief who watchs something he never had to see this brutal murderer will reach the highest governement levels in which a very well planned chase will be made behind the traces of eastwood a great script hackman is absolute convincing in the best role which he has represented more than any one else the immoral corrupt decadent and perverse villain intelligent puzzle and artistic film prove once more than industry and craft may join one of the best films in his career	11
1	great movie definately original and something many chicanos living is socal can relate to or be familiar with	11

1	i expected to learn how to build a gypsy wagon so i could join a caravan this movie did not help at all worthless ! i thought i would find a complex and riveting tapestry of deep and well developed characters and storylines what a disappointment ! i just knew i would come away with a better understanding of cutting edge business management techniques ! total waste of time ! instead i had to sit through a long film of incredible landscapes beautiful people and amazing music that altogether gave me a new and wonderful understanding of gypsies eurasia and history and i watched it about thirty times it 's excellent i mean terrible ! whatever get it and watch it	11
1	far more complex and feministic than the girls and flapper fashions would have you believe needs to be seen in it 's entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as upstairs downstairs if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company	11
1	i caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and i could not remember the name but i did know who stared in it so when i went online to get the name of this i was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly ! ! ! thanks again ! !	11
1	one of th ebest comedies of the middle 90 's this is basically your average quot rich kid learns to be a man quot story it features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and the mermaid if you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look	11
1	this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio	11
1	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama go for this emblematic film where paul newman makes a delirious performance	11
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met head to head this movie answers that question very well no cheesiness we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest great saturday evening movie	11
1	this dvd brings me back to when i was growing up in the 70 's i am happy to share this with my kids who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or rosie greer singing it 's alright to cry one of the highlights is the duet by roberta flack and a young michael jackson singing you do n't have to change at all i am so happy i am able to have this piece of my childhood to share	11
1	big fan of 80 's music and culture and most of all the movies she 's having a baby is not just a teen movie like sweet sixteen or breakfast club its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day soundtrac is great with kate bush the woman 's work my girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played i told her i 'll feel the same if she were the wife boy i got lovin that nite i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80 's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby i thought it was clever	11
1	received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems	11
1	well this is one of the long waited dvds from pink floyd the video and sound are great the extras are not so special but for the pf fan this is a must still waiting for the delicate sound of thunder dvd	11
1	there are a great many gay themed films available today but when longtime companion was released it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes something that continues to beset filmmakers even today set during the late 70 's and on into the 80 's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before and after portrait of the devastating effects of the aids virus on a small group of close friends lovers and on the wider gay community very funny extremely moving occasionally upsetting whether you are a gay viewer or not this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit	11
1	i begged to see this movie in 1985 ! i was only 14 but i knew i had to see it and buy the soundtrack \( remember cassettes \? \) never has rob lowe or emilio estevez looked better ! hot hot hot ! ! no this is n't oscar worthy or anything but if you are a die hard 80 's brat packer this is the one !	11
1	this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect	11
1	spalding gray is stream of consiousness on speed over before you know it you 'll know a lot more when it 's over	11
1	a family oriented film that is humorous fun exciting and very entertaining ! after seeing this movie for the first time i had to own it ! it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean this is a must own for the family	11
1	i was contemplating on getting the director 's cut of gone in 60 seconds until i looked at the time length usualy a director 's ct has more added to it not taken away believe it or not but the original released version of gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the director 's cut release has a minute less footage for those that do n't care it 's not a big thing but for movie goers a minute off takes alot away unless you 're in it for the new extra features	11
1	great movie there is n't anything i can say that has n't been said 100 times	11
1	arnold schwarzenegger stars as detective john kimble a man who has been chasing a drug dealer named cullen crisp when he finally tracks crisp down he learns that the only way he can put crisp away is by having his ex wife testify against him kimble finds out the name of the school crisp 's son attends he is then assigned a new partner phoebe o'hara who is going to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher and the two travel to astoria oregon unfortunately for kimble o'hara becomes ill and the only person who can take her place is him	11
1	wow let me start off by telling you that i had this video personally when i was younger i would ask for it constantly and can still remember having it and watching it everyday it really helped me learn and the drawings are great ! somewhere in the process of 'growing up ' the video was lost and i'm still upset about it i'm not ready to have kids myself but i know that when i do i definitely want to re purchase this video ! it 's so great to have things like this to help your children start learning at a young age and i recommend it to everyone	11
1	this is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions climatic extremes lack of water and nutrient poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate this type of recycling may become a necessity hopefully it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts an eye opener for sure	11
1	i knew i should have waited ! i got impatient and bought the masterworks dvd and after watching it once could not bear to see it again the colors were that awful of course i have to get this but it 's still galling now if they would only release el amour brujo	11
1	i cannot believe how mean and down dirty elections can get when they get too close does it tell us something about the election process it needs to become kinder democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it it can be done ! it would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it like it was pushing an agenda good awareness piece though	11
1	a light hearted but still kind of sas movie poweful	11
1	this is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book the cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous this film will delight both children and adults with it 's adventure suspense and innocent romance it 's a little spooky in some scenes but of the fun rather than truly scary kind this story has a very positive underlying message but does n't preach rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the secret garden and of themselves no matter what age you are this is a thoroughly enjoyable uplifting perhaps even transformative film do n't miss it	11
1	i really like these tapes the first one is pretty easy but it is very relaxing and i use it on days when i want to take it easy the second one is somewhat challenging and the third one is even more so these tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one tracy rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable i also like how they \( ganga white and tracy \) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced	11
1	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
1	i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis why though must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again \? i suspect \( and hope \) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you do n't already own any of these and are a fan of broadway theatre or the performing arts in general buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent	11
1	i'm delighted to see there are n't a string of 1 star reviews from people who do n't get a mighty wind if it has a weakness its that its played so dryly its almost like non fiction that just happens to be funny thank god for fred willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these serious proceedings i share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters i 've never liked folk music but somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times without being too cynical itself my one dissapointment is that we do n't get to see ed begley jr sing how 's it hangin' grandma \? in swedish talk about a missed opportunity	11
1	this movie has great casting the actors play characters that they usually do n't play this may be the best acting i have ever seen keeanu reeves do	11
1	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie but this movie is a definite exception it possessed a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly captivating scenery that is incredible and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie it piques the curiosity it warms the heart and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it buy it you wo n't regret it	11
1	justice in the criminal justice system \? what is that but empty talk in the real world \? in hell shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife 's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system no macho van damme kickboxing here but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate a true portrayal of life in today 's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men and corrupt power brokers who run them	11
1	i was looking for solyent green since i was young after seeing it in theater as a science fiction drama now that i found it i do not know if i am very happy to see it again considering that it might be closer to reality than to sci f	11
1	this movie is a classic especially for those who love tim roth	11
1	this story is so fascinating that i could n't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one 's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer arenas to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in cuba under castro johnny depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting drag queen	11
1	this movie would probably not be on anyone 's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980 's b flick movie loving enthusiast ! the stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80 's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious ! i remember renting this movie \( on beta \) in my childhood over and over again much to my parents chagrin the stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is	11
1	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville a prison camp that turned into a death camp not enough food water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa	11
1	as a fan of new order and joy division this was on the top of my list fast paced witty and shot in documentary like style 24 hour party people is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like go all gone pete tong groove etc winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and steve coogan is terrific the soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high not to be missed by fans \( not ultimate fans \) and general movie goers alike	11
1	this was not the scariest film i 've ever seen and i really ca n't take horror very well but it was good because there was beauty in it and that is quite rare in horror films i think the idea of the film was very good and surprise in the end too even though the plot was not so brilliant i actually liked it i 'll probablu rent it again and watch it this time with sound	11
1	this movie is a wonderful follow up to the first anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time i highly recommend this movie to anyone	11
1	the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions	11
1	school house rock is mad awesome cool ! i love all the song like i'm just a bill i memorized the preamble cause of the preamble song thing peac	11
1	this movie is a must have for all family libraries it appeals to adults and youth alike a true feel good movie about how we are all the same inside no matter what our outward differences are really teaches the lesson do n't judge a book by its cover	11
1	this film having been produced in 1957 was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a d i at p i it showed for two consecutive nights and i think every d i on p i somehow arranged to see it we wanted to see if they got it right i guess i viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic a most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times i highly recommend it	11
1	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert granted they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim this is truly a broadway event the documentary which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	11
1	this is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject the clips of ginsberg amp burroughs are especially effective the celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself amp not just empty theatrics the beats are still a source to return to for inspiration amp insight the world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now of course there 's more but this video gives you enough to get you started amp gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late	11
1	cannes man was funny i do n't know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster but it made me laugh out loud just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who do n't know their s from a hole in the ground	11
1	my two and three year olds have almost all the baby einstein dvd and this is one of their favorite they beg to watch it and laugh out loud at the puppets as usual i am happy with the classical music art work and learning elements	11
1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	11
1	contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has no subtitles or closed captions or whatever the r2 neither so again do n't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff non anamorphic or simply 4 3 format no subs not available at all \( yes i mean you disney \) in short no quality or consistency go and take a hike stop lobbying for legislation and start making real dvd 's	11
1	robin williams is an afrs disc jockey in saigon during the vietnam war he is fast talking zany unconventional and a problem for his superiors williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten the movie is an exhausting experience to watch as it must have been for williams to perform it 's an amazing one man show but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty	11
1	let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime the plot is basically a cybernetic government agent major motoko kusanagi who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called the puppet master from start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline i think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough there is a lot of violence and some language also some slight nudity but very non sexual overall i think this is one of the best anime ever	11
1	i can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time i saw this movie while i did n't understand it then i found that the music and the scenery was breath taking seeing this movie years later along with other great 's such as young bess and mary queen of scots helena carter 's and cary elwes performance 's are right up there with such great names as stuart granger and jean simmons i would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies but like i said do n't take into account that the history is a little jumbled just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot	11

1	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11

1	overwhelming in sincerity and pain to watch and observe stephan 's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time this cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour i was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish a great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list	11
1	there are a whole bunch of films from the 70 's that deserve a dvd release and this is one of them	11
1	after her amazing performance in misery bates takes the role of another stephen king character dolores claiborne dolores is a tough bitter sarcastic woman who is accused of murdering her despotic employer vera donovan we are all hasty to set a judgement upon her but as her story unfolds we realize that things are far more complex than what they seemed at the beginning of the movie jennifer jason leigh proves why she is one of the best young actresses around by playing celina dolores 's troubled daughter who hates her mother for the wrong reasons i own this dvd since 2000 and it is still one of my favorites	11
1	there are few great movies that will make shed a tear but this one is really great daughters do n't know how much their mothers will go for them they just understand their mothers when they get to be one this movie the place the weather the circumstances is so depressive but beautiful dolores started to work hard out of love for her child after that she worked because of gratitude what a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end at the beginning i was weary about this movie because is based on stephen king 's work but this movie really proved me wrong	11
1	this is another american remake of the original danish movie starring stellan skarsgard which is more interesting than this remake i always wonder why when hollywood does a remake they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place even though i give this remake 4 stars mainly because al pacino and robin williams restrained themselves and that hollywood changed the ending check out the original i give the danish original 5 stars	11
1	this wonderful little book is for you the student of screenwriting how do i know \? i had the good fortune of being in dr claudia hunter johnson 's screenwriting class at florida state university we used the methods described in her book and they work ! if you are disciplined enough to follow her process you will amaze yourself you will begin with le menu \( your very own personal autobiography \) and finish with a well crafted script although you will not have her direct feedback you will have the benefit of a script coach who has helped launch a thousand careers tom	11

1	i had viewed this movie on tv a while ago i am a hospice nurse and found this movie so down to earth and informative about what a person 's thoughts might be in the face of a debilitating condition most of the nurses that i work with have gained new insight lest i lead you astray this is not a documentary for medical personnel it is a wonderful protrayal of one woman 's battle	11
1	once more the irreverent vision of georges bernard shaw carves in relief with this story about a rich girl who decides to join the salvation army wendy hiller one of my beloved brides of the screen makes a delightful and terrific performance in this satire of mistakes where she will discover the other side of the life	11

1	putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that 's not what matters this film is amazing	11
1	i never really knew of matthew modine until i saw this movie he was very good in the part and i have watched the movie several times i also purchased the book as well	11
1	everyone should see this movie also everyone should buy it so they can show it to their friends so the word can keep spreading and hopefully and finally justice will be served	11
1	seriously guys if this film says anything to you then it is your duty to do something these young men were wrongfully imprisoned im not saying you have to donate your college fund but atleast spread the word tell people about www wm3 org tell people about wm3 awareness day \( july 23 \) go to events tell everyone you know about this cause and while you are saying i do n't have time for this remember that what is 5 minutes to you could help these boys have 5 minutes more of freedom seriously think about it	11
1	i have seen this movie in the past on tv and am familiar with the story line i have also been to visit boys town since i have family in omaha nebraska i would say if anyone is considering buying this movie do spencer tracy makes a good father flanigan \( the priest who starts up boys town \) in this movie and micky rooney who plays a hoddlem	11
1	i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on \( it 's been some time now \) and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter \( that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon \) a heartbreaking beautifully acted and must see film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore and it 's a shame	11
1	this 1948 15 chapter serial features superman played here by the late kirk alyn going up against a gang of crooks this is a hell of a lot better than the 1950s tv show that featured george reeves ! at least this serial was fun to watch and at least you can get into what's going on in this movie you might not be able to find this serial in stores today but if by some chance you come across this video get it ! ! ! !	11
1	i 've seen it on the orginal screen in a theather saw it many times on the vcr i have this new dvd is superior to both in it 's clarity color and a real gem to own	11
1	this is the way comedy should be done warm funny heart touching with a little craziness thrown in hector elizondo and raquel welch are perfect he 's understated she 's over the top just like the movie the story never bogs down but zips right along nicely the sisters bicker their father worries hortensia \( welch \) does her best to snag him and we laugh great fun ! a note on the rating for parents like me who wonder about the pg13 rating \( one can never tell these days ! \) there 's one woman shown in skimpy underclothing and one sex scene along with sexual references and jokes so this would not be suitable for kids	11
1	an old movie but a good movie the end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow heston and robertson do a great job of acting the pace is a little slower than current special effects of today 's movies if you are not a fast paced dude and can slow down then i would recommend this one for you	11
1	i lvoed this movie i have been looking for it for years the story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great it just wants to make you get up and dance	11

1	i love this movie so much i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance \( i know so random \) when i was in my teens i went out and rented it right away and i have watched it about 100 times since then i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon it 's such a sweet touching story it 's a bit off the wall but that 's of course what i love about it	11
1	i really ca n't say anything new that has n't been said about this great movie except read jean shepherd 's novels you will get a whole new appreciation for the movie and the characters that have become a part of so many of our lives thank you darren mcgavin for giving us the best christmas present ever	11

1	i had never seen this movie and i dont know why ! freddie bartholomew \( top billed as a teen ! \) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching a terrific olio of pathos comedy melodrama and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel \( which im embarrassed to admit i never read \) one of the best movies ive seen great supporting work by lionel barrymore john carradine mickey rooney melvyn douglas more and freddie is quite the beauty here a winner !	11

1	i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head or when she accidently dyed her hair green or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie with gorgeous scenery unforgettable characters and plenty of moments to laugh and cry	11
1	first heard his stand up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back sometimes he gets a bit carried away \( a lotta comics tend to though \) and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to clean \( no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! \) family fun comedy \( dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he she is funny in my eyes \)	11
1	thoroughly enjoyed this product have already watched it numerous times highly recommend this to any chick fan	11
1	anthony hopkins is absolutely riveting as adolf hitler he captures all of hitler 's mannerisms quirks and facial expressions my only complaint is that he does n't use a german accent the production is poor and there are some flaws in the story for example albert speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film it has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by speer the guy who plays joseph goebbels is horrible one of the worst acting jobs i 've seen but overall the acting is great and the performance by hopkins makes this movie worth owning	11
1	this is the original version of this film with david niven peter sellers woody allen and other very familiar faces the film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good but ian fleming intended his 007 to be a non serious serious agent excellent film and i heartily recommend it my 20 something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie had to have the dvd after seeing it on tv	11
1	suspenseful erotic thriller with neve campbell matt dillon kevin bacon and denise richards has the teacher sam lombardo raped his pupil kelly van ryan \? or does the spoilt gal want revenge for being rejected \? the movie with the many twists and turns brilliant story the resolution only comes in the final credits	11

1	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on to top it up the soundtrack on this movie is trully great the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer having seen quite a few criterions i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever raw material they had available	11
1	nuts is a great movie from barbra streisand one of her best acting performances ! the movie is about a high class call girl named claudia \( barbra streisand \) who kills a client in self defense her parents want to avoid scandal by having her declared mentally incompetant to stand trial after attacking her attorney her case is taken over by a legal aide attorney \( richard dreyfuss \) claudia does n't do much to help her case with her constant outbursts in the courtroom it was a really well done drama with an interesting plot and good acting all around	11
1	this two parter commemorates the 10th anniversary of the arthur show on pbs it 's nice they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10 's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how marc brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books it 's nice to see them both together too \( episodes 1 2 \) i think they aired them seperately on tv	11
1	i viewed this film a few years ago when i had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece luis bu uel 's direction is unique i found that the main character 's desposition changes his love for the woman when she gets him angry we see one woman when she makes him happy we see a different woman in the same character i do n't think i 've seen a movie quite like this this movie will stay with you for some time especially if you have a broken heart	11
1	i 've enjoyed the black humor of the various texas chainsaw movies but the gas was running out when this one was made still there are some fairly funny moments and in jokes matt 's performance is a definite highlight it 's worth a look	11

1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy	11

1	scary movie is an instant movie classic director keenan ivory wayans outdies himself in a spoof of horror films involving an innocent teenager named cindy campbell who 's being stalked by a goofy killer in a cheap rendition of scream though funny to watch scary movie also has it 's share of gross out gags and laughs the way wayans slanders horror films is so funny that you ca n't help but laugh out loud	11
1	bo derek plays the title role to perfection in this blake edwards comedy despite what the amazon capsule says julie andrews plays dudley moore 's girlfriend and not his wife watch the film before you write a summary of it ! along with the pink panther films this stands as one of edwards best films it is a high point in the career of dudley moore and he is just perfect as george robert webber also is good as george 's gay cowriter and friend andrews is fine also but what you leave the theatre with is the images of bo derek someone knew how to cast the title character perfectly	11

1	this film must be scrutinized in the light of being tony scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision sarandon and deneuve are in very good shape and bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances after his standout performance in the man who fell to earth and furyo so think about all those factors at the moment you bet for watch it it 's extremely important to my mind this is one of the hottest cult movies of the eighties	11
1	from the first day i watched this video i have picked up so many musical ideas to apply to nearly every genre of music i play \( and being a military rock band bassist i play a lot of different genres \) this video will without a doubt help you become a better player	11

1	my brother henry always said this was his favorite movie he loved film noir \( although i did n't know what that was at the time \) and of course he loved richard widmark in his role looking back widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this \( he was nominated \) but there are many oscar should 'ves if you like prison gangster movies classic film noir richard widmark victor mature and of course brian dunleavy you 've gotta see own this if you hav n't do n't already	11
1	quick and uncomplicated shipping the dvd is still with my parents in law in the states i myself live in germany they bring it at christmas sorry i cannot tell you anything about the qualitiy of the dvd but i assume that it is fine such as the shipping if you want me to do so later please let me know that is why i did not write earlier best regardsjessika krau	11
1	fellows i picked up the dvd in london at a cost of 20 pounds or about us 39 there were still four copies left at the virgin superstore in picadilly circus so you got be able to find it somewhere even not on amazon	11
1	jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism \( highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain \) it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes \( notably the garden party \) would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy	11
1	this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view	11
1	i saw this on tv and loved it so i had to buy it	11
1	ok i like horror movies and i like slashers movies and even if this is a low buget slasher it works very well the cast is unknowens so it gives you the feeling that any of them could die at anytime and that helps plus the guy in the mine suit with the pix ax is very scarey give it a try	11
1	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester	11
1	this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing	11
1	colin firth is the quinessential mr darcy ! this film captures the depth and essence of jane austen 's novel in such a beautiful classic way it is worlds better than the recent keira knightley version whose weak interpretation of the role of lizzie made me appreciate jennifer ehle even more	11
1	i think this is a great movie about a guilt stricken ira gunman based on a book this movie will make you laugh cry and excited this is a must	11
1	it 's right on the scene transitions are nicely done even though a lot of this is predictable it is still funny and makes one eager to see what 's' next fernando literally goes down the line of all the sisters till he has a shot gun wedding with the last the scene between the cuckold and the err cuckolded cuckold is hilarious the sisters are very vivid and pretty \( well except that cruz girl \) overall a very brilliantly done story	11
1	jorge sanz \( a looker \) stars as a soldier deserting from the spanish army during the 1930s civil wars taken into a family who proceeds to fall in love with and seduce all four daughters while forging a father son relationship with the patriarch touching and kinky and off beat a worthy winner of the oscar as best foreign language film in 1992	11
1	the acting in this was very good it had a great cast it 's just such a classic being shakespeare it may be hard for some people to understand at first but you catch on pretty quickly	11
1	al pacino gives the best in this movie shakespeare 's play set on an authentic set in venice with excellent photography nobody could ask for more at least subprime lenders ca n't demand a pound of flesh	11
1	i enjoyed the film it was uncanny bizarre and colorful wow it' was a nice family movie	11
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era katharine ross and sam elliot it 's just fun not really all that scary or even too tense basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance roger daltry makes an appearance the deaths are all way over the top and it 's just fun dvd is the movie plus a trailer that 's about it but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire	11
1	follow one girl 's story into adult hood a beautiful story of romance that is realistic and tragic if you have a romantic bone in your body and you do n't mind crying buy this movie and watch it with your girl friends i lend this movie out as well there is adult content in this with nudity not for the faint of heart have your tissues ready	11
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	11
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention this is not the book this is the vhs movie section i see many book reviews but not a single movie review i'm glad everyone liked the book but we need to see if the movie is any good here i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book but i have seen some movies do a terrible job what about this vhs movie \? has anyone actually seen it \? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price used rental copies for 22 to 125 is outrageous one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money	11
1	thanks for keeping a brit sane in a country full of my wife says jokes your wife is fat and ugly and i do n't care what she says because she 's ugly and fat and not my wife	11

1	this movie is about a bunch of cheerleaders that witness a murder that tommy jones has to take care of the girls always walk around in short clothes and tommy struggles with the concept of he has to live with these women cheerleaders and he also cant find a way to talk to his daughter and these cheerleaders help him do that and also help him with a date he has if you like that type of stuff this movie is for you its funny to me but everyone has an opinio	11
1	i have had this movie on vhs for quite some time andjust recently purchased the dvd this movie tells a great story while revealing l amor 's view of the range cowboys morality there simply are not enough good westerns being made anymore this is a great western i would highly recomend any western that is derived from a louis l amor novel	11
1	if one likes old westerns especially written by louis lemore it is excellent and so is the actors especially sam elliot and katherine ross	11
1	i came away from this movie thinking wow i wish i was like john tucker ! i have never seen anyone make lemonade out of lemons like that man he was good and fine to boot i thought it was entertaining it was clearly more of a teenager movie but i thought it was fun definitely worth a check out	11
1	wonderful and beautifully transferred to dvd excellent production numbers and this just might be my new favorite judy movie grab that bucket of popcorn pop in the dvd and let judy do her thing she is wonderful it will be just a fun evening	11
1	this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso while it touches on his climb to fame recognition and success in the art world it focuses primarily on his personal relationships i love his work but i sure would n't have wanted to live with him ! the video had therapuetic effects for me i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships how they are and how they should and should n't be a winner all the way around	11
1	if you played any of the pc video games than you know how much they left out of this movie still its one of the best b movies i 've ever bought i enjoy it every time i watch it	11
1	truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one	11
1	dangerous beauty is a beautiful period piece based on a non fiction book the movie is set in 16th century venice veronica falls in love with marco but marco comes from a rich family veronica 's mother advises her that she should become a courtesan so that she can spend time with marco veronica does so well at the courtesan business that she becomes a favorite of all the men in the city later she becomes the target of an inquisition by the church for witchcraft a beautiful story about how women survive in society	11
1	a fantasy dealing with the curse of star crossed lovers ladyhawke never fail to be top notch entertainment the cast is exceptional and get their characters right it 's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what 's going on along with dragonslayer this is one of the top fantasy movies the story is compelling the setting has a very gritty dirty feel to it and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages this is not a movie i can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things because it suck me in every time	11
1	this is an excellent movie for the romantic type a real classic ! got it for my wife for her birthday enjoyed it very much	11
1	aside from the rather chintzy quality of the disc itself \( why oh why do n't they re release the special edition again \? \? \? \) the film is fantastic kris lemche is as always sarcastically funny and somehow very real and relate able katherine isabelle is quite convincing in her portrayals of madness and mayhem and emily perkins is uniquely lovable as the younger sister trying to save her sibling from the woes of lycanthropy tightly edited and beautiful in it 's cinematography this is one indie horror flick you do n't want to miss ! ! !	11
1	a schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world michael a young writer comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity sex bigotry and ultimately a true grim view of society as dark as it sounds i found parts of this movie very amusing housewives pass on this one it 's not 'finding nemo' if you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor satire i 'd reccomend you watch this a true must see for the inebriated	11
1	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story it was very imaginative and well acted the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie other than that if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you	11
1	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie micky rourke is excellent \( this is still in the days when he could act \) and so is the rest of this stellar cast well worth it	11
1	grand old movie well acted will watch many times agai	11
1	being a fan of russ meyer movies since classics like mudhoney vixen and lorna it is amazing what happens when russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company likewise italian competitor tinto brass russ gets in feel with picturing erotic in a slight different way i liked this movie very much for it 's blooming 60 's pop feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women i'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on dvd with a great transfer and lots of extras well done \( hope my english is half the way understandable sorry i'm german \)	11
1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy	11
1	in my opinion one of gary coopers greatest roles the background story is excellent making this movie one you can watch over and over	11
1	this movie far exceeds its later edition this edition is disturbing but excellent the violence the gore everything is heart pounding	11
1	my niece and i love the movie we sing thumbelina all the time the movie is a treasure i just wish it had some special features worthy of the movie	11
1	my almost 3 year old loves it she does n't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited' but she 's been able to overlook them she and i love the music together that 's why i bought it in the first place	11
1	my almost 3 year old loves it she does n't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited' but she 's been able to overlook them she and i love the music together that 's why i bought it in the first place	11
1	i have always loved this movie but especially love the music used in the soundtrack it lifts the soul	11
1	i got what i ordered in a timely fashion with no complaints thank you	11
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
1	i highly recommend this dvd for its superior acting all hands as well as for the spectacular photography scenery and overall quality of presentation a real keeper	11
1	probably the best portrayal of louis l'amour 's sackett series although more than one book was used it all ties together casting was excellent i would highly recommend this dvd for all l'amour and or sackett fans	11
1	i love this movie and i do n't have anything bad to say about it but if you get the dvd be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match so you hear an actor speak before their mouths move this drove me crazy but i still enjoyed the movie	11
1	although he was raised by an underworld important personage james cagney will join f b i when a pal is killed by gangsters and he will put all his first hand experience to be useful another little gem of william keighley of the middle thirties	11
1	the dylan \( \? \) lyric to laugh and cry in a single sound came to mind the first time i saw this movie as part of a saturday night film series at the local university 25 years ago it 's just brilliant a wild and manic ride that ends up being completely life affirming you just want to cry out at the end of the movie it 's too good to be true this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen	11
1	if you like denzel washington i think this is one of his best movies yet he is sexy and so is his co stars the movie delivers great action suspense and surprises at the end	11
1	this is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s jessica lange truly deserved her oscar and tommy lee is excellent and of course powers booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies i ca n't even tell you how many times i have seen this movie and i will watch it again and again	11
1	most of us have seen the movie a great drama with great acting the dvd is a super clean transfer not any features to speak of but well worth the money invested very clean for a movie made so many years ago mann	11
1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times ' to reference hannah arendt this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	11
1	when i was little i remembered this show before i read the original cat in the hat i was enanmored by the animation of the great late chuck jones and the wonderful vocals of allan sherman as the cat in the hat if you see the credits theodore geisel had his hand in the music i recently bought the sing a long tape for my daughter grace who is 3 years old she requests to see it so hopefully the new dvd will be a great asset if it has extra features such as interviews or even behind the scenes of one of the best animation short classics ever	11
1	this is a classic christmas movie that you and your entire family are sure to love check this out i promise you that you will not be disappointed	11
1	jamie lee curtis plays a college co ed who and her friends throw a party on a train and a killer is amoung them a good slasher movie of the 80 's david cooperfield plays a sexy magician who forms his wonderful magic almost putting a spell on those ladies around him just remember jokes could kill you	11
1	this was purchased as a gift for a co worker who is adopting a child from china therefore i did not open it nor view it the recipient is now overseas picking up their daughter so i know they have n't had the opportunity to view it but being from sesame street what can you lose	11
1	i purchased the dvd for my adopted chinese grandaughter the whole family loves it	11
1	although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it this is a worthy effort marked by good acting direction technicals and an intelligent script although in a state of undress through much of the film kelly lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors and as so often with independent films all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative the desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed	11
1	this is a very dark film kevin reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a high school but this picture has nothing in common with to sir with love this is much more than a simple fairy tale carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for samuel jackson	11
1	just one of those classics i'm in the mood for once in a while and needed to replace my vhs version excellent copy on cd very happy with it	11
1	gibson and weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in indonesia they start living the expat life in jakarta and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule the movie is interesting on many fronts seeing the leads before they became megastars watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals and the history woven into the fiction supporting roles are played superbly as well it 's a great movie	11
1	to say this is a great film is probably an overstatement but it certainly is a great idea for a film gibson looks good weaver looks good hunt acts good weir directs good and the script is better than good much it 's a movie about ideas which earns high marks these days as so few flics can make that claim sure it stumbles a bit and the ending is purposely frustrating to carry forward the theme of white guilt and what then shall we do \? beyond all that it 's sensual and unpredictable and pretty damned intelligent seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill \? i ai n't see it for yourself	11
1	at the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope and has held up remarkably well despite a few touches of typical silent overacting heavy handedness still the 1925 hur belongs in any collector 's collection for its importance in film history not to mention the fact that it sealed mgm 's financial future so of course as of this writing the greedy oinkers at the studios have n't released it on dvd because it wo n't sell 4 million copies	11
1	all 3 wiwag are excellent this is more than just a well put together documentary its very moving because of the footage narration and music you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's after watching this you wish that things today were as they were back in those days not just baseball or sports but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds	11
1	why the record company would put this out on vhs and not dvd is beyond me especially considering its release date the ultimate would be \( and they have done it before see both the doors and sepultura dvd releases \) to take this and add to it live at brixton and put it all on one dvd since this does n't seem likely i suggest burn your own dvd and include not only ricochet and another bloody murder \( both left out \) but also mr bungle 's one music video release happily while stripsearch is not listed on the back of the vhs box it is included fnm videos \? great great great	11
1	even though this cinderella does not have the modern day movie magic \( in fact the sets are pretty corny \) that does not hurt or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl and looked forward every year for the airing of cinderella and the wizard of oz i was thrilled to have found this and would highly highly recomend it to any 40 woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this	11
1	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays	11
1	i 've always fondly remembered this movie bette midler and danny de vito have perfect comic timing d	11
1	i wo n't spend a long time explaining why i like this movie it 's just mindless fun and that 's all it needs to be a movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch and while it 's not the funniest or clever done comedy it 's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them plus that blob thing is just too freaking cool	11
1	oh yeah ! this is the film which set the standard for the women in prison genre the big doll house has everything you could possibly need if you are wip junkie cat fights \( one even takes place in the mud \) group showers sadistic guards scantically clothed gun toting babes lesbianism torture and pam grier oh yeah !	11
1	this is a must for purchasing dvds ! this is one movie that should be on dvd and still in the market ! this special edition different from the original dvd release the original dvd release as just the movie this special edition featured full length intewrviews with the cast from 2005 they were also pictures of the cast including the witch women they were n't ugly they were gorgous i do n't know why the director wanted to place those ugly masks over thier beauty i mean not all witches are ugly !	11
1	this is definitely not the typical look at the death camps this is a truely horrific look into the reality that was the death camps i wish it was longer but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours with the option of just listening to the soundtrack that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated	11
1	ive seen them live in norwich \( england \) and they were wonderful its a little slow to start but with wonderful light humour and sound that have to be heard live to belive a wonderful performance from 6 men who are all in their own way geourgus and extreamly talented you will leave tired for them i brought the dvd but it doesnt give you the real thing if their in a town near you go their worth every penny to see im not a dance person but oh how i wish now i was ! ! ! ! ! wonderful breathtaking and loud	11
1	every time i was flipping the channels and dutch was on i would end up staying on the channel and watching it i hated married with children so i was very suprised that i like this movie	11
1	the whole story would help us learn about the silent truth of female pleasure and sexuality the plot director actors and wonderful actress in overall are much more better than other explicit sex movies such as lie with me and especially intimacy	11
1	i have owned the video for several years and just purchased the dvd hannah and her sisters far exceeds anne hall as my favorite allen picture such a joy and the dvd is wonderful	11
1	this is a great movie for airplane buffs and those who enjoy comedy the filming and stunts are amazing to think this was the beginning of aviation a must see for anyone who appreciates comedy and or aviation a family favorite at my house one we view over and over the laughs never seem to stop	11
1	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays	11
1	this episode is a classic and is one of the best in the series it explores time travel and alternate time lines and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed	11
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	11
1	this is definitely screwball forget about anything resembling emotional reality this movie tromps along it 's own gay way a lot of the humor comes from the absurd manner cary and irene skip along in their own little la la land of wealth suspicion and inzaniness maybe not for everyone but cary gives one of his classic clueless performances	11
1	a little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both mr welles and the brazilian culture if there is one reason to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of the film a piece called quot four men on a raft quot it is the most beautiful black and white short film i have ever seen the love mr welles had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent	11
1	even though this is about 4 years old it is extremely halarious i 've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy the first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another i love this guy	11
1	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting \( and fast ! \) thx 1138 is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don't buy this dvd ! instead spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch 's involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars \( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover	11
1	i first watched this movie in a class a professor showed this movie and talked about oedipus complex i am not sure about this concept in it but sure enough this is an excellent movie	11
1	classic duke ! ! one of the best great cast opening scene remindes me of his early movie red river	11
1	what can i say if you like clint eastwood your going to like this movie i have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive in ! what memories	11
1	this movie is funny is hell three little words omg i was dying anyone know what song is playing when o'connel is in the car and he starts bumping it \? it sounds like rage but im not sure	11
1	only the lonely is a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes john candy ally sheedy maureen o'hara anthony quinn and milo o'shea the movie is about a irish american cop who lives in boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother does n't like this is a cute movie and i'm glad that they finally have put it on dvd	11
1	a group of male pals are at the wedding of a friend when he gets married jerry o'connell \( as quot michael quot \) and the rest of the men agree to never get married be single and be a quot tomcat quot horatio sanz \( as quot steve quot \) agrees too but the next thing they know he gets married too michael and steve are still friends everytime michael meets a woman bad luck happens and he gets in trouble with thugs or the law he 's a innocent as can be horatio sanz \( nbc 's saturday night live \) is hilarious and a delight in this film billy hufsey plays a quot pit boss quot	11
1	father goose was a movie i had seen and enjoyed a long time ago i rembered the name of the film but could not find it locally i contacted amazon its was in stock and i received it in a few days i was very pleased with your quick attention to my simple request i will be coming to you for future purchases	11
1	i love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together when one 's off screen you have the other to keep you entertained and when they 're on screen together it 's movie making at its best the plot itself leaves a bit to be desired the film 's production was stop and go for so long i heard that the director changed direction before it was finished my guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie particularly in regards to understanding benicio 's character properly nonetheless tommy lee jones and benicio del toro shine throughout p s being an animal lover i love that two leads in a movie are pro animal too	11
1	this movie was made mainly to potray the cycle of jesus' christ life and what he when through sacrificing himself for our sins people may think that it may be too religous for their standards but everyone has their own beliefs i highly recommend you view the film it is very innovating and emotional being a christian myself everytime i watch this film it uplifts my spirits and i hope it will do the same with yours	11
1	was forwarned about this one but wanted to experience it myself the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you great performances by all the actors the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage subtitles not to hard to follow overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to	11
1	cary grant was a great actor with countless memorable films although that this film is not amongst his very best it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure it is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some disney influence but grant offers us one of his typical \( in a good sence \) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs enjoy it	11
1	then this would be a really serious detective as it 's executed now it 's a superbly relaxed copper gets the villain with serious undertones cool	11
1	sadly the dvd does not contain the special features i had hoped for like deleted scenes or a commentary but that does n't detract from the movie which i think could n't be more perfect do you already love michael \? then buy this movie for your collection just to have andie mcdowell singing about miles ralph and bradley is worth the price of the dvd all by itself	11
1	funny crazy you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it its terrible b movie material but so bad it 's actually good	11
1	i purchased this a gift for a special friend as i know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape when she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment she has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience i myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre would only recommend for people who like broadway shows and musicals i'm glad i got this movie as a gift for her as i will now be remembered for many years to come	11

1	this was the first disney movie i watched as a child i would still watch it today disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using friendly animals while still keeping the main storylines intact thumbs up to the music love goes on and on is a moving piece and even hits my hard heart parents with younger children be warned some scenes may frighten them	11
1	i checked out the movie from my local county library and really liked it then i tried to purchase it from amazon and it was only available from canada the cost of the shipping was as much as the movie so i cancelled the order	11
1	i bought this dvd for my sister a fan of the movie she made me watch it with her on christmas the touching topic the much missed actors starring in the movie and the easy pace of the story left us feeling content refreshed and ready for more pumpkin pie	11
1	i do n't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles they seemed to have had a ball	11

1	i grew up in australia with these rankin bass christmas cartoons and i missed them when they were no longer shown i can only say that the dvd 's are fantastic and the cartoons are exactly as i remember them	11
1	being from midland you might say i'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie this movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released \( that 's how fast the bust hit \) terry jastrow \( who is from midland \) and his real life wife anne archer are great opposite each other on the screen while mary kay place provides great commentary on life in texas oil business	11
1	perhaps the only sculpture movie i ever saw very french she finally looses her mind at the end much angst	11
1	the characters are likable there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film but only about half of the scenes are necessary it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky gene is a funny guy there is no doubt about that but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly except for a few instances of harsh language and violence but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days it is worth a look but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story	11
1	this is one of my favorite movies ever it really captures life in the 1800 's slums and you really get attached to the characters there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams i 've seen this movie about 3 times and each time i see it it is just as good	11
1	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	11
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11
1	this version of pride and prejudice takes quite a few liberties with jane austen 's most beloved story but manages to endear itself in spite of that olivier 's darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with colin firth or matthew macfadyen but he does so well that you 'll be charmed by him in no time and greer garson 's lizzy is as spirited as you could wish the costumes are all wrong yes and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in regency dramas but once you get over that and immerse yourself into the story you 'll be swept away highly recommended	11
1	in 1969 an unknown soviet filmmaker mikhail kalatozov dared to tell an epic and tragic story concerned with the italian general nobile who tried to cross the north pole in a dirigible failing in his attempt the awful odyssey in the middle of this ironically polar hell when no one responded his sos calls make of this film one of the darkest movies ever filmed watch to sean connery as the artic explorer roald amudsen	11

1	i read a negative review of this show but i just watched it and it was better than foretold i expect it will do better than people think it 's basically a danielle steele novel come to life courtney cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a los angeles gossip magazine the other characters are troubled celebrities \( who have sex a lot \) the show feels very contemporary it is definitely a drama despite moments of levity it is basically a dramatic story in any case my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun	11
1	i urge everyone out there to download this episode ! this one totally rocks ! shep a wraith and kolya all in one episode ! any episode with shep \( joe flannigan \) and kolya are well worth watching ! download this and download every other stargate sg1 and stargate atlantis episode !	11

1	if you like gross out comedies this one is for you it celebrates the stoned peoples' view of the corporate working world and has anarchist toilet humor as a bonus	11
1	its easy to state facts when you talk about the quality of a power tool or a tv but when it comes to things like movies and music its all a mater of opinion my idea of a great movie might be your idea of the worst movie ever made so its not a good idea to buy or not buy a movie based on someones opinion of it i liked this movie in fact i just watched this movie 5 min before writing this if you are not sure if its your cup of tea rent it before buying it i seen it 10 times over the years and i still like it	11

1	billy elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class \( meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike \) this is the classic family does n't initially understand teacher believes in him screws up audition but spirit carries him through type movie it 's put together quite nicely and you never really know how it is going to turn out the transition from ballet dancing to tap jazz seemed to happen in one day which seemed jarring the beginning of swan lake with billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance 10 years or so later was a real feel good part of the movie	11

1	even though gordon lui is the main reason you 're buying this film the story is n't bad either excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences my only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes but that scene is not enough to tarnish this film this is a solid film	11
1	cult classic this is a loners movie i think we have all had times in our lives when we felt like kowalski thats what makes this movie so authentic what ever happened to barry newman does anyone remember petrocelli the tv series barry newman played a private detective and he was building his home block by block himself in the nevada desert \?	11

1	lisa rinna and gail o'grady become best friends not realizing that they share the same man ! both women perform very well in this movie i have been a big fan of both of them since melrose place and nypd blue sally kirkland also does a great job in this movie as gail o'grady 's mother this movie is filled with so many different ingredients intrigue lessons on overcoming fears and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy i 've seen it a few times and enjoy it more each time	11

1	my son being a hugh soccer fan liked it a lot i liked the longest yard story line	11
1	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	11

1	good news mike leigh fans this movie is now scheduled to be released on dvd on september 6 2005 according to amazon ! ! the movie is an excellent one sometimes \( unjustly \) considered one of leigh 's lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain a must for any and all mike leigh fans	11

1	i saw this documentary in a theater when it was first released in the 1970 's 30 years later many of the images remained etched in my mind i was shocked to see the living conditions of the miners and their families i was moved by their stories of struggle and perseverance we often forget that coal miners risk their lives every day so that we can stay warm and have light in our homes regardless of how you feel about unions this movie will make an impression on you highly recommended	11
1	we were amazed that this film was n't an award winner it is an excellent film and you might even see some style similarities between howard roark and frank lloyd wright	11
1	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere if you come across a copy of this buy it it is reminissant of american history x or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen aged boys comming of age while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen this will hit home for the rest of us drugs are bad ! !	11

1	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11

1	this movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way the movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure it is the very opposite of saccharine glop it is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie the movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters	11
1	sure the summary of the movie is n't eye catching to some but its a movie that should be seen damnit ! i mean it this is a story about a little boy named ingemar whos relationship with his loving mother slowly falls apart due to her sickness ingemar is soon sent away to live with his uncle and aunt for the summer this movie is charming and has a great cast of quirky charcters	11

1	i would have to say this was a brilliant movie i was highly entertained from this mr corman and hill flick beautiful women getting roughed up from the somewhat feminine guards pam grier gets your full attention	11
1	there are tons of women in prison films out there there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive however this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women who were full of one liners and crazy notions but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film lots of nudity violence bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house	11
1	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of everyone needs a maid only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	11

1	ah yes tarantino 's first script entitled true romance which he sold for 30 000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing you will notice in subsequent films and scripts is common for him certain terms will show up later on in other movies and as for reservoir dogs his second greatest film ever he used the money from true romance 's script to make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films including one or two from true romance	11

1	once again fox has cancelled a brilliant show while it is occasionally a bit off color the dialogue is brilliant but apparently people could n't follow the episodes so no one watched this great show and it was cancelled i have n't tried the download option but i highly recommend the show	11
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
1	this study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary long a student of modern art i learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself and enormously important to the on going study of women artists this is a work all admirers of modern art should view	11
1	this is a very enjoyable film in which everything from the acting to the music to the costumes is just right it depicts an earlier friendlier los angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back to an aviation nut such as myself it is heaven perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation the music fits the action so well in fact there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from rocketeer as his performance music most excellent ! the joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film i wish there were more movies like it	11
1	when this movie came out and i saw it at the movietheater you know the scene in the car where tine finally gets enough and hit him back \? everyone in the theater started yelling and screaming clapping their hands ! ! it was awesome and i will never forget it !	11
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature	11
1	while this movie was filmed in the coos bay oregon area i got to be an extra in it i had my doubts about it at the time but now that i have seen it i say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good movie some profanity and mild nudity not for the real youngins btw i am the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar the girl i was flirting with is my sister	11
1	let me be honest here i'm not a big fan of either nicole kidman or tom cruise however this movie is wonderful great story great characters the only reason i did n't give this movie five stars is the ending i think it could have been better great movie overall	11

1	i was so happy to recieve this movie its very rarely shown on tv i own my own thanks to amazon the music in this movie is magnificent it 's something to treasure for a life time glen miller was a great composer one of my favorites is moonlight serenade they just cant make music like this any more this is a great movie to add to your collection thank you amazo	11
1	this movie rocks man i'm so happy that they finally produced a stephen king script almost entirely true to the original story more than that it 's about 99 accurate they added some stuff like a new female character played by julie entwistle that was n't in the book but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending normally i'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first but this time i think i can confidently say that even non readers should like this movie it 's a masterpiece of suspense and gore rent it folks and call him the night flier	11
1	excellent price speed of delivery and quality i am very happy with this purchase	11
1	i have a friend who looked for a year for this movie on dvd in brick and mortar stores i ordered it for her and she had it in a week and by the next week she 'd watched it ten times its a very good movie	11
1	as others have noted arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball my man godfrey genre it is an effectively told outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies however without sir john gielgud \( a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood \) the film 's faults would be much more apparent he elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection he is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility and the title song is a classic	11
1	this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have 'a little' violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well i'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks i'm glad i did	11
1	early louis malle film based on the true life story of per jacques the film brings to life an understanding of true martyrdom this is the stuff of saints such as maximilian kolbe edith stein and pere jacques	11
1	this is an amazing service ! for only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment in this case it was hg wells great biography	11
1	i showed this to my 6th grade english class while we were reading miracle worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture they loved it and really learned a lot about cochlear implants i highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest	11
1	with c i already except for peter artinian the father of heather since 2003 and they have moved back to long island after 1 year in maryland deaf community all of the kids are probably mainstreamed instead of institutionalized in a residential school for the deaf this happened after 3 yrs of watching the trends and etc this documentary is excellent insight into turmoil between ci and culturally deaf community nina and others appeared on abc good morning america in 4 2003i also hear that josh aronson has released a follow up video of sound and fury anyway this sound and fury video is a must see	11

1	nice actor clark gable and doris day is very charming actress story is comedy touch and romantic picture is monocromatic but i feel flesh now this dvd is really excellent and i love it	11
1	this three part television production by the bbc released in 1999 is one of the finest films you 'll see in a while the acting is brilliant especially the performance by lindsay duncan the direction is extraordinary and the plot is most unusual \( if improbable \) the production is flawed only by a weak musical score the real question is how did this superb film ever get made in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos \? do n't miss it	11
1	a very enjoyable retelling of shakespeare 's romeo and juliet valley girl may be an extremely outdated movie but it still makes me laugh	11
1	when i watched this classic documentary i could n't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just would n't make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now	11
1	i like the story line of this movie but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven it was scary back then even with limited special effects and no graphic details watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time this film is in its own right a science fiction classic	11

1	i love this dvd ! i took karate for awhile and was pleased to find that the correct form is really emphasized in the kicks and strikes kathy smith brings her enthusiasm and experience and keith cooke and kelley roberts bring their knowledge of kickboxing in particular it 's a great workout	11
1	i think it is a great movie i bought it for my grandson he loved it	11
1	i am serious ! what is going on \? i look at myself now and do not recognise the guy in the mirrow he likes baseball and football \( american football \) he eats hotdogs and humburgers who is he \? have no idea but the worse part he loved this movie and he fell in love with ingrim bergman for her unbeliavable performance in it forget walter matthau forget goldie hawn they allways good ! but the way ms bergman rediscover for us the story of love when you not 15 anymore she really touched my hart	11
1	this movie hurt hurt in its absorption and hurt in its aftermath much like betrayal also starring jeremy irons but far far more devastating jeremy irons and juliette binoche were good damage all around	11
1	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11
1	so much is unknown about the valid attempts african americans made to build their own society 's during the 18th century forward this story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in america as free productive people ' my classes sat with eyes glued to the screen it was a horrific awakening for many of my students they were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives that african americans were a useless species well they now know the truth african americans were very diligent in building businesses places of worship homes etc which frightened the cacausion people of that era so they were destroyed and much hope with them	11
1	this movie shows the classic of russian history people interested in russian culture should definately watch this movie the plot of the story is really interesting	11
1	the combination of grant and kerr is wonderful on the screen i loved the mix of british humor and civility adding the dash of american brashness in robert mitchum one can enjoy watching the wheels fall off a very enjoyable movie	11

1	this is one of cinema 's great achievements a testament of the combination of elements \( subject visual style photographic image movement sound background music character montage \) are perfectly blended into a unique experience the new yorker print however is the worst copy of this film \( 16mm 35mm television screenings \) i have ever seen this was a copy with a lack of contrast extra noise on the track looking like a dub if only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice as it is enjoy what you 're stuck with but know there 's something better out there burt shapir	11
1	one of my all time favorite movies great story great acting great casting directing superb i cry everytime i watch it	11
1	i have loved this movie ro years and was thrilled to find it on amazon ! the story line is cute the acting is witty and if you have ever loved a musical this is for you ! there 's even an interlude with tom and jerry fun movie	11
1	this movie is great fun i remember watching it quite a few times when i was a kid and it is just as good now with this edition on dvd interviews with both corey 's let you know a lot about what happened between the two of them and how they became friends only disappointment is that corey haim comes across as a real stuck up snob type of person it makes you want to slap him because he seems so pompous corey feldman was great to watch and he has n't changed much in the last 18 years still a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoyed it when it was first released	11
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see	11
1	i surprisingly enjoyed this movie it is a little choppy and hard to understand what is going on at first but it is well worth the watch especially if you are a werewolf movie fan	11
1	this dvd is great it brings back all the memories of the holidays as a young child it is hard to catch these shows on tv as they only air once during the holiday season my daughters love them and i love seeing their reaction to the shows good buy	11
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
1	one of the must see christmas movies a family oriented movie that will rekindle the christmas spirit in everyone we have this on vcr tape and have watched it so much that we purchased the dvd version enjoy	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11

1	run time was 48 minutes a stellar documentary the download worked perfectly hope the review was helpful ty	11
1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature	11
1	despite it 's cover strangeland is not your typical horror movie the violence and mutilation are certainly here but the story behind it is the true heart of the tale i would not reccommend this for the squeamish or for children under 12	11
1	i loved it the movie arrived so quickly it was awesome it has brought back a lot of memories from my past thank you	11
1	i saw this movie when i was a student of latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of plautus 's plays brilliantly later i saw a stage prodction which i liked as well but no one can replace zero mostel he is one of the most naturally funny men in the world this is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun it is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time	11
1	this movie not only has some creative fight scenes it also has some very funny scenes as well some scenes will have you laughing and not like other kung fu movies that are stupidly funny this one is on purpose recommended highly !	11
1	darkness \( for those who wonder what the title film means \) is not the only time of the day tenebre 's would be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best selling author 's latest creation before you can even say what the this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer score to boost tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must see undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento 's career martin bouche	11
1	this is a great picture that i think grant morrison was imitating in his first issue of quot the invisibles quot it has cinematography and acting that repressed hollywood would n't get away from for another few years great ending that completely caught me off guard a very complete film	11
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie for those expecting a movie like a hard days night it is nothing like that this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady i wont tell u the ending but this is a true story all in all i thought this was a great movie you should defiently buy it	11
1	saturday night and sunday morning is very good social realist film finney is fantastic as rebellious youth arthur seaton having a sexual relationship with a married woman while also having a girlfriend portrays the sexual liberation of that time sex before marriage was becoming more and more common and this film represents this change in british society it was a well made film for the time and even today has an appealing quality	11
1	movie way ahead of its time the violence is cuttiing edge for its time a peckinpaw trait but is tame by today 's standard first rate movie i think and very underated i like warren oates and the support acting roles are well done i think well worth the money 5 star	11
1	even now the quality of music in this musical movie is excellent this brings back memories from my childhood \) great version of a classic	11
1	this movie is absolutely ridiculous ! i'm a super musical fan and i had a friend who kept telling me that xanadu was a movie you could n't turn away from whenever you caught it on tv boy was he right ! the music themes and special effects are totally 80s i was so pleased to see one of my all time favorites gene kelly as a starring character olivia newton john 's love interest michael beck was the guy from warriors another of my favorites this is a great movie	11
1	i had been searching for this dvd for some time i was happy to find it here and i am very pleased with it the sound is great and the video is very sharp i would reccomend it	11
1	great movie and musical numbers courtesy of quincy jones and the wonderful cast	11
1	my 3 1 2 year old little girl saw the charlie brown christmas on tv this year and loved it so much that i had to order it she watched it over and over and enjoyed it as much as i did over 40 years ago when i was a kid just goes to show that some things never get old and what a treat to be able to share it with her now	11
1	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	11
1	i'm dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page guess they just did n't get it this film is hilarious it 's clever witty and extremely entertaining travolta is classic as the pathetic gameshow host wannabe weather man the characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways it 's what makes the film such a classic comedy it 's unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it if you liked the big lebowski orange county the cable guy any film with esoteric characterization you will absolutely love this film it 's a dark comedy people get over it	11
1	emotionally shattering true life tale \( well sorta \) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he \( played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting \) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie \( and it is both and splendid examples of each \) instead resonates as a meditation on survival betrayal and accomodating and forgiving oneself a great film but only for mature audiences	11
1	instead of watching a documentary learning the history of brittan ireland in an entertaining way	11
1	this has got to be the best adaptation of jane eyre that i have ever seen and samantha morton is the reason she is positively delightful in the title role she has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll one of her lines of dialogue is incorrect she says i am not a beauty i am jane eyre truthfully speaking she is a beauty ! the story flows smoothly it 's not too long nor too short my favorite used to be the orson wells joan fontaine version but after seeing this british version i had to change you will not go wrong buying it	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
1	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is even for a grown up like me it could do without all the songs \( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing \) but it 's brisk double layered humor more than makes up for it kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly adults will pick up on the nearly sarcastic nearly risque dialog so rare in disney animated movies plus big foot dancing to 'stayin' alive' is just freaking hilarious basically it 's just a disney movie but it 's a great \( and severely under appreciated \) disney movie	11
1	great shows about binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself there 's a cycling champion vance legstrong who inspires him to succeed \( wonder who that character is modeled after \) 'operation dw' is about dw having surgery to get tubes put in her ears some really funny stuff in this one but that 's pretty much par for the course with the dw based episodes	11
1	after watching this video i examined the bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy it helps give the bible life so that you can see the reality of creation and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history this is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together	11
1	this 1960 effort by famed hammer productions of london england is one of their finest efforts and the greatest werewolf film ever made even by today 's standards the make up for the werewolf is eye opening and well worth the wait to see the movie is filled with underlying themes and for those who look it may be filled with a number of messages that are not readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative color photography normally a strong suit in hammer films anyway is among their very best the performance by the young oliver reed as the werewolf is filled with energy and passion a highlight of director terence fisher 's accomplished career if you only can have one werewolf film this is the one	11
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11

1	i loved this quirky movie i am glad to have it on dvd	11
1	the msde was received by due date in excellent condition	11
1	i love this movie maybe it 's because it seemed so risque as a kid or maybe it 's because jane hates it whatever it 's great fun sure the script leaves much to be desired and yea the special effects suck it was 1968 what do you want \? but that only adds to its charm it 's a funny movie more on the silly side this is true camp and if you like campy flicks this one has to be in your collection	11
1	this episode is a bit different than the others i have seen although i have not yet seen all of season 2 yet without giving anything away this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings additionally it has some inventive guest characters finally it presents some moral and ethical questions	11

1	'the curse of the grebes' is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb 'arthur changes gears' is also great he gets a bike he 's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he 's so worried about getting it dirty that he wo n't ride it	11
1	this is an ideal movie for home theatre i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl jason robards is utterly evil in this movie i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection	11
1	ok i 'll admt it when i first saw this movie i was only 6 or 7 i thought it dumb and pointless i also thought 'omfg ! what was that teacup thing for \? it was soooooo pointless this movie is stupid ' now i am 13 and i saw it again on abc family then i thought 'wow ! ' this movie is so cool ! i then understood what theteacups represented and everything i thought it was a great movie truely hilarious too of course it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world but i never found it until now this is a very cute movie and i really think anyone can enjoy it	11

1	i was never a richard burton fan until i discovered this movie richard burton 's acting in this movie is top notch burton is able to pull you into his character of british agent alec leamas and make it all believable thankfully the movie is in black and white because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film the dvd transfer and digital 5 1 sound are excellent it 's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect 's could be so entertaining but it is the question is will alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him	11
1	this has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and i was happy to see it available on dvd the story the script the direction and the acting are superb	11
1	probably one of steve mcqueens greatest movies only this one can happen	11

1	some of the best lighting i have ever seen on face of that hunk c tommy john peters is a genius	11
1	i have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and i wish it would come out in dvd my liking it has something to do with john 's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the direction of the characters through the machine once he damages the typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again you ca n't beat that we even get to see a perplexed robert wagner and the rest of a great cast	11
1	kickboxer 2 the road back deals with david sloan the brother of kurt amp eric sloan david is running his brothers kickboxer school tung po killed off van damme 's charcter for the first kickboxer i say good sasha mitchell is a lot better tung po can only regain his honor by fighting david since kurt is dead so david vs tung po with glue and glass is a bloody battle great movie the best in the series	11
1	however noone has commented on one interesting fact theres a episode missing ! the orginal miniseries is 10 hours long theres 2 hours missing and the part where they attack the processing plant is too soon unfortunately i do n't remember whats missing but it seems that it belongs before the first ep presented on this dvd set !	11
1	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci fi such as star trek \( the newer ones \) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was v the final battle is the second installment of the saga so make sure to buy v the miniseries first the storyline is good and characters are likeable and three dimensional i highly recommend it for any sci fi fan for old hands it is a fun movie and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	11

1	one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his family simple straightforward action that never lets up the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years	11

1	dr smith and the robot go hog wild switching personalities and swapping insults this is a great episode	11
1	tangled is actually a really good movie you have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie	11
1	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine	11
1	i saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head it 's a beautiful english production that has a definite melancholy bittersweet flavor that 's missing from other adaptations really worth seeing it is a kid friendly version \? not really but smart teens may enjoy it great performances from ralph richardson peter sellers and fiona fullerton as alice	11
1	seller was very timely in sending the dvd and the quality was as described	11
1	haha now all the other reviews say this movie is cheesey now maybe its cause i get scared really easily but this movie just had something about it that scared the crap out of me i couldnt even finnish i	11
1	the more historically accurate the film the more it tends to drag the molly maguires certainly passes this test ! still it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong headed response which brought them into conflict with the church	11
1	ok this is like so many other sci fi movies of the 80 's \( and the second of three underwater action movies that year \) that you always feel like you have seen it before the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze as two crew members drink from it they get very sick and why not it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster not the greatest but i had fun watching it and if gore and f x 's are your thing you 'll love it	11
1	i love anakin skywalk	11
1	love sam elliott even when the material is n't tops he is ! this one is really good	11
1	this is the best of the best hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will ever see colm wilkinson lea salonga michael ball are all amazing fabulous talent great singing	11
1	wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember but still a great movie especially with the deleted scenes they are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old but still allot of fun to watch	11
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
1	seriously one of my favorite movies of all time thank goodness for 1980 's rewinds kate hudson 's character is ridiculous in the absolute best sense of the word oh and martha plimpton never ages she 's a freak of nature now get off the computer and let 's go party risa garcia style f yeah	11
1	great movie excellent condition and as always shipped quickly and in good shape	11
1	i saw this movie when i was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago i ordered a copy through amazon and when i watched it i remembered everything in the film especially queenie hiding in the woods i like this as it was directed by charles kaufman brother of lloyd kaufman who made the toxic avenger i give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a troma inc release this is one of the best troma films i have seen	11
1	the fly is fantastic and well worth a watch goldblum 's performance is also just outstanding for a really cool creepy interesting and engaging film this is the one fly 2 not so good so dont bother the extras and presentation on the dvd is also great adding to the package here definately worthwhile if a little cronenberg splat isnt gonna offend and watching what could have been a really tacky cheap project done really really well sounds good and if it doesnt get over yourself cause it is	11
1	this movie really surprised me the first time i saw it there is much more depth to the story than you would think martin short is very funny nick nolte is great and the little girl is adorable i highly recommend it	11
1	this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source frankly you forget that it is in black and white format	11
1	my side of the mountain is a terrific and educational movie i ca n't agree with some of the negative reviews here this is an interesting movie the whole family can watch together little sam gribley is a walking encyclopedia this movie would be good for classrooms watch it and learn ! i'm going for the novel	11
1	i do n't have television have n't for 11 years when i learned cbs was allowing free viewing over the internet i checked it out and started watching episodes of csi csi ny csi miami and ncis i found ncis to be my favorite and this particular show dead and unburied is my favorite so far i enjoy the light heartedness of ncis so i decided to download this episode from amazon unbox i really wish amazon unbox would allow me to burn shows i 've purchased as it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer when unbox expands this service to allow me to burn dvds i will likely purchase many more shows this way i like selecting individual shows	11
1	with a well crafted script good actors at the heights of their powers and brisk no nonsense direction emma thompson has done better work since but kenneth branagh has n't unfortunately too bad really branagh may still be a pretty good director but i think working with emma is what lent him an appeal and warmth on screen that he has not been able to recapture his hamlet was glossy chilly unpleasant and too old nevertheless i'm grateful that we at least have this as well as his henry v and much ado about nothing	11
1	i dont remember watching he man growing up but i think i saw this movie i watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical and i was wrong the preview really drew me into the movie before i watched it it was pure fun and an excellent sci fi movie dolph lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie thanks dolph ! where the heck are you these days \? i didnt check all reviews but at the very very end of the movie skeltor comes on and says i 'll be back ha ! guess that movie never happened	11
1	i used to love this movie as a child now my goddaughter and i watch it together this dvd has 3 different shows on it all with a great moral	11
1	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness welles is excellent as edward rochester the tormented master of the house joan fountaine is wonderful as jane look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles this material has been done many times but watch this version	11
1	the movie is a bit dramatic at times but those who have studied the doolittle raid and the treatment of the 8 men captured know it does not tell the american public enough about the terrible way humans treat other humans if the americans had been able to know how badly their prisoners were being treated the japanese island might not be there today read four came home for the best view or study other exerpts of various items on the internet i am writing about dean edward hallmark a graduate of paris junior college and one of the three who were executed	11
1	this is a classic gangster movie already anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection	11
1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	11
1	where are the dvds \? i'm still waiting ! i want it all but especially the second season i 'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc i want good quality discs not too many episodes on each please however i 'll take what i can get just put it on dvd please !	11
1	what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person how can you criticise someones life story \? to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp \? i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise	11
1	this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have 'a little' violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well i'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks i'm glad i did	11
1	vincent price at his best ! ! ! i was amazed at his interpretation of usher it was very much like the hyper sensitive fellow of poe 's tale ! ! ! the ending was shocking i recommend this item to everybody good acting very good indeed	11
1	see the digital rendition of the historical zapruder film from november of 1963 there 's no way it could have been only one gunman	11
1	i enjoy watching this movie over and over again with my family and friends best purchase i ever made	11
1	madonna gives a stunning performance explicit similated sex and graphic language we really enjoyed the concert this is defininatly one of her best now if we can get the blond ambition tour from japan and the usa i would be very happy 5 star rated i own this disc	11
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11
1	just got done watching the show and it was awesome of course i had to download the tool how else do you get started \? once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when i was ready note to self get cable dsl is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome no commercials ! i did n't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it	11

1	bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining	11
1	this episode is a bit different than the others i have seen although i have not yet seen all of season 2 yet without giving anything away this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings additionally it has some inventive guest characters finally it presents some moral and ethical questions	11
1	but it 's the core 25 and if you look at this as its own piece then you 'll be satisfied the visuals are great gary cooper is great and ayn rand 's premise is all here and for those of you picking apart rand 's philosophy and its role in architecture yes the movie is an exaggeration the book is too that 's the point	11
1	i recently read the fountainhead and atlas shrugged for the first time and found this version of the fountainhead to be the best old movie i 've seen granted i do n't watch a tremendous number of old movies but i really enjoyed and recommend this movie	11
1	i 've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd to ad to my collection again if you like bill murray you 'll like this movie also randy quaid is hilarious murphys law at it 's best ! cracks me up just thinking about it	11

1	this movie is a classic we owned it on vhs and the tape finally fell apart so i ordered it for our family for christmas good for all ages nice night of entertainment for all of us	11
1	great movie ! pretty funny and it has a wonderful moral to it but i wo n't give it away ! watch the movie ! you 'll love it	11
1	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11
1	this movie has all the best comedians in it ! remember norm macdonalds character from saturday night live news note to self and his tape recorder \? this movie is his saturday night live parable chris farley adam sandler \( guest appearnce \) even little gary coleman its hiliarious and quotable	11
1	monkey business is one of the cutest movies i have ever seen and it 's just so funny to see cary grant and ginger rogers take the youth serum and act like children and they were great and also the monkey were absolutely adorable ! this movie is recommended highly	11
1	jlo finds out that she cant run forever from her abusive husband so she learns krav maga and gives him a a s kicking to remember	11
1	i thought this was an excellent movie it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time i just could n't stop watching it it has an excellent plot that i think a lot of people can understand it gives you an idea of what goes on when a husband becomes violent with his wife and starts to abuse her	11
