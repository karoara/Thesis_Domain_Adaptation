0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	0
0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0
0	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
1	fit well great for all kinds of athletic workouts i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	0
1	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet	0

1	i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much	0
1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned excellent quality and fit	0
1	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company	0
1	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai	0
0	i am a 38 ff and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back	0
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems this time was different they sent the wrong shorts i paid the shipping to send them back i asked please send the right shorts they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid and that was that certainly not satisfied	0

0	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night	0
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	0

0	i wish there were 0 star although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them after searching a lot for buying a present for my sister 's birthday i found this sandal and i decided to buy i ordered it on march 9th and after 20 days ! ! still i have n't received them ! ! ! ! ! ! i am getting my money back not only i have wasted my time but also i should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late ! ! ! ! conclusion these sandals are very beautiful but never fall for them	0
0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0

1	as a new 36dd \( ca n't wear underwire \) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market for the past 5 years \( since my surgery \) i 've been searching for the perfect bra i have finally found it !	0
1	i liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic but otherwise they fit perfectly	0
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0
1	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional love them strong and tough not to heavy has good grip on snow	0
1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0

1	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim \( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we 've had trouble in the past \) several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included these tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen no more headaches in trying to find our luggage	0
1	better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures buttons are fairly intuitive instructions are understandable and there 's nothing like being the first kid on the block with a new toy getting all sorts of comments about my picture show	1
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
1	this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment i do n't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera coupled with an l series zoom lens	1

1	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf 10 when this case was on back order it was terrrible so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased the camera fits perfectly into the case and although it is described as a soft case it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk	1
1	bought these binoculars for my husband he loves them they are very powerful and he loves the way they feel not too heavy he can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees	1
1	excellent clarity even on cloudy days i have had others that cost 4 times the price and would not match the quality of these comes complete with with case caps and neck strap	1
1	i purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera this is my second point and shoot digital camera since i have abandoned film it is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures it has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me i have used it on an entire week long vacation without re charging it kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less	1
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great unlike the century wide angle lens this is fully zoom through lens is 8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm also very little barrel distortion in all a great lens only drawback is that it 's a big \( heavy \) lens but then hey it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder	1
0	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera the picture quality was not good at all i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera it stopped working and i did not use it that much i now own the sony cybershot dsc w50 that takes great pictures i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006	1
0	i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case	1
1	this monopod does a great job for my camera you have the quick easy off it attatches to your camera by a screw and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly i wanted a nice inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense i have a canon 35mm and i recently purchased a 75 300 zoom lense for it and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot if i knew then what i know now i would buy it again nice product	1
1	it 's easy to use and makes good pictures easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e mail	1
1	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
0	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	1
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used the delay between pictures is incredibly long the lens shutter does n't open properly \( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems	1

0	should have listened to the reviewer before me unit arrived dead neither ac power or car charger worked tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work	1
0	poor focus blurry awful optics do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features	1
0	very disappointed in this product and amazon 's response to the problem item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed they have told me they ca n't supply the missing part \( the metal neck strap showing in the photo \) as item comes from a freight forwarder i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country	1
0	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger i think it 's odd as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery i do n't know whether the dock works okay because i did n't get that far this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one now i have to buy another battery	1

1	i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex s500 that was sadly stolen from me it 's the same size which i love and as convenient which is awesome it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken it 's one of my favorite things ever	1
0	it worked fine the first week then the focus stopped working i sent it to repair it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working i sent it for repair for the second time it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working also it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony ! ! ! they make you wait over an hour ! ! ! si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for ! ! ! sony repair reference number e3317596	1

1	with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic and i have great faith that they will keep it there reliable and more professional than a brick	1
0	i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work this is terrible terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
0	the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera	1
0	great camera for the price but i guess you get what you pay for bad warranty	1
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier professional medical photographer	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	this digital camera is awesome i have no problem with the batteries i made sure i put the good batteries in \( no cheap ones \) i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march awesome digital camera you wo n't be sorry on this purchase	1
0	i ordered the original item used it for about a week then sent it to my son in new hampshire he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up never to function properly again i ordered a replacement checked it out and sent it on to him with the same result less than 15 minutes of use it quit working i thought the unit was nice compact and fairly easy to use but with two malfunctions in two cameras i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone	1
1	this is a great bag it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well i'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else	1
1	started to by a less expensive bag last january \( dec now \) and i'm shure glad i did n't for the money this bag is a good one it 's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly the tripod holder on top has been real convenient	1
0	i selected a sony vf 30cpkxs polarizing filter but it took me to this page where i got a sony vf r30nkx 30mm neutral density filter there is a big difference may 9 2006 i hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception	1
0	i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc they let me down as well when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit this will come back and bite them in the behind	1
0	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
1	this is the perfect camera for me i take alot of close up detail shots and the images come out great it is smaller than my old g3 \( which i loved but was pretty chunky \)	1
0	this product did n't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit the sound from the ecm hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself i wish i had not bought it	1
1	if you have the big lenses \( 400mm f 2 8l is usm or even the 70 200mm f 2 8l is usm \) this is totally worth the addition the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f 2 8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges check compatability on canon 's website you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	ok i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good	1
1	nice portable background support kit stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution easy and quick to put up i put it up by myself with very little effort all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting	1
0	this is a good charger quick and portable but the battery life of the battery sucks !	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	i have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250 00 by this date this lens cost is usd 95 00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20 00 that means you will pay usd 365 00 for a 8x zoom camera for that price or less you can get a 10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200	1
0	not worth the 10 i paid especially when i had to spend 7 to ship it ! !	1
1	this lens is amazing nothing escapes it it 's like a black hole clearly the best lens i have ever owned it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera it comes with a beautiful case a hood and a tripod mount on the lens believe me you will need it i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great i will now get to work reading the small manual it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings wow !	1
1	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
1	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it super easy to use good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket	1
0	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
1	the changer performs perfectly i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original about one foot shorter other than that it is fine i gave my original changer to my daughter whose charger died just before leaving the country	1
1	after using both lenses i think this is much better here are my reasons 1 f 2 8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate 2 bokeh is much better in this one 3 macro is slightly better on this one 4 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size 5 is is not very crucial in 24 50 range	1
1	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	1
1	the np bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature	1
1	sony has done it again ! fast charging and long lasting this battery is perfect for my sony cyber shot camera !	1
1	though the lenses for my nikon d50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass this size 52mm was what was specified for my d50 and it fits perfectly as it should i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller if you are new to digital slr 's like i was then get this filter to protect your lens and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens	1
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked the older model is far superior this camera is slow to focus slow to shoot and slow to save i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition \( indoor medium light \) on the automatic setting all 5 pictures turned out different only one turned out clear i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with	1
1	got this camera because a friend had a similar one the blue tooth feature is just great you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size all in all a great buy	1
0	there 's little more to say great item almost a must have but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal	1
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
0	this is not at all suitable for young children it 's awkward and difficult to use we 're sending it back totally inappropriate for children	1
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
0	well at least some stuff is cool free cam bag the pics come out excellent the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to freeze up bottom line i recommend at least researching other brands of mini tapeless cams but this one isnt worth 159 or whatever its trash go for something else	1
1	me encuentro muy conforme con el producto es de excelente calidad y muy buen precio amazon es para mi el mejor sitio para la compra de cualquier producto	1
1	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry based on my trial use of the vx2000 that was three years ago this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production plus i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves	1
0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect forthe dx759	1
0	loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it two years later my feelings are very different batteries need to be recharged constantly camera rarely turns on after being off it 's dock for more than an hour all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying zoom is worthless pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated flash is also way too bright half of my pictures are annoyingly white looking because of this definitely going with canon on my next purchase	1
1	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
1	i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon so far the lens has performed as expected it is solid and well built sticks slightly when zooming through 200mm images are crisp and focus is sharp working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick overall good lens for 200 if you have more money then a lens with image stabilization \( is \) would be the way to go	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
1	yep it extends the eyepiece out a little bit which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display but it also distorts the view in an annoying way i use mine on occasion but not all the time	1
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	1
0	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
0	the camera \( canon s 80 \) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card much less a second battery pack or the charger i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories total waste of	1
1	this is my first camcorder so i do n't have much to compare it to but i 've enjoyed it so far it 's easy to use the picture quality seems high the only minor problem i 've found is with the headphone input had to try three different sets of headphones before i could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is	1
1	i do weddings portrait and outdoor photography and i do n't see any reason why i 'd ever switch from the d70 \( other than the d80 \) this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point do n't be scared by the 6 1 mp i print at 20x30 all the time w out any problems i 'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
0	cons only no pros the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash	1
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	1
1	purchased as a gift and well received seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner runs everyday all day and no problems encountered displays vacation pictures clearly like that it is big enough to view across the room frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 model previously purchased	1
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel 71 of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 \( as of today \) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with 5 megapixels i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
0	hello all lens hoods are pretty much a necessity but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used unlike other hoods that screw on this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one and release the clips this leads to problems of alignment meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right although it 's a pain and i hate i do n't really have another alternative either go w o a hood or take this one either way guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one	1
1	i have received this camera for serveral weeks it 's a good long zoom digital camera i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized the picture is sharp image quality is good however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 when the iso is 400 or above i can see the noise and the picture lose detail but every camera has its own defect overall i am satified with this camera and i am enjoying using it to take pictures	1
1	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1
0	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son i was surprised at how well cheap it appeared we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first then it worked for about 10 minutes then it never worked again and we had to return it amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly we ended up buying the dgx 5 1 mp from a local store i it 's place it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth not a professional photography instrument but a pretty decent unit for him	1
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected and was just what i wanted very small but versitle large screen very satified with my purchase	1
1	i'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is much better than another but for my canon ef s 10 22mm on a 20d i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded canon it fits fine does n't interfere with the lens hood looks clear seems to attenuate that nasty ultra violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all protects the front element what more would one want	1
0	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver \( the smallest one you can find \) to achieve it unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to	1
0	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont then after a week it just stops working dont get it theres no flash whatsoeve	1
0	we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new and one day the lens just wo n't open it lights up then after a few seconds it turns off automatically called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair the price they 've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon ! i 'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point so i'm expecting a believable quote for repairs i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera	1
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly	1
0	the bag is suppose to hold two cameras i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl	1
0	fuji fails to honor warrantee do n't buy from themdo not buy the fuji digital camera they charged me for a fix within the warrantee period their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee	1
1	have had good luck with these batteries they last for a long time first time with amazon and it was a good experience will use them again	1
1	i have been using kodak cameras for years this is my third kodak digital camera it does everything including taking excellent close up wildlifephotos it is as easy to use as a point and shoot however it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera it is well worth the money look no further this is the camera for you	1
1	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1 40 my d50 flies on it	1
0	a great idea poorly executed the construction is cheap the screen is marginal at best but worst of all it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras i have on hand or a usb card reader a piece of junk that i am now returnin	1
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes we purchased it for a cruise because we wanted to carry on the camcorder and have it protected but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	1
0	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player when i first received the kit i charged all of the batteries upon first use i only got 7min out of each battery when i got 20 hrs from the batter sent with the player i learned online that the batteries still have their charge but due to the battery 's memory effect or voltage depression my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much juice is left in a battery do not buy this kit	1
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it not kidding ! when i first got it i called kodak and they told my son \( who is knowledgeable in this stuff \) how to reset the printer we reset it and it worked for awhile then it would n't work any more and i did away with it no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	1
1	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 it 's perfect and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast i received it within a few days	1
1	it is extremely easy to use hard to figure out the menu but once that is done there is no problem takes beautiful pictures great for action shots as well seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in	1
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1
0	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
1	love this battery long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
0	yes it does provide a bit more eye relief and can make it easier to see the whole frame \( by making it smaller \) but there is a major problem with this the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses	1
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	1
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	1
0	it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w b	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are 2 9 x4 2 x1 8 \( wxhxd \) it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit	1
1	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas	1
0	ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality its fuzzy im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back i hope this has helpe	1
1	do n't believe the marketing kodak does i was using only kodakfilms for nearly 5 years i recently switched to fuji based on some online reviews i was pleasantly surprised at the results i highly recommend this film	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1
1	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	1
1	yes this is a very good first camcorder i am a first time user of any cam corder i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting but the software is harder to use that movie maker but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic enjoy do	1
1	i like this small thing work great and cheap	1
1	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed it is easy to use in fact i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand made craftsmanship of the watches its f2 5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you	1
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself the pictures are clear and crisp if i had to buy another i would purchase the same	1
0	the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	1
0	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels i would not recommend this item at all	1
0	decent camera but not great shark mode is nice housing looks good but mine leaked at 20 ft camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present next time i will buy a housing for a better camera canon has some nice ones	1
0	be warned if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing sharing whatever ca n't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks but could n't find one i searched all over asked in several places on the apple web boards talked to the 'geniuses' at the apple store this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive talk about crazy !	1
0	bought the camera charger and the kit as part of the deal every thing looks good except the missing npf 50 battery requested for a replacement in the replacement kit also battery was missing returned both the items 59 99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	love my new jvc everio the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files \( mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio \) i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2 0 which supports this new file type natively it has made editing a breeze	1
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product great quality nevertheless	1
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why 's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one you ca n't go wrong with this camera highly recommended	1
1	it 's a pretty convinient bag i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28 75 lens a canon 70 300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet keys etc the only drawback of this bag is you can not put in big lenses the canon 70 300 is the limit but if you only have a limited gear collection you need to give it a try	1
0	like another reviewer 's my experience has been mixed i use this remote with the d50 sometimes the remote works then it goes on strike then suddenly it works again same distance and angle from the camera i changed the battery same result i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable	1
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless should have sent it back	1
1	i bought two one for me one for my daughter it is compact user friendly it has nice sized screen it comes with a charger \( i 've been told that some do n't \) 6 2 mgp video with audio all this for a very nice price	1
0	i have had several people take my pictures at first everything is fine the pictures are ok the next day my face looks like a pile of baby vomit it is soooo blury then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury i tried fixing it online \( like on the program for the camera \) and it would not work i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks it lasts maybe 3 1 2 hours this camera should be 99 00 trust me people if i could rate this thing at a zero i would it is not worth it however a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5 an awesome little camera	1
1	i was really happy with the telescope it was a good buy too i bought one for a friend als	1
1	excellent choice to make a great job	1
1	received camera exactly as described easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again thank	1
1	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful esp with macro shots highly recommend	1
1	i have n't used it much but the few photos i have taken are excellent i'm not a photography expert so i 'll leave the technicalities to others telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount the high quality of this lens as with the wide angle is obvious comes with caps and a storage bag	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find just the right spot i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise i live in a single story 2100 sq foot house i should have returned it right away but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time now 10 months later the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor i love having the video monitor though so i will look for a different brand	1
1	it was everything it was reported to be it works very well we take it on every trip we take	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
0	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box it takes the output of the camcorder \( composite rca or s video \) and compresses that to mpeg 2 \( dvd \) or mpeg 4 \( or divx \) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd \( mpeg 1 or mini dvd \) look for plextor 's m402u box unless you really want to deal with 3 125 mb of data per second \( 25 mbps \) or about 180 mb per minute or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link get the m402u your options will be greatly expanded and you wo n't tell the difference by looking	1
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	1

0	the roll of paper that i recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper i am trying to get it replaced but adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old i was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues	1
1	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it this was the exact replica and it works great	1
0	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does i thought it was a pretty good deal for 26 i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	1
1	i purchased this for my canons500 i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new good quality construction and a great look feel	1
0	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time at first it worked great then after 2 3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 we returned it to get another and it did the same thing we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal i do not recommend this to anyone	1
1	for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times this flash solves the problem i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience items were sent quickly	1
0	just returned the mobicam had poor reception even in adjacent room ! smallo screen not stable falls easy seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house !	1
0	horrible camera barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz drained the batteries within a few pictures so not worth more then the cost of a disposable ! ! sorry kodak but i 'll stick with the good ol' reliable sony	1
1	kodak v705 black small can carry in pocket wide angle lens great for group photos fast start up time video mode is easy built in mic picks up all the sounds camera can stitch 3 photos together great for vistas i am happy with this camera bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it kodak makes easy to take photos weak flash try not to be more than 6 8 feet away or use photoshop on photos	1
0	i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more then nothing for the rest of the roll we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it should have bought a disposable one	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	i bought this camera for my sister as an early christmas present thinking i would need some time to set it up for her well in less then 30 minutes i was ready it 's a awesome camera i was impressed of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone great photos from very close to far away i would recommend this camera to anyone	1
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards i bought it for future use as i do n't currently have the lens yet but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too	1
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs this hood how can you pay 75 for a great prime lens and 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging how to i recharge it \? nothing tells me how to recharge it so far money wasted unresponsive to my emails	1
0	i agree with m arse with the 2star rating i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers i 've read that it has much better shutter speed recommended \? \?	1
0	very dissappointed my son \( i bought this for them \) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used audio just static and noise i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work try telling this to me before i purchase thank you this is the last i purchase equipment on line i will stick to books thank you very much	1
1	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me 1 \) the battery is the canon genuine nb 1lh battery \? 2 \) the camera case is canon psc 50 case \? thank you in advance	1
0	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
0	this is a terrible product 1 the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use 2 the pictures are extremely poor 3 the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient w	1
1	i love this camera i have now traveled all over the usa some places in europe and will be using it in china lens is excellent i wish it were lighter weight but ca n't have everything and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else	1
1	this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus	1
0	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i'm going to europe \( two days after it died \) now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off grrrrr ! !	1
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
0	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1
0	i took it straight out of the package plugged it in for a charge charger never reached green ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later customer service was not the best i 've had do n't make the same mistake keep looking	1
1	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera i love this camera i think it takes awesome pictures	1
1	my bother in law and i went to africa on safari last year we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well	1
1	very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival	1
0	this is a 1 2 volt battery charger useless for anything that requires aaa 1 5 volt batteries	1
0	ok maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera both my 30d and rebel xt if i am lucky enough it will fall off get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory	1
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built they were not interested in even trying to help i hate it when companies only care about their profits	1
0	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
0	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else it does not include a docking station you have to shell out more money for that option i dont think so	1
1	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
0	i loved this camera when i got it but after three months the lens would not close it makes grinding noises the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again i am very disappointed in this camera	1
1	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased at this time i have not gone under water with it	1
1	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony it works great had no problems so far it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv	1
0	poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out	1
1	i am starting my career as a professional photographer and i have n't had any problems with these filters they come in a nice case and are easy to attach to my lenses	1
1	goo	1
1	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
1	this is a nice bag but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag i ca n't even get the thing in the bag it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories good quality	1
0	i just got this printer dock with a camera and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried when it does feed it ends up jamming i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	1
0	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
0	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
1	third camera from kodak easyshare great performance and pics slendor size	1
0	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
0	the case fits like a tight glove i do n't like that the camera was hard to get in and out and did n't have any pockets for straps or batteries	1
0	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future the lens adapter by itself does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else \? \? \? ben boykin las cruces nm 8801	1
1	i have the white one \( black was unavailable at the time of purchase \) 1 the camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet it is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle 2 durable no scrapes or scratches in 7 months 3 have n't missed the belt clip option its small enough to fit in my pocket4 well constructed durable people think its some sort of ipod case holder	1
1	having just gone back to using a film camera from digital \( my wife still uses digital \) i have found this to be an excellant camera so far i have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect i would recommend it	1
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them	1
1	my sony dscw100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby	1
1	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price	1
0	in an email adorama specified that the filter diameter was 28mm on the amazon com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 of the purchase price an amount i feel is beyond absurd i can buy this locally for a lot less \( even though i would have to pay sales tax \) buyer beware	1
1	fast delivery great price i would buy from them again thanks	1
0	rated one star for the lack of value you can buy the same canon brand case for under 14 and a higher capacity imho better albeit non name brand 1200mah battery for under 10 from amazon the neck strap is not worth the difference	1
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense it sucks i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality if you get closer than five inches the pictures messes up i 've had no other problem with the hardware though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed oh and night photos also suck big time even with the flash on	1
1	from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colorscons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrastyfor myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the 1 6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great except for the touch screen feature that takes a little getting used to especially when accessing the special features \( such as fader effects \) while filming the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer all in all it is a good product just takes some getting used to	1
1	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible \( has a divider you can place where ever you want \) so you can secure cameras however you wish	1
0	yes i have to agree with the previous review it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much and just chalk it up to extra protection but that seems to be all it 's good for	1
1	great camera only bad thing are the batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures and has some good features	1
1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	1
1	i got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures its also very sleek and small	1
1	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy it has both point and shoot and slr features you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography the software was easy to use easy to set up and it works well on my mac it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name	1
1	the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility the stabilization aspect is a great help although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt	1
1	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with	1
1	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
0	very good product very satisfied the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette	1
1	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
1	we use our batteries a lot no problems works as advertised	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
1	for its size and price this little light ca n't be beat very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors i think this is a must have for camcorder owners my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long term return	1
1	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1
0	i bought two one time but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them and the jvc even would not cover the charge	1
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price \( if you get a good deal \) photo quality is poor and screen is quite small \( 3x5 \) navigation is not overly complicated but buttons must be pushed hard to work it did work perfectly fine took sd card even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame but because of the poor quality of the photos i do n't suggest buying	1
0	if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos it does work well for video the sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself is a disappointment	1
0	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
0	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1
0	i 've never ordered anything and been this disappointed i ordered two of these and both did n't work i contacted the company 's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support i will never buy another product from this company again	1
1	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1
1	the flash works very well i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash it works great i am very happy with this product	1
1	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration	1
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder \( sony hdr hc1 \) it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod	1
1	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased the pictures are wonderful the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem free we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do the slideshow feature is wonderful as well everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed to be sure they are expensive but worth the cost we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right	1
0	i was down in antarctica when i turned on the camera and it said lens error after a day of missing some of the best pictures of emperor penguins with my 8800 i twisted the lens and got it to work the same thing happened to me in bolivia just after the warranty expired i called nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera do a google search of lens error and nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience this is my third and last nikon	1
1	i'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power it 's compact not heavy has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right in addition to the light output the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced an excellent feature getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally brochure reading averse twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment but had given up both i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt there is no clip on the case itself holds only the camera not even space for a spare battery or memory card \( i 've heard the case will darken your camera but i did n't end up using the case \) the neck strap is not useful it 's too long at '34 inches if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it \( the canon camera rocks however	1
1	this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a 4 star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it 's a good product	1
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	1
0	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great but then i realized it would only display 142 images i worked with technical support for several months \( they are not the speediest or most helpful \) i resized renamed restructured the photos tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course only to recieve another with the same problem i would n't recommend this purchase	1
1	your site was the only place where could find a replacement for my lost nikon uc e6usb cable for my nikon coolpix 3100 even nikon could not satisfy my request thank youcynthia valesi	1
1	i am not much of a photographer i found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great believe me it 's the camera the stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time i can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily i'm thrilled you do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb memory card when you buy the camera	1
0	it looks cool and it 's easy to carry but that is about it camera is slow and pictures are often blurry sorry i wasted my money on this one get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue	1
1	of course it had to be kodak no matter what people say i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera i 've found this camera to be a real warrior last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better photo cuality its very good and colors are great no excesive blue or red in your pics night photo taking its excelent in close shots 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater but its nothing a 25 batterie charger can`t solve sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje	1
1	after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month it has met my expectations and perhaps then some after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150 ish range i partially regret spending what i did it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth bottom line no complaints with it	1
0	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
0	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with so i decided to get this new one i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera but compared to a similar sony model the canon was noticeably louder while operating way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	1
1	i really enjoy this camera mine has the carl zeiss vario tessar lens it works grewat be sure to use the memory stick pro media a great reasonable priced camera	1
1	excellent product for the price pictures are not that good but you ca n't ask more for this price	1
1	very clear bright day strong magnification quality seems to be good very well priced at around 100 00 i will know more over the passage of time my firstimpression is good mj schra	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	it got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it \( a month or so later \) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly a huge disappointment and waste of my money	1
1	it is a great camera very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances grainy pic in dim light go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car	1
0	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets quite small for the price just paying for the name on the bag	1
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
0	if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool it 's ok but if you are the open water diver please do n't buy it i try it yesterday it will not work after 10m 33ft it will show the red screen and count down timer it scare me and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday 's dive it 's really disappointed to me	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
1	this camera works well except that the shutter speed is a bit slow the image quality is decent the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient the camera is pretty sturdy i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine	1
0	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
0	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
0	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months i 've called digital spectrum sent faxes and emailed them this has been going on for nearly a month a real waste of money my time	1
0	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips are they abandoning this product \? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself	1
1	i really enjoy this small high quality camara i purchased a 2 0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage of the 7 1 mega pixel and i get great pix everytime i have lots of fun with it since its so small it 's easy to take everywhere with me i also get lots of compliments on it 's fashionable sleek design i highly recomend his camera	1
0	the battery does not hold up after 10 months it would not work at all i thought it was the battery emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable i found one and changed it out myself the unit was just dead warranty is 60 days will not buy another one	1
1	the cover over the lense broke small lcd screen pictures are pritty good battery life is pritty good some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady takes nice portaits easy to use has a veiw finder	1
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size it was n't even close no size was given for the lense diameter i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it	1
0	i paid 99 00 for this little camcorder thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc the menu button would not bring anything up so overall we just could n't get this thing to work a bummer of a christmas present	1
0	i loved this camera but i have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous system error 2 design fault which plagues many of these the repair service is slow the camera has been in repair 50 of the year i have had it	1
1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery plus if an electrical outlet is convienent like when shooting inside you never have to worry about running out of power also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc ac converter but not as overall convienent as an extra battery i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery but it does n't nikon should add this feature in	1
1	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it the quality of the pictures is very poor showing large grain even at shq and low iso settings no combination of settings seems to improve quality	1
1	this tripod arrived on time and in good condition however i have to put the heavy duty in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well the weight you can put on it is limited however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer	1
1	i am pleased with the purchase very good value picture quality is good and it is easy to operate only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic however it looks good this is my second purchase of this product one for myself and one as a gift	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	the leather is very soft and the case is simply quality i should have bought this one the first time	1
0	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
0	we have had this camera for about a year we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone	1
1	very happy with the lens and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
1	i 've seen this item for no less than 7 00 elsewhere so i got a good deal	1
1	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
0	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera the battery is dead i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day i should expect very much i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes but i should n't have to do so	1
1	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field it does not appear on the lcd you can only see it through the viewfinder this is different from previous models minor annoyance the quality of the videos was surprisingly good but it saves them in the quicktime mov format mov is not my favorite format but perhaps others will not be bothered by this although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural i have found it to be excellent the overall quality of the pictures is good for the price i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers	1
0	i am not satisfied by this product the calrity is not good also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen	1
1	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these and the charger is okay just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most	1
1	is an product of great quality is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1
1	this is one fantastic flash i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
0	thought i 'd died and gone to heaven this lens was everything i wanted and more three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus now it does a focus dance clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus it 's not my d70 which still works wth other lenses this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it i 'll revise this review	1
0	the s9000 fits perfectly in the case too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop apparently the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also too bad the camera strap is extremely short made for very small people so instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well i will adapt the case to work for me i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on it will work but only after extensive modification great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	1
1	i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field this tripod works well for that use it is sturdy has lots of features and is reasonably priced however if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars a right angle adapter will be needed i found one on ebay for a few dollars	1
0	i have an r717 camera i bought the dock too each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera i bought a clone battery \( not hp \) and its edges are rounded too maybe hp could explain the difference just thought you would like to know	1
0	date on still photo will not print it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	1
1	i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz 7 the lz 7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode pros takes great pictures optical image stabilization 6x zoom and great price it is also made in japan not china as the nikon l5 is cons fixed zoom while in movie mode no on board camera speakers	1
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos we promptly sent it back for a refund i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !	1
0	here 's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired the camera is only about 2 years old guess i 'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits ! the camera really performed nicely when it was working thus the 2 stars hope you have better luck than me if you get one	1
1	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily	1
1	300 plus minutes of recording time \( without lcd \) i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery on the hdr fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time	1
1	this is a great lens for any user professional or amateur this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive clean results a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm \( 16mm cropped \) but this is easily correctable with software in addition the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door architecture shots \( especially realtors \)	1
1	wow ! ! ! this is my 4th sony i keep trading up and i am so impressed there is no delay on the shutter speed great pictures and enough special effects to be fun but not enough that you need a phd to operate	1
0	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
1	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	1
0	crap does n't work wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period plastic junk never did get a good signal the worst sony item i 've ever purchased and i'm a sony fan will still attempt to return somehow do n't even bother	1
1	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
0	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures	1
1	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little \( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards \) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation make sure to get a memory stick with it though because w o it it only holds about 15 pics this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again	1
1	after 2 years the camera 's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge this replacement battery arrived promptly fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours i wish i had replaced the battery sooner instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power	1
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
1	i love this flash i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual i would definitely recommend this flash	1
0	unless you want to have trouble focusing have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event or have the neck strap bracket break off etc i wear glasses and these never did focus well for me i was not happy when the bracket broke off the day i received them just as i was to leave for an africa safari vacation the biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip and it was frustrating even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired suposedly there is a warranty on these hah ! when i sent them to bushnell for repair they wanted	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	this product is exactly as it is described wonderful tasting and delicious too bad it does n't come in a bigger container	2

1	sure it 's not 100 pure vanilla extract that 's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin personally i love its strong distinctive flavor regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is for those who feel it 's too strong use half the amount listed in the recipe i know a couple of people who do this when using molina vanilla again i like the flavor so i use the full amount called for in the recipe this stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch	2

1	i have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago i was horrified this past thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it i tried to improvise with garlic powder and italian seasoning but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past i ca n't say enough great things about this stuff i use it to season burgers steak to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes it 's not just great it 's amazing ! !	2
1	i did n't realize when i bought them they were so big i just thought they were little bottles they still have the same great taste	2
1	yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free there are technical issues with the pods 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work \( i have black decker home cafe machine \) great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it i also feel that to charage 15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi	2

1	great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike more of an end of the night activity unless you 're just having a dessert party of course ! my one complaint is the impractical \( although oh so whimsical \) tissue packaging it is hazardously absorbent even the assertive flavors of these high quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items note do not store next to your curry sampler best of luck chocoholics a z	2
1	if you appreciate caliente you must try this	2
1	this tea is awesome i had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet after finding it on amazon i looked up all the benefits of green tea and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting so i ordered the jasmine green tea and with a little sugar and lemon i drink it every day excellent product ca n't live without it	2

1	i use almonds in cereal cake and bread both for nutrition and taste for years i 've been grinding my own this is a high quality product that saves time since it 's already ground the price is highly competitive	2
1	much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets ! i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs not worth the cost ! this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies ideally i 'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past ! it also comes in a very nice basket which is great to re use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage	2

0	i was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements i had nothing but high hopes i was totally open minded i thought it seemed too good to be true \( low cal no carb noodles ! \) but hey i'm an optimist guess what \? it is too good to be true ! i read about washing them and drying them i did no problem i added sauce i put them in my mouth the taste was not the problem it was the texture it was seriously like chewing rubber bands no noodle resemblence whatsoever i honestly ca n't understand those who rave about these but hey to each his own	2
0	the photo shows four containers each 9oz the product is actually only one 9oz container very misleading possibly intentionally so also shipping costs 10 for a 9 product \? give me a break ! on top of it all the chocolate is nothing special you can get 16oz containers of ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for 10 which tastes better	2

1	first of all wow instant noodles for sale on amazon \? second excellent decision on selling nongshim 's shin ramen nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen 's trademark spicyness and deliciosity not as filling as the non cup version \( which you have to cook over a stove \) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied for three hours until you get hungry for more shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion	2

1	i received my package via ups in a reasonable amount of time the coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful but not fake tasting however i did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use for some reason a couple of cups came out really weak so i referred to the senseo handbook for a hint now when i put a pod in i make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly that seems to have solved the problem	2
1	i was really impressed that i was able to buy this product on line it was easy to make the purchase and received the goods on time i will definitely order from them again	2

1	i am new to the world of gourmet salts and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago ! the granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel but that is where the similiarities end the salt dissolves instantly on the tongue it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste the jar suggests it be used on grilled fish and salads but i would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also	2
1	my husband and i were introduced to market spice tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in seattle we loved it and upon our return to jamesville ny begain to regularly order it many of our friends now order it too it is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea	2

1	this is a delicious basic thai yellow curry with some vegetables it comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal but i still found that with this meal i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes nuts or eggplant i do n't have any thai places in my area so i add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that thai craving the sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	2

1	i use these onions for just about everything they are pretty mild and really add a nice light flavor to your cooking this is about what i pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order but then again it is online shopping for groceries so i guess it has to be pricey i use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath ! great great stuff and i highly recommend them	2
1	a friend shared her marketspice tea with me years ago and i was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me i ordered some and that wonderful taste was still the same the teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in it 's a flavor you wo n't find anywhere else you can taste the orange and the cinnamon and they 're just a little sweet you may not need to even sweeten yours !	2

1	oh how i love the most delicious incredible edible fruit of the plant cucumis sativus who would 've thought that this was a member of the gourd family cucurbitaceae a cousin of the melon \? cucumbers have many great uses they 're delicious in salads and is there any snack tastier than a pickle \? i also hear they have non culinary uses as well some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes maybe that 's because they 're 90 water i 've also heard that there are more adult uses for the cucumber but i 've only seen that in movies	2

1	these crackers are absolutely delicious whether you need to be eating gluten free or not i ca n't getenough of them my favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored these crackers are thin andcrunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a servingonto the cracker i love them alone i love them with tuna fish i 've used them for dipping salsa andguacamole but when i see them all disappearing quickly i hope i have n't used up my last box beingi am gluten intolerant this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when i'm craving something crunchyand flavorful	2
1	i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts	2
1	i first tried these in south africa now my best friend will ship some to me with packages that she sends on my birthday or other special occasions i love them ! i want to have them here in the states ! ! !	2

1	this was not exactly what i was expecting i thought it would be more like what i call vietnamese sesame balls yet they were pretty good despite my mistake	2
1	i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	2
1	i really enjoy this tea has the best flavor of any of the oolongs i have tried the leaves are whole and you do not get a lot of tea particles in your cup or pot	2
1	we originally purchased this candy in walt disney world at the japan pavilion when we returned home the kids wanted more of it but i could n't find any around town i came to amazon and here it was they were thrilled it has a good flavor and texture and they really enjoyed it	2
1	i recently started a diet where i could only eat the egg white not the yolk because of the fat content i make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source the powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen \( anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what i'm talking about \) not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore i also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs this is a fantastic product and well worth the cost	2
0	i would like to buy one of these products from wine country gift baskets but i cannot find a description of what is actually in each one	2
0	come on this is 2005 twinkies are n't food anymore than cheez whiz is twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while i'm just as guilty of that but eating twinkies is practically self mutilation look at the ingredients list and do some reading yikes ! everyone 's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too sorry hostess that definitely does not include twinkies	2
1	this is very good peanut brittle i found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free in fact i found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle i have eaten most peanut brittle is hard as a rock this brand had a perfect crisp crunch	2
1	the sugar free was very good i 've had the regular but these are really good too especially if you are a diabetic or just want to avoid sugar quite a few flavors	2

1	have n't tried cooking with them yet but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way they are beautiful specimens i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them	2
1	these egg whites work great and are economical i recently started a diet where i can only eat egg whites it seems such a waste to throw out the yolks not to mention the mess of separating the eggs i use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods the powdered egg whites do have an eggy odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets	2
1	better than expected quality very nice quality and very attractive quick shipping and response	2
1	i bought this candy and when i tasted it it tasted so good so its the best candy but it hurts your teeth when you eat but this is good and addicting cand	2

1	i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted if you 'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat	2
1	do n't go for generic gooey dollar store imitations this is what gummy bears are supposed to be the next best are black forest	2
1	now i'm all in favor of hershey 's kisses but you look at this guy here and you kind of have to wonder i mean who buys 25 lbs of individually packaged chocolate count chocula on a bender \? perennial halloween door answerers preparing for the apocalypse \? let 's face it this is the ultimate milk chocolate and tinfoil experience i just hope you 're ready for it	2
1	this was a delight to receive ! it was delivered fast and was packaged beautifully ! there is a little something for everyone and everything is fresh and delicious i plan on ordering for friends and office for the holidays	2
0	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2
1	these are really good just like in the uk you 'd think they were caviar from the pricing though	2

1	tuscan milk kosher ! vitamin d and grade a ! good source calcium ! thank you	2
1	when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better it is more slender with richer chocolate it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much very balanced if you love chocolate this is definitly better worth trying	2
1	ume en is one of the best brands of green tea powder i have ever tasted this tea has a light delicate flavor with just a touch of sweetness which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful relaxing and rejuvenating experience with this drink tea time is going to take on a whole new meaning i would definitely recommend this product	2

1	never had biscotti before what a treat since then i 've tried other biscotti and this was the best	2
1	nothing says 'taste of italy' like a gallon of tuscan 's finest the aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course even veal ! it 's even great paired with dessert ! do n't be fooled by cheap imitations folks this is the real thing ! remember if it 's tuscan it 's kosher ! now with extra whiteness	2
1	i found this candy in the 7 eleven in my area two years ago and just loved it i would eat so much my mouth would blister inside but since last year have searched high and low but cant find it anywhere can i order it myself and not go to a store my kids love it as well and have tried other sour candys but none come clos	2
1	obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot ! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope ! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass	2
1	i'm definitely a satisfied customer my dhl package got to me damaged and the box was wet the bubble tea customer service representatives where wonderful about replacing it i will buy from them again ! they have excellent customer service in my book ! thanks ange	2
1	my japanese pen pal y yamamoto just adores strawberry pocky and tells me they 're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations mind you i'm not sure i should believe yohko chan as she describes these situations many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way but i must admit they 're entertaining reading and the souvenier she sent me from that space hot springs was rather interesting although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me still i want to date her friend ruuan she looks hot in an amazingly ditzy sort of way	2
0	this tea is very bitter it is very aromatic it does smell nice and exotic but it was just too much for my simple tastebuds	2
1	this candy is awesome read my review i posted on the 5lb bag page and while you are at it buy the 5 bag they are way cheaper this 12 pack ends up being only 3 75 lbs and costs 12 50 and the 5lb bag is only 13 00 as of this review	2
1	this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only 12 for 12 ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it	2
1	the kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool they appear to be quite fresh have cooked with them it was wonderful thank	2
1	pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills	2
1	of all teas i 've tried this is my favorite sweet powerful and fragrant marketspice is the answer for many moods and cravings i prefer this tea hot steeped for 5 minutes but its good cold as well although i 've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming be warned if you only like very subtle white teas this may not be for you but it has converted many a non tea drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	2
1	marmite is great its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you 'd been walking around in an old factory for a day i think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world thank god they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth	2
1	if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend	2
1	the best of the best for harley enthusiasts well written fair and honest great motorcycle accessory and clothing reviews terrific custom bike features and excellent presentation easy to follow tech and classics without all the girlie nonsense	3
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
1	i have read vanity fair for the past twenty years the articles are timely and in depth there are articles on politicians bankers ceos as well as the hollywood types this is the magazine for those who want to be in the know also the photographs are fantastic if you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress actor of the hour this is not the magazine for you	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	i'm very disappointed with this magazine it seems to be a total waste of money i found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2 3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas but it 's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something i can use	3
0	it is impossible to review this item as item was never received i have found it very difficult to contact anyone to find out where this item is	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market very realistic with budgets too it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable \( on any budget \) i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful	3
0	i ordered in november and i am still waiting to receive this item	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine they had no problem charging my credit card but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year what a bunch of nonesense	3
1	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name however i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light but there is so much more always an article on a travel destination an article on beauty and an article on a sport as well as other constants the theme of the magazine is total healthy living incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive	3
0	i have read bird times many times the articles are much less complicated than the bird talk magazine articles which are fairly simplistic as well i recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read this magazine usually takes me 15 20 minutes to read and that is if there is an interesting article fewer ads than bird talk	3
1	for those of us who miss being in the center of the universe reading the observer is almost like being there in its pink pages i can read stories about new york 's political arts society finance sex and gossip scene i can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in vermont	3
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing boy am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health	3
1	i like the different projects and items you can buy plus they give prices and online addresses overall i'm quite pleased with this magazine	3
1	budget travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland i also like some not all of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written however at the same time it does need better organization as compared with \( horrors \) conde nast i am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible i cant access it ! !	3
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges \( 6 and 9 \) and is a valuable investment for any parent i do n't know what i would do without this magazine it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car not to mention it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months	3
1	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom while she shopped i hung out in the magazine section reading mad cracked and fangoria now 25 years later i finally got my own subscription and unlike retro video games nostalgic 80 's cd 's and members only jackets this is just as good as i remember it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases the low down on independent if not underground extreme horror dvd 's and as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine it is a great read and a lot of fun	3
1	this magazine transports you to a different world every issue is a wish book with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month or crafts to do over your next long weekend or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room well in my life years go by and i dream on but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped negative angry thoughts i will never laugh at crafty people again i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside but the dreams are sweet the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating but then you have gardening cooking baking furniture decorating beading anything do it yourself martha is truly a wonder woman worth every cent	3
1	i never subscribe to anything ! this magazine is great there are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes i'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines are n't that useful to me i might enjoy reading them but i do n't actually use their recipes i 've made 4 of the recipes out of this last everyday food issue and they were very healthy \( lots of veggies chicken brown rice salmon etc \) tasted really good and were also fast which is a bonus for me i 'd give this magazine 10 stars if i could	3
1	ordered this for my son sometimes it takes a while for the order to reach him in prison so i'm not sure he has received it yet since you wrote and reminded me i'm thinking it did get to him as others have been returned	3
1	spike fett is mistaken the 100 greatest moments he mentions is not for all time they were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime which is only 8 years this is one of the best film dvd magazines out there i highly reccomend it it has awesome articles reliable reviews and great color photos another thing i like about it is that its an british publication so you get a different opinion and point of view its a great magazine	3
0	i had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until i bought one from our local super market i was surprised at the difference that i had already paid to order from amazon and what it was there i canceled my order and ordered from them some items are much less on amazon and some are much more you just have to be careful a magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from	3
0	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine beware beware beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way r tully is great about responding to emails it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly if at all i recommend cooking light it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy	3
1	this magazine is by far the best food travel magazine out a bit on the expensive side due to it coming from bbc in england but worth every pound dollar	3
1	as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose	3
0	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas it 's june and she has yet to get a copy i called them in march and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer i 'll going to ask for a refund	3

1	i look forward to recieving my magazine every month i really love this magazine it has articles marriage sex women 's lives etc i do n't know why the others did n't enjoy it	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
1	the smartest best informed and most well entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture i read it cover to cove	3
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
1	this is a fun read the articles are entertaining and short good to pass some time excellent for the plane !	3

1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines	3
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall i had recently watched quot secretary quot and i liked her so i bought it i'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue after buying my first flaunt magazine i wanted to buy more but needless to say the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time \( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there	3
1	i absolutely adore elle decoration as several other reviewers have noted unfortunately the american version ca n't compare the spaces are gorgeous and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious all of my american magazines \( with the exception of interior design \) get ripped apart with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed elle decoration always gets saved in its entirety i highly recommend these magazines are eye candy and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import	3
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	3
0	amazon must think we are fools it 's 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website on the other hand there appear to be a lot of fools here	3
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
1	a good start to create your own business	3
1	great magazine this is not my typical type of read because i 've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi media but the great thing about this magazine is that you do n't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos it tells you about them in simple terms too no high tech vocabulary needed i feel informed whenever i read my monthly subscription of the better products to purchase as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies	3
0	this magazine fell apart so quick they are no longer a unbias magazine instead they are a interscope propaganda machine just look at the covers \? every year shady g unit gets a automatic 8 covers every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag	3

1	i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business	3
1	great magazine covers the full range of net technologies every issue is packed with windows web and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more high recomended	3
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue	3
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature stupid and boring the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste do n't bother	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3

1	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3

0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living i was actually appalled by this magazine it is ostensibly health conscious but upon closer examination it ignores important health information for example in one issue it had a whole article about diabetes and how thanks to the miracles of science diabetics can now eat sugary foods it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet i was disappointed with the magazine	3
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3

1	i 've been a subscriber of e magazine \( which stands for the environmental magazine \) for over a year now and i love it it is by far the best environmentally oriented magazine i 've come across all of the ads are for environmentally friendly companies and products i now purchase products at at least 50 of the places advertised in this magazine e magazine covers topics all over the world including global warming horse meat \( popular in europe \) whaling deforestation etc if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine the issues are bi monthly but are absolutely action packed and fact filled subscribe today	3
0	i cook almost everything from scratch so i figured home cooking would be for people like me who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines instead recipes consist of packaged dough in a can bottled sauces etc i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !	3
0	as is typical of many magazines sunset jams it to existing subscribers they offered me a deal to re subscribe for 12 months for 29 95 ! here on amazon i can get two years \( 24 months \) for 29 95 magazines need to understand basic marketing it takes a lot of advertising dollars \( mailings \) to get a new subscriber once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business	3
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3

1	as a reader i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month i usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word of mouth advice but that 's never been enough for me reading a book is an investment to me and i want to make sure my time is well spent bookmarks gives me the confidence that i'm choosing the books i truly want to read i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes \( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer yukio mishima which also shows that bookmarks looks globally not only regionally for classic authors \)	3
0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships i found that customer service was very dissapointing i missed an issue back in october and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed it is now march and i still have n't received my replacement just a heads up !	3

0	this magazine makes girls who feel geeky and nerdy bad and girls who are normal teens who have crushes and like to stay in style terrible ! plus this magazine is sexist ! it does n't have models anywhere because it says that it makes girls feel bad ! if you want a magazine that is good and inspires read american girls or girls life !	3

1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	3
0	where macworld is bad addict is dreadful it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat and the reviews do n't deserve the name the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing leaving no pretence of independence like its competitor it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry so we get articles about the secrets of such and such product a secret in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer this should be blasted not applauded but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product	3
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day and he really likes it recommend it	3

0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews unlike the description included on the amazon website the subsription does not include the cd rom which costs an additional 1 issue and if you want to purchase the cd roms for past issues they cost 4 disk sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain buyer beware	3

0	this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo do n't waste your money	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
1	this is the magazine for windows it pros i have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at windows nt magazine over time it has gotten thinner but the articles are as informative as ever	3
1	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club \( where he works out \) if you overlook that aspect the mag is great the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate well worth it it also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store	3

0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke it is not that special it is chucked full of ads the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information i find this magazine a waste of our money it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription my mom has already stated that	3

0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago today it is a totally unneeded magazine its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article is actually quite goofy the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm	3
0	love to review history today but have n't seen a copy yet any ideas	3
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription i only received about 3 issues total months went by without anything being delivered while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful nothing happens immediately when planning a wedding each and every month is precious especially during the initial stages of wedding planning to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting plus by this time most of the wedding details were finalized the magazines i received became useless if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride	3
0	i admit they have some good recipes but most of them are not simple and very time consuming there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe if you are a stay at home housewife and absolutely love to cook buy this but if you are just normal you wo n't find many recipes in here for you i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home' before you buy this one	3
1	had great expectations for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there \( and available on the web \) the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine elektor electronics and hardware hack websites would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription am still hoping	3
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
1	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug these are just the best children 's publications we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends	3
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3

0	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	there is never a dull moment with this magazine ! you never know what the next story is going to be just that it will be a great read ! really good photography and illustrations too ! so if you are interested in what makes this world tick check out smithsonian magazine	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that do n't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it very important when it comes to encouraging creativity	3
1	if you live in the country and have a hobby type farm this magazine is bulging with valuable information i was surprised to find no color pages at first but the magazine is recycleable paper printed with soy ink very cool out of all the country type magazines i 've read this one is the best	3
1	i only got the first issue but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers \( hence the name \) i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction they might do well to keep the two separate especially the contests and events it 's an attractive format and very upscale high quality literature reviews and advice the stories are well written and enjoyable although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers	3

0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3

1	bell'italia is an italian language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described the photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving moreover in the more famous cities like venice and florence the places presented are often those that do not get much notice in addition the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting i have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue	3

0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3

1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit it is only as good as the tools you use this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material	3
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full page ads for galleries in europe there are very few articles or artist bios the photos are beautiful but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries	3
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue however as other reviews have indicated the articles are quite lacking they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting so you get vogue for the pictures if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine if you want something to read get something else	3

0	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3

1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3

0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	3
1	i have subscribed for years to this in my opinion the hand 's down best most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available practical solidly researched non preachy and impeccably edited it provides even handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog 's happiness well being and ability to be a good companion the annual dog food ratings alone are worth the subscription price every constituency should be as well served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one	3
1	rue morgue is a true horror magazine you get countless articles on upcoming recent and past horror with interviews from writers directors stars and more there 's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors crave more horror on the 'net then rue morgue is always giving you your fill on websites and what i 've always found to be an awesome thing about rue morgue there 's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini posters and they 're glossy paged rue morgue you just slashed into my heart and did it right	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles profanity porn and blurry black and white photos it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost	3
1	someone posted below that they do n't receive all their issues i have never failed to receive an issue i suspect someone is making off with this person 's copies this is an elegant magazine worthy of martha if they cover a topic you will know all there is to know about that topic the recipes are little gems and i like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved it 's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world i do miss martha 's column of reminiscences and wish that was back in the magazine	3
1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive the articles are interesting and well written the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders if you 're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must have magazine	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
1	i love this magazine and am on my third year the recipes are interesting healthy and easy to make after a day at work they do n't use fake ingredients which was my complaint with cooking light i 'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance and the recipes do n't take all day and 24 7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in gourmet the nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps real food for real life	3
1	came right away and in a timely fashion every two weeks ! great product for a wonderful price ! loved it	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3

1	i go to a gym where people share their magazines and came across this gem while it focuses on value vacation packages the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world the magazine also offers an up to date web page describing even more places and bargains it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots that alone is worth the reasonable cost	3
1	i am not the only to think jose da silveira is not straight now that his carrer is back on track the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging i believe this is the reason this yvette linton smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay just your little detective susi	3

1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nasttraveler and i'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire this magazine has articles about places not about \( as one other reviewer wrote \) articles about martinis fashion etc it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one	3

1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified thanks so much	3
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords she stopped receiving it in june well before her 12 month subscription expired	3
1	this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that pictureimportant they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed \( if it is a person \) this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy	3
1	time is a fascinating magazine to read it provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time the magazine provides more balanced reporting than say newsweek i find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics the arts business and lifestyle and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening so for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide then time magazine should do to those already subscribing for the magazine congratulations for making a good choice	3
1	maxim is a good magazines for adult males i enjoy all articles and their website too it is more affordable subscrition	3
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
1	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4
1	although i did not purchase this product from amazon com \( \) i absolutely love it the gps locator provided is amazing and better than i thought it was it is not one of those gps that updates your position every 20 seconds or something but when i zoomed in i could see my current location constantly moving on the map \( so it is updating every second \) i have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the gps provided to them is n't even this good i recommend this software and gps to anyone	4
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
0	i guess i'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children this game has an enormous amount of story it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television interaction is confusing and frustrating i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation which is top notch i just would n't classify this as a learning game	4
1	i think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning however it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program in order to get the most out of the program i feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level lesson	4
1	do n't expect to receive this by christmas even though it says in stock i ordered this on dec 14th and just received word today the 20th that it is not expected to ship until the end of january early february so if you need it for a specific occasion do n't count on it getting there in time	4
0	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too the colors were spot on after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse my monitor appears dim the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time my hope was that it would make my monitor look better not worse i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	4
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour this includes capital gains losses dividends and amt calculations it does n't get much easier than this yes you have to download updates the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it but would n't that take at least as long	4
0	i agree with reviewer mr dietz i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for 24 99 put it in and loaded it in this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all no help menu either we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her there is nothing here to learn chess from	4

1	this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike it no longer supports windows 98 which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years the street maps it produces are accurate except for a few minor glitches	4
1	you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very messy system but it does have a great antivirus and firewall and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes it 's an okay product but be very careful with the cleanup tool it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	4
1	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	4
1	works work what cam i say i have been using microsoft products for years quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant	4
0	i found this software very difficult to use it does not have any stop or go back button the only way to exit an activity is to hit esc button to exit the program and then start all over when starting over there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and i could not find a way to skip it	4
0	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return and it calculated that i owed the state 550 for underpayment as well as a 230 penalty for late payment i tried working through the program several times to find the error i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem which i was not able to resolve in frustration i went to and filed my return easily within an hour with a 140 return from the state rather than a 780 penalty	4
0	i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it boy are they right this thing is terrible after installing on windows xp sp2 as soon as i started the program it crashed now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner it crashes every time product is useless wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !	4
0	the product is so so there are others that do the same thing for a bit less but colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support you are screwed between putting you on hold for ever not calling back etc	4
0	do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy but this software is not easy to use you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand	4
0	this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip forcing the ribbon on the user assumes that the user likes icons \( i do n't what 's wrong with words \? \? \) and fills too much of the screen real estate nothing is where it should be and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views no classic view just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons another oppressive giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft	4
1	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
0	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4

1	i recently purchased this from a book club and it is a wonderful bible type is easy to read and the imitation leather binding cover is of high quality the various colors help guide you to passages of the same intent very innovative great	4
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4
1	product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition	4
0	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	4
0	do n't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates it corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you you will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software instead just follow these steps to keep your pc fast 1 run disk cleanup \( provided by xp \) 2 defrag your hard disk regularly3 clean the registry \( there are lot of free software available to clean your registry \) that 's all that you need to keep your computer fit no need to use softwares such as fix i	4

1	the product of windows xp professional is just what i was looking for with many updated features and i am looking forward in using it daily it was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it but most of all service was top knotch i could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems i may have had customer service is a plus i would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	4
1	good product however i do n't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time i open the program perhaps they should try to get it right the first time and it 's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me using it with quicken is a pita it is unclear to me how you get more than one state	4
1	i 've only been using this program for about a month its not a simple program for me for i'm not business savvy with help of a cpa and the wonderful tutorials and help program i'm getting the program and its working so well ! i love it	4

0	obviously bogus reviews version 6 was slow as a dog so any improvement will make this more interesting of course rasing the price to 300 and 450 is less interesting what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 \? how bout tossing us all a bone	4
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

1	the last reviewer did n't see any point to this software partially that 's true you do n't need it to create your photostamp you can do the same thing online however there is one big plus to the software product buying a single sheet of photostamps direct from their website costs 24 99 2 99 shipping at this writing in contrast amazon is selling this boxed version which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps for seven bucks less than that do the math	4
1	drills are excellent vocabulary has good variety picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language	4
1	i bought this program for my daughter for her birthday she wanted it because she 's used it at school \( 1st grade \) i was impressed by how easy it was to install i installed it as admin and she had no issues running it under her limited account \( xp pro \) i 've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program she even made valentine 's day cards for her whole class with it just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink	4
0	systemworks continues to grow taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer and i'm likely to buy an alternative next time i update note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer a new hard drive motherboard or processor and symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy i like the basic functions but there 's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	4

1	i'm planning a motorcylce trip in italy this summer and the program gives me all the info i need on routes and sites of intertest along the way overall a great product	4
0	this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix it turns them a light shade of grey maybe it is horrible this to me renders it useless it is for the most basic of users there are no real manual functions to speak of and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly i would say do not buy seller was great product is poor	4

0	i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti virus programs i purchased the 3 pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer when i contacted norton they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers i will never purchase another norton product	4
1	i purchased elements because frankly i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada i have found it to be pretty intuitive lots and lots of options as to organization photo tweaking and such i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos i do have two other imaging programs and with the addition of elements i feel like i'm basically well set with zillions of options plus there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples such as textures and so on very helpful get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program you will not be disappointed	4
1	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
1	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements	4

1	impressed with the way it clears out viruses spyware and trojans i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it that all goes well what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign me in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	4

0	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4

0	we were big fans of taxcut especially after turbo added spyware this year's tax cut has irreguarities that are costing \( \) me for example you file your college student 's return and check the box that she he will be an exemption on the head of household return then comes the surprise head of household ca n't file their return with that college student as an exemption despite checking the proper boxes ! for example it ca n't caluculate railroad retirement benefits for example it tells you that your return is a okay you pay 15 then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another 15 to refile ! good bye tax cut !	4

0	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4

0	i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage 2002 for years it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do n't think my latest sites would be up yet sorry i do n't mean to be mean it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically i'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade i do n't know	4

1	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4

0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
0	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4 0 is a downgrade from 3 0 performance is very poor especially the organizer it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera compared to elements recently i 've been getting lots of crashes though everything else on my system is completely stable the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality when it works correctly	4
1	i have used tax cut for several years have had no complaints it is easy to use and is very complete plan to use it again next year	4
1	i purchased this program simply for the encarta 2007 i was amazed at all of the wonderful features that microsoft put into the package i feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life enjoy it	4
1	ca n't say enough for it there is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all i 've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up they have been consistrantly excelant	4

0	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about 6 months of 'trying' to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	4
0	this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless	4
1	i have viewed pdf files for years never made one before the installation was simple and converting word excel or other files to pdf is one click away only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied	4
1	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	4
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles they are multi column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors in fact because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working way to go nuance	4
0	their approach might work for other languages but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language which rosetta stone never explains it simply displays four pictures at you with some incomprehensible \( to a beginner \) chinese near them and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures i 've taken chinese for two years and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it i either knew the words already or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online	4

0	talk about junk ! no search capability mislabeled cds some cds wo n't run in short yuk !	4
0	the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users it seems to have bugs too starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet but i'm close	4

1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
1	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4

0	i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version 14 and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version 14 and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base	4

1	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4
0	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4
1	i have used the hallmark card studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version i like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two	4
1	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4

1	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program my ear is now tuned to the language i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses my vocabulary still needs to get stronger but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french that is only a matter of practice with the language as advertised this program is painless and progress is rapid try the demo you 'll see	4

0	i have been a faithful mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids this game is a big disappointment the language game is virtually unplayable in french i am fluent in french and went to a french language university for nine years i could barely understand what the characters were saying if this program is intended to teach kids a second language it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead this game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of french	4

1	not a complicated application but it successfully repartitioned a 100g drive into 3rds on a new lenovo laptop with xp sp2 i would recommend using the dos version which you can get just by booting on the cd requires no install you can simply boot make the changes and it is done seems to be very straightforward and i would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with windows running	4

0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4

1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	4

1	look notation software is notoriously expensive all musicians know that so when you see songwriter and its price it 's a relief everything you need is in this program i only have one complaint when adding an expressive dynamic \( p mp mf f ff etc \) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes it leaves an ugly looking score other than that this is the best deal on the market for what it is	4
1	i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one the video tutorials are the greatest help of all the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want but that is not the easiest task i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true	4

0	this program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts it is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic the word bubble sdo not rotate so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to it looks really great on the cover of the cd and that 's what sold me it was a disapointing christmas	4
0	i tried unsuccessfully several times to install it i contact their alleged support they sent me what they deemed a fix the fix was awful it caused my computer to crash and print shop would never work broderbund used to be a good company but i 've had nothing but problems with their software of late they need to rethink their products their support and their company focus they are lousy at this point they obviously do n't give a dang about quality support or their customers	4

0	1 you ca n't print on anything over 8 5x14 paper useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale 2 i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3 0 of broderbund 3d home architect it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	4
1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
0	cakewalk s advertisement saying something like no experience needed to operate this software is in my mind mis leading at least and a down right lie at most i 've had it now for about three weeks work on it most days usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it and still cant get anything out of it all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work blues pop country so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen beware unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed	4

0	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual	4
1	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4
1	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
0	if you read the license you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print certainly ca n't sell them and ca n't let others copy them unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission you probably do n't want this software	4

1	if you 're looking for a professional office suite ms office 2007 has no real competitors i 've worked extensively with corel office and some with open office they 're fine for the basics and they cost less but if you 're looking for effectiveness integration speedy productivity and an incredible array of tools you 'll want to buy ms office 2007 and as an added bonus the interface makes it a pleasure to work in	4
0	although crayola is a wonderful brand i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them and they get frustrated it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture also it is not mess free the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch \( other than paper \) anyways i did not like how mushy the paint was i am still finding globs of it everywhere	5
1	vakama is very cool you must get him ! he wears the great mask of concelment and comes with a kanoka disk	5
1	my son loves this game when moving around the tracks in the one game it can be difficult the key is if you moving up or down depending on which direction you need to go push the joystick the direction once and let go after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go i hope this helps my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks mom dad and sis had to play before that the other games are a little easier but i found the games educational and my son loves it	5

0	this game was not at all what i expected the steering wheel and pedals are just for looks you actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel and many of the games had nothing to do with driving so glad i opened it to try it before christmas morning this is one toy that is headed back to the store	5
0	bought these beads for my 18 month old he enjoys taking them in and out of the container they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved	5

0	dont waste your money on this one the picture is cute but the quailty of the toy isnt any good the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child the concept is supposed to be like the game memory your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting your better off just buying the real memory game the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price	5

1	this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it it plays pre programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols \( like my daughter ! \) and it really is pretty we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played it also does a pretty light show i cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3 6 year old girls	5
0	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to	5

0	the truck gets clogged up often it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load the tower is decent albeit it does n't quite work as advertised as well our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way i grew up in the domino rally days and compared to the original toys these do n't stack up the truck and tower just are n't worth it you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails	5
1	i love it ! it 's really light weight and portble the batteries do go dead without the charger and the pvds should have more then 30 minutes 60minutes i like this video now alot calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it 's wonderful i hope you buy it !	5

0	bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily the level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it my only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages \( for the spiral binding \) the pages tend to be separated there so i think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength	5

1	this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc that is why i think it is educational to that respect my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along	5

1	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys my 2 and 3 year old sons enjoy playing with them no complaints here	5
1	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen it has a contrast adjustment but it not very helpful it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast	5

1	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product here i am fulfilling my promise they were able to pedal the bike within 2 3 days of getting them they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car \( 89 chevy camaro \) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns	5
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge the only downside are some of the very small pieces definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3	5
1	this is a single player game set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated by the end the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before both kids love it ages 4 and 9 we helped the four year old learn the tricks by just asking whoes in that cars way \? then whoes in the trucks way \? until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards	5

1	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7 he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships he would say where his ships were this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game	5

0	oh my gosh this is terrible ! my husband and i bought this game because i loved watching this as a child this game uses the same prizes and games over and over if you played once you have played too many times the games are boring the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time i do n't know why the box says 13 and up because my 10 year old daughter could play this this one is going back to the store i got zonked out of my 24 99 if you want my opinion take the cash and run	5
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games it is basically boring and ill conceived i have played it a few times with my kids and found it to be of no particular interest on any level it is neither fun exciting or challenging for them or me i strongly recommend you try a cranium game or how about chess \? \? \? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game is that it 's better than tv which is n't saying much	5
1	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5
1	this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer i enjoy watching him do the math \( one with the coins \) as well as watching him make words	5
0	my daughter got this for her 5th birthday and it really looks cute and fun in the box within 5 minutes of playing with it the small clip that holds the starfish open broke in addition the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic if your kids are like mine they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it this toy is really cute but not worth it save yourself the hassle buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in	5
0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	5
1	these weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets	5
0	all thomas the train products are overpriced there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price choose one of those ! save yourself some money	5
1	my 3 year old son loves this puzzle and has played with it for over a year he likes to put it together over and over again making a train across the floor it has really helped him to learn his alphabet and i highly recommend it !	5
1	we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it ! he does n't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them overall this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder we ca n't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun ! ! lego always makes great and challenging toys !	5
0	this toy is not what i had expected it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it	5
1	my 3 year old is very interested in space and loves this toy having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it the payload doors do n't really close the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on meets the need for a realistic shuttle though	5
1	i have a videonow player and i luv it ! ! ! there are over 100 discs !	5
0	my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise \( which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not \) and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either	5
0	i have bought quite a few barbies from amazon recently including the caligirl series fashion fever series and barbie loves micky mouse this barbie is quite different to all above she does not have a rubber skin like others so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts her foot is quite flat only the slippers in this package fit her all other barbies' shoes do not i guess this pooh might be made with the former generation technology	5
1	my son cannot wait to get a bigger set compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is by far better quality although it is also more expensive	5
1	my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well they love to pretend to be rock stars ! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control so you only get one level loud i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing	5
0	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
1	an unexciting piece of value only to the completist collector \( like myself \) there 's nothing wrong with it it 's just that there 's nothing great about it either the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a holographic figure hasbro could has done better by choosing another host sculpt to base this exclusive off of the phantom menace version was much better	5
1	apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered \( on time incidentially ! \)	5
0	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base \( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet \) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time	5
0	i recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years i was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup i was disappointed in the dice tray it is very flimsy and not properly designed it should have a rotator and be made of more durable material also the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals i felt ripped off when i discovered this obvious mistake	5
1	if ya trade toon worldu can use toons as regular monsters and the it wont make yacange the other guy plays toon world it jes works for if u play itand it plays on on the opone	5

1	i was very happy with the product i purchased and i received it in a timely fashion the product was not worn nor used it was as if i bought it at the store at a lower cost it was a win win for me thank you	5
0	this is probably one of the best booster packs out there every monster that comes in the pack has an effect effect monsters can be very useful not to mention that my very first pharaonic guardian pack came with a secret rare ! that is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack ! even the common cards are great such as giant axe mummy or the gravekeeper cards ! your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack ! i highly suggest this pack	5

1	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon it looks really cool and can change also the little ball launcher \( i forget what it 's called \) is a lot of fun \( i shot my brother with it x3 \) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it does n't really get in the way	5
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	5
0	bought this little cooler for the back of our atw wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well but this a totally soft sided cooler with no frame or supports so if there is anything in it the cooler does not hold it 's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon looks terrible and i would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin	5
1	i received this promptly and in time for vacation was great for the kids in the car they loved the stencils that came with the board many hours of fun they like that they can make skid marks with the lightning mcqueen car	5

1	my daughter \( age 13 \) really enjoyed this game it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that	5
0	my daughter loves this toy she has the treehouse and the school house she plays with them often my only complaint is that they fall apart she does not mind i just snap it back together and she keeps playing	5
0	this tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children my son who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn it would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard forget it this is an on pavement toy only	5
1	this toy is so cool ! i use it all the time with my friend erica you could text message each other and it even takes pictures my parents bought it for me at christmas they were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes ! this toy is so cool ! now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone ! ! ! i highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy !	5
0	this item is really small i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item in hindsight i would n't have order it had i paid more attention i think the other products from haba \( eggs and teabags \) are worth the money for the size	5
0	our daughters are four and five years old the skates will not fit over our five year old 's shoe the ad clearly says three to seven years old	5
0	my cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces however she can not even use the gift you need to buy the totally beadifully jewelry maker to use this kit no where in the online description of this toy on amazon does it tell you this toy is being returned b c we do n't have the bead maker	5

0	this pirate chest is a total rip off the chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal when i ordered it as a gift for someone they sent me someone else 's order then refused to let me return my item for a refund when i finally received it the company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all	5

0	my son was excited to get this for christmas after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed the arrows launcher never held the arrows as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet	5
1	my 5 year old daughter got this monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night since my 1 year old daughter loved her big sister 's monkey so we had to get her one of her own she loves it and sleeps with her monkey every night now	5
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas his eyes lit up when he saw it he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away we did n't of course we waited a whole day thank goodness it literally took an hour to put together there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different it was very frustrating then it would n't stay together once it was finished it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since he gets so upset when he tries to play with it we saved the box it 's going back if they will take it	5
1	this is a great simple fast game that is fun for all ages	5
1	my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain he was n't able to assemble it alone eventhough he 's typically very good at assembling most other toys it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together	5
1	the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child she had a great time using her magic wands to see what would happen with the bathroom playset having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool \( i assume so dora could step up to the sink brush her teeth \) pops out was a very fun surprise my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle the whole set was a great buy	5
1	it is a little smaller than i expected but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand other than that it 's perfect my son 's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box so far it 's worked out great ! i do n't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small do n't bother me the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank	5
1	we had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one my girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make the music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them \( ages 20 months and 3 1 2 \)	5
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	5
0	i purchased two of these hand held deal or no deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys the boys found that they had trouble indicating that they 'd like to take the deal when the pressed the button to say yes to the deal the game continued as if they said no deal they got annoyed but kept on playing i tried the game thinking that they did something wrong but i also had the same problem i'm annoyed because the game was 20 each and i think it does n't work properly !	5
0	ok as far as novelty goes these ducks are soooo funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky ! ! ! i bought them for my 1 year old just because i am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky anyone who feels this lil duck toy is devil worship to has some serious issues and i would suggest they need to seek some professional help so for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because i think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight	5
0	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago but without the adult 's handle my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself and we generally like the style but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model	5
0	what a super cheap rip off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid '70 's seems like every doctor 's office break room friend 's basement etc had one of these cubes to kill time with main reason that i personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two the colored stickers start to peel off the rubik 's cube had it 's day in this high tech age i cannot see many kids having any interest in this item they might actually have to 'use' their brain please do n't bring back the pet rock	5
0	this love ball was very un lovely the messages would not appear clearly in the window no matter how i tried turning it over different ways maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before i received it i put it back in the box and plan to ship it back	5

0	these were a gift to my 5 year old from his grandmother i ca n't return it to her since it would make her feel worse than the worthless product i'm amazed amazon carries them ! a string and two cans would work better	5
1	my two year old has several of these cars and the race track he loves all things cars so these were a big hit all of the shake and go cars talk before they run which he especially likes they are very easy for a toddler to operate but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them too they do n't run for very long per shake but that does n't seem to bother him at all	5

0	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	5
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected about 4 inches long i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package it 's a pull back and go car and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels they were wobbly from then on this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell very dissappointed	5
0	i never imagined i was going to be such a bad experience when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side then the game is complicated and it is not balanced so everybody will choose the dark side because they have advantages dont waste you money buying this game better buy the normal risk acquire or axes and allie	5
0	i bought this toy last year for me son he really did not care for the toy at all but he loves elmo the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast	5
0	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5

1	this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby i 've used this toy in two different setting \( first as a nanny and then as a mom \) and both times the babies were terrified of it it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going unless of course you 've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls \( which seems to be half the fun for them \) good toy but not until maybe 14 months	5
1	bought this one recently for my eight year old \( and myself \) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy	5
1	i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it the price is great right now especially with free shipping she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories more than worth the low price i'm going to stock up on a few more for misc gifts the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories	5
0	what a disaster it takes too long then you get a tiny gross little blob of cotton candy it is quite a mess to clean then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed my 5 year old wants to know how santa 's elves made such a stinky bad toy expect to be disappointed with this one	5

0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	5
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle when my nephews come over they always find these and they 're 5 and 7	5
0	my 4 yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just does n't do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one	5
1	i love light sabers i got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play i bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool this saber is the best you can fight and the saber will not get damage i like it very much i got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight the light saber full extended is like 3 4 of a meter but it do his job the electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment the force be with you	5
0	i am not too happy with this item it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well	5
1	i was happy to order this early so they would n't run out but i later saw the same set at a local store there was only one left on the shelf so i'm glad i ordered them anyway they are my youngest son 's favorite cars to start off with every morning	5

1	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game but once learned it is a lot of fun a good game for four players and a great game for six players it generates lots of lively action with the bidding for the cards we played this game on a cruise with four strangers they were no longer strangers after the game everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it that 's how we got it bought the game after playing with family	5

0	i support the comments that others make this game is so poorly designed it is laughable i cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once forget trying to follow the directions they left out many important rules the board does n't work especially the way the pieces fit into it and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner what is up with that \? forget this game	5
0	compared with the sound sensation blocks i bought together to my 3 month babies this product is almost ignored by them	5
1	we purchased this set for my son christmas 2003 he loves it the age range on the listing is off though it should be the same for any of the little people toys 12 or 18 months and up there are no small parts highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time	5
1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1 and 2 year old children it 's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my 2 year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my 1 year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up	5

0	the pieces of this toy \( the outfits etc \) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet also the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing in general this toy is hokey and cheap i recommend melissa and doug 's magnetic dress up and ormagnetic princess dress up all the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together also the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized	5

1	my daughter really wanted this for christmas she really has played and played with it ever since i wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product	5
0	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within 60 seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise	5
0	big disappointment cheaply made t rex model does not snap together can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded microscope less functional than a magnifying lens volcano is ok the plaster does work but you must provide ingredients for the eruption weather center very very flimsy and breaks i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product supplies for crystals subpar for what is required was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons	5
0	i got this puzzle for my three children \( age 5 4 and 2 \) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds so removing one means it does n't work the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking but why buy a toy which makes you worry \? we were really disappointed	5
0	this game was not engaging my son did not find it interesting he has not asked to play with it again you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance try what 's gnu it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults	5
1	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
0	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over there is only one good thing about it the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going this helped my daughter learn to pedal the constant nose dive however was not worth it do n't buy !	5
0	no wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks it does not work and the quality is sub par i have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst i have seen do not take if it was free garbarge and disappointment await i gave one star because you have to but i would give negitive stars if i could	5
1	i love this playpen ! ! durable plastic can be extended to larger size \( or shortened if going someplace that is not as large \) only problem is that my baby loves to wander she is not thrilled when mommy cages her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary crib toys can be safely attached on the sides \( did that with her aquarium toy which she loves and it soothes her \) occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her i just put her other toys in for her to play with	5
1	i received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift i started to get into sudoku a few months ago while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go there are n't many buttons so it 's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work hope this helps	5
1	this thing is great anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off it will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them funny funny funny ! ! ! ! you can use fairly light objects you can use trip cords and you can use trip cord like devices too and probably much more that i have never thought of good luck good fun and good hunting ! sam kochel p s hope this was a helpful review	5

0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5

0	i brought this because my kids love spongebob ice cream perfect toy right \? wrong ! the ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob 's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone we have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then i have a huge mess left in the kitchen	5
0	my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday she loves tub toys but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water my daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it quot swim quot on the floor i'm a big fan of sassy toys but i 'd pass on this one	5
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play this was how i learned how to play the game i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above \( 90 's style \) unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me	5
1	imaginext dinosaurs' t rex is quite simply fun to play with the dinosaur not only is a great toy with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar it comes with a catapult with its respective stones \( 2 \) that the caveman \( also included with accessories \) can operate to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino my 3 year old picked it up since he got it and he has n't let go	5
1	i found that for the price this set was great ! it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go 3 and a half feet there were also some improvements in the pieces for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set	5
0	i bought this for my boyfriend as a present we both love the tv show and thought the game would be as exciting \( without the live crowd of course \) but the game moves slow no models only picking case numbers you can compete against one another but its not really exciting maybe you should try the board game version it ca n't be any worse	5
1	we all love this toy what i like about it is that it 's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it 's sturdy \( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard \) it looks good not cheap and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes this has been the big hit this christmas even more so than tekno puppy	5
0	when i received the punching nun and removed her from the package her halibut fell off the glue holding her black cape on did n't hold either i would n't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up	5

0	this game fell apart after we got out of the box i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart be careful i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys	5
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection we did n't use it as a game you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them yes the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue would buy this again great for kids with imaginations	5
0	we went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water adding the package of sea monkeys and finally feeding the sea monkeys and nothing happened \( \) hope these are not dead	5
0	this elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night i had to ship the first one back to fp on my own dime to get a new one that one was broken as well ! the cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the abc part does not work this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on ! what a pain ! shoddy electrical work i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat make sure you get this garbage on sale !	5
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for the snow was much grainer than i had expected i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that instant snow was very fine and really looked like snow this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture	5
1	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	5
1	this is a great game ! using clues to get others to say the secret word another great classic game brought back by endless ! a	5

0	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day upon receipt it was not operable the user is supposed to ask the love ball a question and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid	5
0	not only did this phone not work but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up the flashing light was distracting and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all and where the heck was the texting \? \? \? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone but you can only get 0 calls froim it and really limited reception in the mountains switch to a razr as soon as possible	5
1	the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable and the sounds it makes are truly neat my daughter got this over a year ago \( she is 7 now \) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs	5
0	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store it was not worth the money it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better i wish i had known that before i spend 10 on this piece of junk	5
1	whenever we take this bike to the park boys and men of every description crown around it in awe my son who is seven and so far not athletic at all loves the recognition not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching we just wish it came in an adult size	5
1	this train table is a nice size bigger than i expected it went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson 's thomas stuff it seems to be made as well as what i saw at toys r us for double the price	5
1	my 9 month old received this for christmas and loves it ! he is not quite crawling yet he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy so far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze the voice and phrases it says are so very cute too we love the little giggle and when it says hello baby ! ! this is an adorable toy	5
0	this product is terrible the very essence of su doku is logic reasoning this product leaves everything to guesswork i returned it ate the postage was happy to be rid of it ! i then downloaded shareware from the palm store to my palm pilot for 10 could n't be happier	5
1	another nice product from playdough worth the ten bucks or so we just bought this fromamazon this would make a cute birthday present for a young child say 2 to 8 \? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage i would buy this again as a gift	5
0	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead im 11 yrs ol	5

0	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed now the darn thing does not respond to her answers even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock much more fun	5
1	a lot of fun ! the kids really enjoy this updated version of their favorite game product was shipped promptly !	5
0	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1 2 years \( unless small for their age \) my 4 yr old son \( 36lbs \) got it for his birthday and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car but its been parked since broken i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted the plastic seems cheaply made the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well stickers have already started to flake peel off after 1 month consider a bigwheel	5
0	this is a very cute and realistic set the measurements are all accurate the whisk is very dangerous though it is metal one of the things came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away if you buy this item make sure get rid of the whisk !	5
1	my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy when you think it 's pushed down all the way you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise also like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean but overall the toy is fun and very durable	5
0	again the graphics are horrible the mat is boring and not colorful my 3 1 2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b c they are so faded she used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since complete waste of money	5
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play	5
0	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas i would have sent it back if it had not been from santa	5
1	this chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process only draw back there really is n't enough room to track chores for more than one child	5
0	i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway it was the worst gift i 've ever bought please do n't even waste your money trust me check the reviews first now that 's worth it	5
0	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times our version did not include the 5 ways to play as stated on the box \( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch \) my 4 year old who received the gift lost interest after the first time he played both of my boys love the i spy and can you see what i see books this game just was n't challenging enough for them	5
1	yesterday we where buying the christmass presents when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes when i got home i began building it after 6 hours i finished it and when i tried everything was going all right so it was n't that difficult	5
0	i bought this for my 7 year old son it did not take long before the a and b buttons became stuck in the down position the games were not that challenging for a 7 year old but he thought it was great when the a and b buttons fouled up he said it made it more of a challenge dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap	5
0	i received my order today and discovered \( as with all of the hasa products in my order \) that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small 2 1 2 x 1 that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	5
0	gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday it was supposed to be easy to fly it rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight spewing propeller parts everywhere with all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly if you buy this heli do n't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together	5
0	i purchased the havoc heli for my dad he saw an ad for it on tv and wanted one so i was excited that amazon com had it for a lower cost and free shipping however that was as far as the good went my dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the havoc heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it but it had a difficult time flying without any extra weight this helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc but it does make a cute little paperweight	5

0	i cannot believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model \( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! \) after some resistance they agreed to refund me and they did the back wheels are too close together making it very easy to tip over plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable i tried it too in the store on smooth ground but on the sidewalk forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !	5
1	this toy is great for many reasons ! ! tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters you get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers ! each character has point value and rarity if you 're lucky you might get one of the very rare tengamos and sell it for on ebay ! you can also play hundreds of games with the tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack hurry to collect all of series 1 before it is retired for series 2 highly recommended	5
1	my infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets i'm sure she will grow into this toy i do wonder how i'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth	5
1	if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong	5
1	my son calls this a flute and rather than argue we let it go but his little hands have a hard time holding it \( he 's 4 \) even i have trouble i'm right handed and the right hand keys are on the bottom i do n't know if that 's how real clarinets are but it 's awkward also your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play so that 's also a little frustrating but the sound is great and it 's fun to play once you get the hang of it	5
1	the checkbook package was opened no pieces were missing but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift	5
0	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater but a house cave secret hideout restaurant and schoolhouse very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws etc it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it the front panel that the child rest 's his her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater other than the durability factor great product	5
1	i bought this item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great i highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son	5

0	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition however the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see after we opened the cards \( two sets were purchased \) we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside down the cards are also not particularly sturdy these cards appear to be irregulars	5

1	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	5
0	i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer 's description one picture seems to have been deleted now the manufacturer 's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash i trusted that the manufacturer 's description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all it is very simple with vinyl wings be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect	5
0	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection i was wrong it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no mountain of bubbles this product does n't work save your money ! !	5

1	this is the toy with the background music and she 'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance	5
0	all the cut shapes are the same so it 's very easy for my 3 1 2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place the pieces also seem thin and flimsy the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox carrycase all in all the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger the ravensburger thomas giant floor puzzle \( 24 pc \) is a far superior product but no longer complex enough for my kid	5
0	this trike in useless ! our 2yr old tips over every time she tries to ride it buy something that 's worth the money and safer ! now our daughter wo n't go near the thing or any other trike ! i expected much better from radio flyer	5

1	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
0	this is a very cute set however it 's not very well made and the holders are free standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem with kids the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over disappointing	5
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book so the kids like to compare it this product is very durable and will last	5

0	this thing just does n't work do n't bother it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it looks like it would be fun if it worked the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason	5
0	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew and how to thread both top and bobbin threads my daughter received this machine for christmas we threaded it according to directions it sews about 10 stitches then jams i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing and leads to a jam every time do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this	5
0	this item had a description for ages three and up this is n't even close now i'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five year old who is so attached to the fact it 's a batmobile he can get in even if his knees practically knock at his chin that i 'll never pry it from him he 's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months it was a complete waste of money it 's suited for two to three year olds and small four year olds	5
0	do n't waste your time with this thing by the time we invested in the toy the batteries etc we had quite a few dollars into it for about 15 minutes of fun the toy ca n't just be set down on a table so when my son actually gone bored with it \( to my shock because he loves bubbles \) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over yuck mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash this toy is just a gimmick stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money	5
1	my 6 year old loves this yes it is small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right on a shelf when not being played with i would get it again if i did not already have it	5
0	this vehicle is nothing but junk it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a 100 00 toy very disappointed i would like to send it back for a full refund	5
0	my daughter \( 3 at the time \) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs \( 24 total pieces \) i would avoid this game entirely	5
1	i have been in love with this game ever since i first played it was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in chicago since i have moved i keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home it is great for all ages we are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun it does n't matter who wins as long as we play play play we laugh laugh laugh !	5
0	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i cannot tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could	5
1	this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family ! it is very fun and great for little ones too ! i own this game and my family enjoys it very much this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson 's idenity i love this game and i think you would too	5
1	my son absolutely loves his animals he can sit and play with the book for awhile he 's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs it was a great gift and i recommend it ! i do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs	5
1	i like the set up it looks like a daycare really appears it is great to spur on your childs creativity and role playing skills	5
1	this is a great item theres alot going on in such a tiny little space the detail is great from the kraken that can make a boat disappear to the bone cage there 's a collapsing bridge a collapsing building a trap door runaway mill and a cool magnetic boat race and more it comes with jack will norrington and the cannibal chief but no davy that was a little disappointing but anyway its a fun item for all ages	5
0	the board for this game is a pain half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick it takes forever and a day to look in the book locate the letters' locations and uncover them too i love wheel of fortune but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle	5
1	not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother in law ! quite realistic looking ! it works great on smooth surfaces but does n't do well on carpet our dogs got a big kick out of it	5
0	i popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever i even put in a different set up batteries still no dice this is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever i am sorry that i will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill after the reading the other reviews perhaps i am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound i gather that i'm not missing much	5
1	first i have to say thank you to amazon for having this game this was on my daughter 's christmas list and amazon was the only place i could find it second my daughter loves this game and so do her friends they have played the game more than any other she received	5
1	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 we bought a lot of m d toys and this by far was the better of their toys even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out like other said the sound is very appropriate i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful	5
1	you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy \( or wanted a trailer for the truck \) but this is an updated version of the original character as opposed to a remake and is superior in many ways it is durable detailed well articulated and fun especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot i 'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike	5
0	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again \( if you know how to turn the sound off let me know i'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire \) do not buy this toy you 'll be very disappointed in it	5
1	we purchased this game for our son for christmas he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess he has enjoyed the game all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition it is an attractive box we are very pleased with every aspect of it	5
1	transaction went well grandkids are having a blast at using the product innovatively with lots of fun and excitement	5
1	the v4 the newest american tamagotchi is much like its previous japanese counterparts the entama and uratama this tamagotchi goes to school interviews for jobs and then has a career each career has its own game so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail	5
0	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops great height for a small kid but difficult to adjust latch always got stuck also after a few months the latch broke right off now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son now it is just a 30 peice of trash	5
1	i appreciate the previous reviews but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them my family ages 4 6 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game we played until we had a winner \( not too long \) and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner just our opinion but we had a good time	5
0	i bought it for my son to use with the original pixter also and i found what it was compatible with after i realized that it did n't work with the original pixter the box i have says down in the bottom right corner \( if the back of the box is facing you \) of the back of the box in tiny print compatible with pixter plus and pixter 2 0 you would think they would put that on the front	5
1	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way there is a lot more room for more logs 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front i ended up buying additional logs \( not lincoln logs \) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	5
0	we were really excited about this item but have been very disappointed we followed the directions exactly even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks \( which was frustrating and a pain in the neck \) and still we have nothing growing after weeks and weeks of waiting ! rotten thing to do to a kid ! the plastic dome is of decent quality and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller worked out much better this is a total waste of time and money unfortunately	5
0	my 5 1 2 year old son received this for christmas he loves pirates and legos so it seemed a perfect fit we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made and it 's very difficult \( even for an adult \) to get the pieces to stay together imagine how frustrating this is for a child we will never purchase mega bloks products again we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration thanks megabloks	5
1	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it he helps with the house cleaning i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch sprays water and pretend buttons he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet we play iron with the water when i have time this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time sigrid manon blake ramire	5
0	of all the first leappad books to buy make this the last one on your list my daughter has no interest in this one whatsoever ! 60 br 62 60 br 62 \( i have two friends who have said the same thing	5
1	it 's amazing how much a child learns by having access we are an american family living in germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives	5
0	this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close there 's a much better model of an x wing out there do a web search for a company called fine molds it 's a japanese company that makes a finely detailed 1 72 scale x wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle including standing seated pilot figures different droid types it 's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for	5
0	our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity in fact i would like to know this myself	5
0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try i have two complaints with this product one the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone	5
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together	5
0	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third party retailers	5
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy not worth the price would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense	5
0	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review i am extremely disappointed the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola	5
1	love this game with family and or friends it 's one of the best card games around it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention \( you can watch movies talk hang out etc \) yet keeps your interest it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame	5
1	it says some silly things which might not make us laugh but overall a cute toy and kids will like i	5
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey there are no other ones like it they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth they love it	5
0	this is a horrible edition of this game it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all save some money and buy the old boxed editions from or get the newest version you 'll like it a lot more	5
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday he loved it ! but after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it he still plays with it a little bit but not like when it made noise i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month	5
0	this was given to my 2 year old as a present it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with the concept is good all the animals and farmer are built very well but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together	5
0	i love legos however i too was not real impressed with the 50th anniversary tub the lego com websites description of the contents each bucket includes lego system bricks in your favorite lego colors plus a handful of gold colored bricks ! let 's be real we 're talking a child 's handful not adult my daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket another child i know got 4 his brother 5 the duplo set i bought had 6 if you 're buying for the gold bricks it 's not worth the money	5
1	this is a great lego set my 1 1 2 year old son loves them he crashes the truck and caravan all the time and they never break he really likes the bob and cat that come with it these are also the right size to use with the bob click brick sets this truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks	5
1	this was ordered for our 4 year old she just loves it ! very realistic features size of set quality is why fisher price is still the very best for imaginations of all ages ! !	5

1	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory	5
1	lots of fun for young children my kids ages 2 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets	5
0	i recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it did n't work ! i contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and i returned it to them i am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them	5

1	got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she played with well more like laid and stared at now she 's 4 1 2 months old and she still loves it she loves to grab at the fish shake the rattle and twirl the lobster for awhile it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom music is n't too annoying either	5
1	this is a quality product good detail holds air well ready to blow up and hang from attached loop an excellent buy	5
0	a torture device disguised as a toy how would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell \? might as well go lick some dirty socks i think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash hey ma why does slinky go down but not up \? who 's the genius who found this at the scrapyard \? most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind 's perverse craving for repetition and or irritation	5
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it how could i not buy it for him doing that \? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house as he gets older he is liking it more and more	5
1	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the classic collection children of all ages \( and adults \) can build ships planes houses whatever the mind imagines in a variety of colors the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character this is a great product	5
1	i bought this mostly for the container i had individual play doh products like the barber set that came in it 's own box i'm able to put all play doh things into this container and everything is in one spot no more boxes and sorting i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience i'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !	5
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short lived it was nearly impossible to assemble the time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils	5
0	our son received this toy for his first birthday it has a lot of good features teaches colors numbers farm animals and their sounds several songs but the music is awful the singer is off key on every single song \( either that or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice \) as someone who appreciates music i cannot tolerate listening to this especially since there are far better toys out there since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy \( the learning table which has much better quality music and the fridge farm \) we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy	5
0	my 4 year old really wanted this for christmas after looking at similar products we chose this one should have spent the money on the one w the dvd tutu is way too small fits her 18 doll mat is a little too sensitive she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads only 2 instructions feet up feet down on the other arms up arms down bar is n't very stable company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat my daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it	5
1	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it he plays with it just about everyday everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too they all love trying to make baskets the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !	5
0	game did n't work but amazon was very accomodating with a refund including shipping	5
1	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run this was an upgrade add on and well worth it the motorized elevator keeps the action going a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily safe pieces easy construction and good directions fun even for the adults	5
1	the doll looks nothing like the aidan in the movie actually his face is kind of funny looking the movie aidan is cuter the doll could definitely have been made better	5
1	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend the quality is what i expected works fine	5
0	followed all directions added fish within hours the fish were sleeping on the bottom of the tank luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water added fish 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better something is seriously wrong with this tank bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what they are doing great ! do not put fish in the shark tank they will die	5
0	this marble maze looks so fun and cute however it 's actually useless and incredibly frustrating the pieces do n't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them much less when you try to roll a marble through them also the configurations pictured on the box do n't work at all either our giraffe is missing a critical piece or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate ugh i'm returning this immediately	5
1	awesome music and interaction fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs gets the kiddo very involved transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside	5
0	i agree with the other reviews my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift none of the pieces stay together at all how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together why the horse wo n't stand up why the barn doors keep falling off and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it	5
0	although my 3 1 2 yr old loves this belt it barely fits him it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go in fact my 1 1 2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face my son loves it for the brief time it sort of fits him but i am disappointed with the quality and the size	5
1	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list	5
0	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months after the one on christmas morning did not function at all the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days the graphics are straight from 1981 and the dancing princesses even make roboty bendy noises as they move very strange and disappointing	5
1	satisfied with the overall quality of the product also with the purchase process	5
1	makuta is sooooooo cool ! i love his giant staff pitchfork i think he is one of the best bionicles there is ! probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo body special bionicle	5
1	classic durable fun educational for kids of all ages including me	5
0	my 3 year old daughter and i have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand the design is nice it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice however after using it twice the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted this makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place it makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving my daughter was frustrated i eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child i do n't recommend this wand	5
1	my son likes this item the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium the only thing i did n't like about putting this together was the elevator very tight fit and does n't like to go up or down easily but everyone likes playing with it from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds	5
1	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
0	the horse does n't stay hooked on to the carriage too well it always comes apart it 's a pain it 's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing it 's cute to look at but my daughter lost interest in it quickly	5
0	our boys had a good time with this toy but after a 5 6 launches it broke ! not just the wings but the plastic body i feel like it was a waste of money and over priced	5
0	fisher price is selling the same item for only 33 139 99 has to be a mistake	5
0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses even though we purchased it as a play bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams	5
1	this is fun not easy for 5 and under but great for the rest of us \( 7 65 \) gave us alot of laughs	5
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap	5
1	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it his little sister who is two also loves this game this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept there are no complex rules to learn so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off	5
1	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son in law monopolize them with their little competitions these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy	5
0	i am so glad we tested this product ahead of time as a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them these walkie talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet' yes i said feet we gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of midlands do n't waste your money on these	5
1	this is a great pack for a day trip to grandmas it only holds about 4 cassettes so if you have a lot of books you should go with the zipper case other than that my daughter loves it	5
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's the children are learning as they play i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story this educational toy is very engaging the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote	5

0	i have to agree with the other on here i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead i tried and did n't think it was all that fun either i threw the box away and i'm sure i need that to return it if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use	5
1	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3 year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling the ac adapter is a life saver for long car trips just as an aside note the adapter does not look like the one in the picture it is gray and orange like the adapters you seen in the store	5
1	i bought this wireless weather station as a gift the recipient loves it for the price he is really enjoying it the only things he would change are interface to computer so that data could be tracked display of actual barometric pressure valuethese two features are available on more expensive models so i imagine in the future we will be upgrading	5
1	i got this for the price 4 99 i put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it the first thing she asks me in the morning will you play mermadia with me mommy \? pretty please \? the parts come off easily but do not fall off my daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her she loves it	5

1	my son wanted this piece and we have enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so i have to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to our geo trax railroad	5
1	we bought two sets of the alphabet foam play mats so glad we did ! we have a concrete basement floor and now the kids have a nice colorful and soft place to play plus the foam floor is n't as cold as the concrete wer 're in colorado the colors are great so inviting the pieces fit together perfectly and the border gives it a finished look great purchase ! we 'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area !	5
0	i was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use however the new type of valve does not hold in the air it says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one i bought would not stay in and when i tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated it would have been perfect had the valve worked properly	5
0	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store or they ran out of color at the factory my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one not like the box or commercial !	5
1	my 3 year old loves this toy he has a lot of the krypto toys and getting mechanikat was essential we just got it for christmas so am not sure of its longevity it does seem to be pretty well made also got snooky wookems with it great for fans of the krypto cartoons	5
0	my daughter bought this with birthday money and it jammed on the first day she played with it we ca n't get the sticker roll out and she is very disappointed do n't bother with this toy buy a better one made for scrapbooking the look on my daughter 's face when this broke was heart breaking	5

0	this seemed like a great idea but it does n't work very well for cloth diaper users like me i use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs however since my cloth diapers wo n't fit into the diaper organizer i'm not sure what to put there because of this there is a lot of wasted space i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers	12
0	i will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed ! they need to repackage items like this for shipping it it the second and the last item of this type i will order online the other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed i have complained before but never get a response too bad too as i like amazon	12
0	the bumper was very cute and colorful and i was excited to put it on the baby 's crib until i put it on no matter how i tried to fit it onto the crib \( it is a white spindle jenny lind crib full size \) it fit very akwardly and never quite right there were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib i was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts	12
1	this is an excellent product it is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about sids i felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib and that she would n't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats i was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material we even had family members that thought that someone had made the cribshield for us	12
0	the monitor is ok but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new channel and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby 's room not on the parent unit ! ! ! also we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static broken signal \( only to be reset by changing the channel \) and no signal overall i am very disappointed it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly and i am goig back to my old one	12
0	i bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born it is awful ! it gives strange readings like 94 5 and 95 1 when in fact i know that she has a fever ! i bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings do n't buy this its a waste of time and	12
1	i bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and i 'd have to say the reviews i read about on the titan were dead on my 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using i also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward i can still use this seat i wish i had bought this seat from the get go	12
0	very poor construction and does not fit most sleigh cribs as advertised on the box this company should be ashamed of themselves for charging 70 for this product the concept is a good idea and could be so much better but this company fails in execution tots in mind definately has something in mind however it is not your tots buyer beware	12
0	i would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks the walker seemed great for the price it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it unfortunately the design is terrible on the sounds n'lights feature it began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it after much frustration trying to get to the battery compartment to replace it we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all the internal battery is soldered in place once it loses it 's original charge you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby	12
1	the pack and play netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your pack and play outside the netting keeps the bugs out ! it is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag it also fits easily over the graco pack and plays	12
1	my son is tiny born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie i simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this it keeps his entire body in place not just his head it provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm \( we havnt used the other side yet \) my only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny once he s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem	12
0	we bought this product so that i could see my 6 month old son from the front seat but everytime i put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face the blinds do n't stay up either their suctions do n't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door	12
0	my husband and i purchased this set with my first son but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son the difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks sometimes more than that it is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling i hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings	12
0	well we ordered this for a trip and it 's delayed even though it says it 's in stock we got a vauge email that says delayed but no promise of delivery do n't order it from amazon if you 're exhausted chasing an escaping baby ! go to a local store and purchase it waiting waiting waiting	12
0	an ok gadget but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well it does not have an automatic shut off so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	12
1	this jogger is great i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo	12
0	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy i will say our child is a bright out going 8 month old now but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea but began to realize that many of the bright gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system it is loud to wear and not so comfortable you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening good luck if you choose to purchase but just think einstein was fine with out one	12
1	this crib is well built and functional the drawer is a nice and convenient feature the finish is good for an inexpensive crib assembly was easy with good instructions included we plan on using this crib for our next baby as well	12
1	we like this stroller it seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability \( shoulder strap \) make it ideal for trips especially in airports my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall \( 6'4 \) but it is fine for me \( 5'3 \) we like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice overall a good stroller for the price	12
0	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive well i learned my lessen you get what you pay for like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw if you will closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie i hope this will work out much better	12
1	to bring the co sleeper up to the height of the bed these leg extensions are the best bet yes as someone else said they do make it a little shaky so if you are not planning to attach the co sleeper to your bed you may want to leave the height alone \( you 'll be getting up anyway so it probably does n't matter how tall it is \) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap rather than free standing it was very secure	12
1	we looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we 've found i love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down it stores flat and that you can add as many toys as you want our baby has really enjoyed it there is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time	12
1	i just purchased this crib bedding the quality is great i love the thickness and the velour worth the money	12
1	my son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver ! when i wrap him in it he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time he can easily break out of the swaddle me but not the miracle blanket i am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends ! !	12
0	i bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant i wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat watch tv or drink his sippy cup this chair was the perfect height design and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky the problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip the fault is in a joint i bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when i packed but then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two that joint is really weak too bad ! it 's such an adorable product	12
0	this is o k if you 're using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	12
1	i like this sheet so much better than the thin ones it offers more padding and seems so much more comfy ! it is a tight fit but i had no problem fitting the sheet onto my eddie bauer pack n play so i would assume it should fit any pack n play just make sure to wash in cold water and hang dry i never put this in the dryer the only thing i do n't like is the color it happens to match my navy blue playard but i wish it came in some lighter colors	12
0	looked nice at the store thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch until we got home and tried to use it the head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat the velcro is not strong enough i would not buy this product again	12
1	i am sure this is a good stroller \( that 's why i bought it ! \) my review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive do n't be fooled usually ships within 24 hours really means may ship sometime as of 2 8 06 our stroller has not arrived it was ordered january 1 2006 it is not even slated to ship for another week \( we 'll see \) meanwhile the local store has several in stock my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time	12
0	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin i wo n't ever use it again	12
1	i 've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor we have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference i 've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception i think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it	12
1	would someone be able to give me the dimensions measurements for this mattress \? thanks so much ! i do not have this however it made me put in a rating in order to post a question	12
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
1	i bought this as a gift ca n't give much opinion she told me she loved them so i give it 5 stars maybe that 's not a fair review but it 's breast pads they are always useful ! lo	12
1	my mother in law bought these for my daughter at first i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be but my daughter took to them right away in the beginning she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up they wo n't entertain her for hours but she 's always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day	12
0	i was so excited when i recieved this humidifier at my baby shower but after several tries i finally returned it this product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically well the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on my baby wakes up crying ! ! ! note that i live 2 miles from an airforce base and the planes do n't even wake her ! ! ! ! do n't buy this product	12
0	i do n't care what other reviewers say but this bed rail sucked ! ! i used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed it took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed and it would constantly come unlocked and if i buy another bed rail for our next child it wo n't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty i ca n't remember if this cover was removable or not if it was i'm sure it would have been a pain in the a to remove	12
1	i love this chair we have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well i have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves	12
1	seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical ! my niece absolutely loved them she had such an easy time handling them because they are her size which is unusual all other instrument toys are so much larger and it 's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them ! the smiles and giggles are worth everything	12
0	this monitor did n't work for us at all ! we heard a lot of static and the alarm would go off too it would n't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen the alarm was always going off	12
0	we received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery it worked the first time but never again ! i repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working it just would not turn on ! ! ! ! ! i asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period i then sent a email to the first years explaining the situation and never received a reply lousy product !	12
0	i was very disappointed with this pump it was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks and i only used it once a day even more disappointing was the companys return policy you have to ship it to them at your expense wait for them to send you a new one and return that one to the store do not waste your time	12
0	i love this product in the fleece but this is so light weight it defeats the purpose	12
0	these bowls are not worth the money they do not stay on the table at all !	12
0	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range well i have problems similar to sara 's when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear that 's why i gave it a 2nd star this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	12
0	just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions i find the customer reviews a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on grandma needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything ! thanks to all of you again !	12
1	we were very pleased with how easy this was to install despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters ours is actually a half wall and half banister but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge the directions were n't great but it was fairly self explanatory we feel much more comfortable letting our one year old play upstairs in the loft now	12
1	we live in the cold rainy northwest part of the country this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat he stays warm and protected in the bundle me this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby it is a must for winter babies it is well worth the money	12
1	my granddaughter is one year old she absolutly loves her new walker she is small for her age so the adjustable height is perfect	12
1	we 've had this toy for around 3 years now my second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn ! it is also a hit with other children visiting our house the toy is as educational as it is fun ! we 've used it to practice colors shapes and musical creativity it can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run 20 new all in all a fantastic toy well worth the price ! another upside is how friendly and helpful the neurosmith company is we lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement my friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much	12
1	my son loves these blocks we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set he loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them	12
0	we went through three of these before we finally gave up our poor baby was crying and we did n't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night i luckily am a light sleeper also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near we bought a cheaper safety first brand and have not had any problems	12
0	the biggest disappointment was that after 6 months the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole maybe in the seams \( thus patch would not work \) kel gar does not warranty the product and the store that the tub came from \( via amazon \) only offered a 90 day warranty also the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub the rest flows behind it thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill	12
1	use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening one minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile all and all it is a very good product	12
0	rather than this sling i recommend you check out for your sling they are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors this is a far better buy than the native baby carrier	12
0	the seat is fun to play with but that is also the problem my son was so distracted with the features and songs he never sat still long enough to go to the bathroom	12
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	12
1	i love this key and cell phone set so much i'm buying another one for a friend i looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall my 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone \( actually even my older kids think it 's pretty neat \) great product great price	12
0	i have looked everywhere and there are no probe covers to be found anywhere ! who would sell a 30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times ! this is insane if anyone finds them please let me know where i have checked babysrus usa baby wal mart target walgreens snyder 's drugstores every grocery store every discount store every drugstore i have been to in two states over the last 3 months this is crazy i recommend not getting it	12
1	i bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features overall i am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it but few things i wish it had is one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention overall for the price it is good	12
1	such a great product for my baby she loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time it builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together the plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands such a winne	12
1	this is a great price for a 4 pc set \( i got ours at walmart for 35 \) the comforter is not thick and plushy its very thin and stiff but then again for the price its ok the sheets are adorable we bought a very soft fuzzy dora blanket to go with it but the comforter that comes with it is definately cute maybe after a few washes it will soften up some i would still buy it again for the price but if you are looking for a thick soft warm comfoter then this is not the one you want	12
1	i would like to ditto \( and thank ! \) the reviewer who suggested the cvs brand covers after reading her review i purchased the covers from cvs com then i thought about checking at walgreen 's and sure enough they carry them \( same price as cvs 40 for 5 99 \) i just picked up a box today so i will soon have a bunch of covers but i do n't care i just love this thermometer i actually have the one with the light on it outstanding product	12
0	my son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long he wasnt the tiniest baby i tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing it 's the worst product ever i am definitely not using it and will probably donate it to goodwill	12
0	the idea for this product is great the problem is with its design and or choice of materials regarding the buckles the buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex this caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place they instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage if another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect	12
1	i have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age we love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry just make sure the suction cup is wet and it wo n't fall off the wall sizewize it 's basically a perfect fit in our tub which is slightly tapered from head to toe but i could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub	12
0	this carrier did n't survive one airline trip the bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip this carrier is junk waste of my money	12
0	i bought the avent bottles when i was pregnant because they were babiesrus 's best pick yeah right ! i wonder how many are returned on a daily basis aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking ! i would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money	12
1	love it love it love it ! no more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty lint covered binkies it could be a little bigger for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it 's a great idea	12
1	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
1	i received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver how nice that i can monitor my baby 's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute ! the are two different channels so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off sometiems it 's also just a matter or re positioning the monitor to resolve the noise we were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls but switching to channel b solved that i 've used the evenflo whisper connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied	12
1	this lock gives piece of mind it 's easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open it 's sturdy and does n't require drilling into any cabinetry i started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house	12
0	this seemed like the original johnny jump up i had for my first child 13 years ago we loved that one so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it did n't work very well it just did n't seem as springy as it should be i ended up returning it and getting the 40 version with the tray instead \( the jump go \) people have complained about the tray pinching baby 's fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier also our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot	12
0	i have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time i reached home	12
0	this is the worst pump you could buy i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work please do n't waste your money i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product	12
1	the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful animal images are unusually cute i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up	12
0	there was a crack down the side where it was put together and nicks in the wood we didn't have time to send it back and they only offered us 20 oo for a discount very dissastisfied ! will never order form here agai	12
1	this bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble it is a great buy for the price you ca n't go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together	12
1	i am surprised to read that people do n't like this mirror we have had it since our son was 1 mon and we still use it at 7 mon we have a trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his britax marathon carseat it has been great for road trips \( our son was entertained even on a 9 hour trip \) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store we do n't always use the music lights but the mirror is always handy we have never had trouble with it being too soft i have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well def recommended	12
1	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers he just wont sit in them so this product was our solution for him when we are out it is small but my son \( 20 months old \) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere	12
0	i thought this cover was horrible it does n't cover enough area of the cart it 's difficult to put on because of all the ties i could n't even get the harness to fit right try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic you can put them on the cart with one hand and it completely covers the cart even the big ones at costco	12
1	what a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter when my son wants me to play a game puzzle or play on the floor i just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time i have also found it helpful when i fold laundry i can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what i am doing it props the baby 's head up just enough better than just laying flat on the floor the lounger also cradles the baby i wish that i had found this when my son was a baby i recomend this lounger to every new mommy	12
1	when registering for baby needs i laughed at the idea of wipes warmer i thought what a waste ! after my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes i rethought this this product has been a life changer ! baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great easy to use the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out remember to purchase the pop up wipes however great product i would give as a gift	12
0	this is by far the worst sling i have ever tried ! the padding is bulky and hot it is impossible to adjust total waste of money i bought a pouch from www equanimitybaby com and it was perfect ! easy to use and very comfy the bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk if you ca n't use this sling its not you its the sling	12
1	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often at just 14 months she could jump with both feet off the ground it is a quality product at a reasonable price would highly recommend	12
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12
0	i have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and i am not impressed my daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas i experimented with the dr brown bottle and the playtex vent air both seemed to help but the playtex is by far the best people complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable	12
0	i installed this mirror in our car two days ago today it was in my daughter 's lap when i went to get her out of the car the mirror broke off from the base i bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors \( suction cup attachment etc \) i would not recommend this product	12
1	i love this cover because it is so comfy for the baby ! i have had my boppy for almost a year now and i used it the whole time i nursed my baby love it	12
0	i bought this to take my infant 's temperature since she does n't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm i decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate and it never gave the same reading twice first it was 95 5 and then 98 5 and then 96 2 etc i tested it on myself my daughter and my husband then i gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe i just was n't doing it correctly and he had the same results i have taken it back to target and am trying a different brand do not waste your money on this product	12
1	this is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks i had more leaks with disposables we are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes i am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth and delighted with the ease of use of this product	12
1	if you 're going to get the baby bjorn potty chair you 've got to get a matching stool ! i love how the stool has a rubbery grip top to prevent slipping my son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair you 've gotta get one now	12
1	perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome for the price it has alot to offer it has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes it 's not the plushest stroller however for travel or quick errands it 's perfect for us	12
0	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud	12
1	my little guy loved this from the start this is a versatile toy that lasted many months the mat is machine washable so it became our take along for travel the hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows he 's now 2 yrs and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room ! this was a great investment	12
1	this is a great light shines stars all over the room constellations are n't quite right but they 're close the different color options are great for the price it 's a great deal	12
0	i did n't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out and it does take standard garbage bags after a few months of use the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off i assembled it back together and within a few days the spring broke in half i tried to get another spring by calling safety first they only had the blue top without the spring the guy said i 'd just have to buy another pail if i wanted a working pop top	12
1	the size is bigger than i thought but i loved it my son fits in nicely	12
0	do not like this productit is very hard to get rail under bedpops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac	12
0	my daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times ! i am returning it first thing in the morning i should have never let her on it a second time if she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over please do not buy this product	12
0	i found the product highly unsafe as a stroller the handle is very flimsy and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller also the wheels do not lock properly and safely its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	12
1	i just love our snack trap cups ! my 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys doing it himself they 're great for shopping driving or anywhere ! absolutely no spills ! highly reccommend this product ! happy mom of 1 so fa	12
0	does n't dry your bottles at all it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely i give it one star for all the stuff it holds but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it	12
1	this is a super cute bath toy my daughter enjoys putting her toys into the sink and then pulling them back out again she also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this love it	12
1	when i had my daughter i had no clue where to begin with breast pads so i bought several different types a friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite i wish i had never wasted money on the other pads i did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands it was worth it because they were so much more comfortable i did n't have any chaffing like with most others also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive	12
1	this is a great potty for boys we had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty in the potty easy to clean too	12
0	you have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria especially if you are wiping then put your hands back in to get another wipey	12
1	i received this as a baby shower gift from my mom and love it ! it is so easy to manuever you can do it with one hand the stroller has ample space for bags purse etc below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items the drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus the material is so pretty and the colors are great the best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather i would highly recommend this item	12
1	we love this tub still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old the incline position is great when they are n't quite ready to sit on their own we used to just place this over our kitchen sink give her baths there now we place it inside our regular bathtub because she is n't quite ready to be in the big tub yet	12
0	after trying almost every bottle i tried these and waht a nightmare ! there are to many parts to clean and they leak ! i called dr brown 's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it you have to stir it as most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula i saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them i went with the playtex natural disposables and never looked back	12
1	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on he would n't use that potty but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it the bjorn is shaped perfectly with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee it 's so comfy that he will sit and read a book ! looks great too simple and easy to clean	12
1	if anyone asked me what baby product i would have to have it would be this product ! i love it and it is very comfortable to use one negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well so do n't let your child use it because they could slip i would purchase it again and would give it as a gift	12
1	i registered for this item as one of those i would n't buy it but it 's a nice thing to have i did receive it and am so glad i did my son loves this ! ! he gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger i would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if i needed them	12
1	this seat along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well	12
1	my daughter was flying to virginia beach virginia to see her husband off to kuwait where he is serving our country she flew alone with two toddlers one still in diapers i had bought her a jeep brand double umbrella stroller i purchased this to free her hands up and help her navigate the airport alone now that she is home she has raved repeatedly how super helpful this item was it was thee most helpful item i purchased for he	12
1	this is great for young babies once my son became more active \( which is when it 's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway \) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it 's very thin unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w a crib set i think that is the only flaw but i will definitely use it again for my next infant baby	12
1	best stroller we own our top of the line graco and jeep strollers sit in the garage now ! it is very light weight easy to use and folds up very neat and tidy	12
1	i agree with the above reviewers this rug is large and very well made perfect in any little girl 's room	12
0	i did n't like these for a few reasons they take up too much room in my freezer they take too long to thaw i do n't care for the avent isis pump i have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and i can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker	12
0	i would not recommend this crib mattress pad i followed the washing instructions prior to first use and the pad would not fit on the mattress when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore luckily amazon took it back	12
0	bought this crib tent after reading all the fine print about returns besides toilet seats etc which allegro medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons allegro medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days not when i tried to return this allegro medical said all returns were up to their discretion they would not allow me to return this despite the fact i did n't even open the box very misleading will never buy from allegro medical again	12
1	i like this product it is very stylish and lightweight definitely i highly recommend to anyone	12
1	we have a very small kitchen so i knew i could never have a large highchair i registered for the healthy chair by fisher price but after putting my son in it once to try it out i returned it for this one and never regretted it this one has a higher back reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable \( the one i have is better than the one shown i bought it at babiesrus \) it actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc 123 plastic mats that go on the tray my son is very comfortable in it and i love that we can take it anywhere	12
0	we purchased storkcraft 's rochester stages crib in natural aspen changing table 5 drawer dresser 3 drawer dresser 2 side units \( left and right \) and a hutch every single piece of furniture that we 've gotten from storkcraft is damaged in some way nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces on the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked it 's obvious that storkcraft has no quality control we 're in the process of deciding whether or not we 're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and or a new unit all i'm going to say is do n't waste your time on purchasing storkcraft furniture	12
1	this is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters i ca n't believe we did n't buy it sooner it 's easy to clean and does n't slide off the chair our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy it even has a little carrying bag to take on trips great vendor with quick delivery too	12
0	it does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water it is worse if you use tap water it does n't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed when you lift the cap all the water drip you will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use the plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat you wonder if it is going to melt i am a fan of gerber products but this one does not work	12
0	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing	12
1	great fun product my baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min couple times a day we own it from 2 months he was 4 months old he simply loves it he jumps and plays with the toys absolutely the best buy	12
1	we just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters they 're great they 're strong enough to keep our 11 month old baby from falling through we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened i still intend to watch him carefully when he 's up there but these will definitely protect him in an emergency just be sure to follow directions tie them tightly ! ! they 're not that bad looks wise either i can still see my spindles through the netting so the look of the stairway is basically unchanged of course looks are less important than safety ! i think i'm going to get these for our outdoor deck as well i 'd recommend them	12
0	i tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed the suction wo n't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table on the kitchen counter top \( formica \) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal i am returning mine to the store today dissapointing but they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature	12
1	this is the bmw of all highchairs it 's super sturdy and the italian leather seat is easy to care for ignore the reviews about being a pain to clean you need to clean every highchair nooks crannies and all	12
1	i brought this walker for my grandson and he loves it he alway 's playing with the objects and is actually walking now this wallker was easy to assemble also	12
1	our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first but now that she 's 4 months old she loves this toy ! we recommend it !	12
1	the best bib around ! wash and dry and large enough to catch everything i will never again use another bib	12
1	we have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece they are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market they are made well stand up to a lot of washing and are soft and comfortable for baby the dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months not for a newborn we started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night all you need over pj 's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable a great night 's sleep for all !	12
1	this carseat is a good value the pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow i did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that 's expected in a 4 month old it reclines far enough that her head does n't fall forward and it 's so simple to adjust the straps overall very nice carseat for the money i spent	12
1	i highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born if you plan on breastfeeding i was very sore in the first few weeks the shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings i did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks but they got me through those weeks when i do n't know if i 'd have made it otherwise ! they were a wonderful product for me	12
1	there is a place for everything in this drying station i use wide mouth bottles and it 's a little tight on space but it works great for me it 's convenient on the counter when i have to grab a bottle for the baby	12
1	i am impressed with this seat ! this seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet the training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes pottyprincess pottypirate pottypony and pottysaurus i called the free line \( 87 pottypal \) and was able to buy the stool \( a little cheaper than amazon 's set \) and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards i am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product	12
1	this is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids this is a pretty boring product but everything worked just fine	12
1	i like this because it is a nice construction i bought the white and it blends in nicely i just wish it was a little higher we have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now	12
0	we actually went through two of these in two weeks the first one cooked the bottom 20 wipes so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective the second one did the exact same thing ! we wasted so many wipes with this warmer since they were cooked we have even emailed the company and sent them pictures but never heard back from them save your money	12
0	i wish i would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these are flimsy thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter i'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad fortunately there are other products that work better if this was the only option i might as well not have a sheet on at all	12
1	this 2 in 1 is amazing the scent is wonderful too bad they do n't make it for adults \) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products try them and you 'll see why	12
1	it 's very safe because of the non slip rubber our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes to the potty nice color too highly recommended ! !	12
0	besides the fact that the straps where n't long enough to hold on to my son crib it ended up on the floor every other day ! ! ! save your money and do n't buy it ! ! !	12
1	these are the greatest invention in bottles ever these bottles helped my daughter so much no more gas no spills or leaks the only downside is they are hard to clean but who cares	12
0	i loved the idea that this car seat was then after i bought it i have had problems with it the handle realse has broken many times then the gray handle part has came apart also this is has not been safe at all i went to return it and target would not return or exchange it for me i think it was a waste of money	12
1	this works great with our chicco capri stroller it took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close however once i figured that out it was great i could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed the swivel is a great concept i actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder \( one on each side \) and mommy could have her water bottle clip we just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles	12
0	they are messy when they opened i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much i do n't have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it 's like 17 for ten	12
0	we got 2 of these and had the same problem with both the cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package after washing it as directed it has gotten even worse it has strings hanging all over it it 's a very useful item but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! a friend of mine had the same problem and she recommends the especially for baby brand \( less expensive and better quality \)	12
0	i received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow although the tag reads 100 cotton it is most certainly not the soft 100 jersey cotton advertised the print is cute but i was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling i gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising but if one is looking for a nice regular cotton crib sheet this would probably be okay	12
0	i could n't wait to get it i got so excited when it finally arrived ! so i used it right away ! sooo disapointed ! it did not get anything out at all it is soooo weak ! the one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from target and it works ! but this nasal clear is no good do not buy it	12
1	i was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub she loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills the only down side is that the crayons get a bit mushy after a bit of time in the water but it the baby einstein crayons are a good replacement which are inexpensive as well i look forward to many van gogh s from her	12
1	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
0	i tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable you didnt even have one walker availiable how is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker \? i was very disapionted i guess that i would have to rate you with a zero and i would like to know when will there be any walkers available \? i like to shop with amazon	12
0	this item is packaged very poorly you have to literally rip the box apart to open it i did this twice and both times the very last item was completely cracked in half very inconveniently shipped and packaged	12
0	if you research the toxic gas theory for crib death \( which has been around for 15 \? years \) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can this product is not safe at all no matter what they call it get a babesafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby and use only 100 cotton on top of that \( between your baby and the mattress cover \) do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100 cotton blankets run from this product	12
1	this was a baby shower gift and although the baby is still too little to use it i can say that it is exactly as described and the parents were thrilled to receive it	12
1	this is so much better than any potty chair and it is never in the way ! very easy to put on and my daughter loves it ! she ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also ! !	12
0	this is an okay product with many many parts to clean the spout the ring for the top of the cup the handles and the plastic leak stopper oh and the cup ! all the parts fly around the dishwahser i 've lost many stoppers so i 've had to order through avent the good thing is they do n't leak	12
0	i would n't let my dog sleep on these sheets they are of the worst quality imaginable we took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit perfectly i recommend the koala baby name brand porta rib sheet they are available at bru and have elastic all the way around making for a snug fit and the quality is 1000 times improved over the pnp sheets	12
1	our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat we love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding i was looking forward to the reclining feature as well but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature	12
1	this is a very useful item it looks great and holds a lot of stuff you can also carry it around from room to room	12
0	i agree with rebecca bravados are more simple more flexible and more comfortable	12
1	we love this item i was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink this item solved the problem highly recommended	12
0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week the prima pappa is comfortable and secure in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles	12
0	this product is great but do not buy it from bp medical you cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund they charge a 15 restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase	12
0	i ordered a kidco elongated child gate a recommended extension needed to be purchased the wrong extension was sent i needed g24 model and received 24 extension for a different model	12
0	1 they leak2 too expensive3 they do n't supply enough lids so you have to buy more containers4 does n't work well for feedin	12
1	love it ! fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it	12
0	the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place i would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected	12
1	heats milk and food esecially when frozen i use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food i 've made	12
1	this seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for suvs in contrast to one of the other reviews \( and i am not affiliated with the seat manufacturer \) this seat does the job adequately and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs measurements fit etc imho there is no quot universal quot seat saver or for that matter car seat that will fit every car this one manages to catch most of the itty bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat and hence serves its purpose well	12
1	was a snap to put together very soft for baby moves with ease takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller but that 's the only problem	12
1	my son was a very fussy bottle eater he would never finish his bottle until i switched to a faster flow nipple now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater he became frustrated that the milk was n't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect he is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding	12
0	though this potty is nicely priced it 's worth it to buy a more expensive one though mine has n't fallen apart like other reviewers it does shift around on the base allowing for spillage the removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat so my daughter gets stuff all over the inside not just in the receptacle the inside has a criss crossed honeycomb type pattern \( see my customer image \) so it 's impossible to clean messes out of it it does serve it 's purpose as a potty but i'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one	12
1	bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room the entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly works well looks good and feels solid highly recommend for this use	12
1	this potty seat is the only toilet training item i have bought i highly recomend it ! my daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty you need a step stool for them to get up on their own i like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb 3 ft 2 yro climbing up situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal this product i feel helps get to that goal	12
1	you do n't need the whole kit only the loop and latch is needed if you use the plastic it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing this way you can use the softfit breastshield too	12
0	this worked great for a couple months then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise the gears must be slipping my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying really sad	12
1	you will need this extra base ! ! i ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have the day after it arrived my mother in law was sick and could n't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up i had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened	12
1	i use the medela pump but their thin bottles and simple caps do n't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh i love the heavy advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle	12
0	the nail clippers hairbrush and comb are great but i did not care for the rest it would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company	12
1	it works really well it 's stable \( the little guy is trying to climb \) and holds a lot	12
1	i got this tray for my son 's daily rides in the car and it has been terrific ! he can eat on it put his sippy cup into the cup holder and be totally independent he can also play on it cars crayons etc and it holds his books too after approximately 9 months of constant use it cracked \( it is very stiff of course but i do n't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked \) worth the money as far as i am concerned	12
0	i just logged in to see this item 's price so that i could price ours for the consignment sale neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time and this did n't help that at all	12
0	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage i'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend \( great proper latch ! \) and treatment for a mild yeast infection hope this helps	12
0	i thought this product would be helpful for sleeping since it was recommended from a friend however it does n't work for me i took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag after trying it for 5 minutes i decided that i did n't like it and tried to return it the company would only issue store credit because i opened it what a rip off	12
0	we bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she 's teething one day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip ! we let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she 's older	12
0	i purchased this item from target and had to return it to the store the wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam and the foam is inserted into the cover the foam is n't the problem it 's the cover the zipper goes right down the middle so it ca n't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head neck i would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece if the zipper were on the side the product would be great	12
0	i bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck this item was made for a portable small crib not your typical crib i had to go out and spend another 40 on velcro so i can make it long wide enough to fit my son 's crib it is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib do n't waste your money on something that is not going to work	12
1	we have had this puzzle toy since my son was one \( he 's 3 now \) it has provided hours of entertainment and education we started by just showing him a few choices and matching now he can easily do the whole box himself and enjoys it i like the textures vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces the nice sturdy box to hold them is great too	12
1	this pillow is the best ! after sleeping with it the first night i new i could n't be without it my husband bought it for me and i am so thankful i left it at my mother 's house one night and i could not sleep i keep waking up the night after getting it back i slept like a baby again if you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this ! its very soft and you can take the cover off to wash it	12
0	my 2 1 2 year was interested in this seat right away much more so than his small potty however he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard he gets wet the floor and his step stool are all wet clean up is a nightmare it 's in the trash now	12
1	my daughter plays with this toy at grandma 's house theses quot instruments quot are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with the bright colors and different noises definitely interest her she loves to shake them and make noise they are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you 're on the go	12
0	i bought this potty seat for my daughter and i took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets the second i put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet ! the seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets that is a lie my toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through a waste of money and a safety hazard	12
1	i did a lot of online and store researching before i bought this seat for my 3 1 2 year old son my one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children well now i can say it works well for slim ones as well he loves the arm rests and the cup holder it is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary we liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	12
0	i had this when my daughter was first born it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up in it when she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped luckily i had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything i was able to return the product but i bought the snugli carrier instead i would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles	12
1	these are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself whenever we are out at a restaurant i just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table who knows what they wipe those tables with \? ! this is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on	12
1	i have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs the gates are attached to the walls i have not had any problems with the either gate for those of you searching for a gate for a dog the gate works will with by 70 pound boxer	12
0	i thought that this bathtub would be the best thing because of the shower and spa feature but the shower is so hard to use it 's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time you also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling beacause it 's just not positiioned right it sits too high up and she just looks uncomfortable on it you also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit it was n't worth 40 the sling and the spa and shower unit is n't useful or helpfula t all	12
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	12
0	i was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by i tried it out with a baby doll first and i ended up covering the snuggle nest with my blankets in the middle of the night	12
1	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby i'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold very good quality product	12
0	i just took a course from the florida highway safety program i thought something like this would be wonderful especially for little ones in the rear facing position i was dead wrong anything put in front of on the side of in fact anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash this toy even latched down poses a threat to the baby he or she may just have to be bored for a while on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment	12
1	this product works well with my dr brown 's bottles there are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks i use a sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it wo n't scratch the bottles though the sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	12
0	this is the worst monitor ! i thought being digital monitor it would be great i was totally wrong ! i could n't even get it to work ! do n't waste your	12
0	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same other covers i 've seen just slip on this one has to be tied on also it does n't cover the entire cart there is an opening that my baby 's fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle not a great product spend the extra money and buy the better one	12
1	i bought elmo underwear from ebay with a sports theme and was done training in a couple of weeks the real underwear incentive did the trick so then i bought more underwear as a reward i got wiggles thomas the tank and nemo underwear from ebay	12
0	i bought this pump because it had the medela name and i thought it was reliable i was wrong this is the worst pump in the world everything the other poster said is true this is the worst breastpump i would not recommend this breastpump to anyone	12
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12
0	this stroller is way to heavy too long steering is very difficult and too bulky it is huge when folded try something else	12
1	this is a great pack'n'play it 's easy to set up and take any place the bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that i have the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby 's attention my only problem is the piece for the top whenever i try to use it the arms bow in and it does n't look very sturdy i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground it just does n't seem very sturdy and i have tried everything other than that i am glad that i bought this !	12
0	i just bought this seat for my 9 month old son i bought it for the convenience of the fold down front as good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees he is a thin baby so i do n't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby also the seat it self is slippery i have to place a rag down before i put the baby in because he will slide forward if i do n't this is very uncomfortable for him unfortunately this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier that is really the only good thing i can say about this product	12
0	hard to install ridiculously confounding installation directions and when you 're done it 's flimsy do n't waste your money	12
0	loved our marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat since this happened he 's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place just by loosening the harness although a highly rated seat i would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product i have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this not very happy	12
1	my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo this set is adorable and practical he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl th eonly thing to be ware of is it gets very hot in the microwave even if you just put it in for 20 seconds it must cool dow	12
0	this thermometer is not very accurate or consistant whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and i knew that it could n't be right we would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice i even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95 1 ! we got rid of this one because fever induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate it has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best	12
0	loved the car seat until my daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps i would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat that is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat	12
1	seemed like a great system i came with two universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once if you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment it does not fit my aria twin stroller because the aria does not have any tubing anywhere available once you close it up \( and not much available once it 's open	12
1	i bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all i love the color the material is easy to wash and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable i have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly my only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months the bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving other than that what you see is what you get ! worth every penny ! ! !	12
1	i really liked this swing i have the older model papasan swing nothing was wrong with it i just wanted the new model i loved the pink and the fact that i could plug it in	12
0	i hate hate hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy	12
0	i'm currently in the process of adopting my son and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited it never worked it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up needless to say it 's been sent back i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing	12
0	our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges would n't stay in place i love the idea but it just did n't work for us	12
1	my son loves this toy although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color he is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy a good buy and will keep them busy	12
1	these are the best bibs i have tried many they do not peel crack etc i have used the same set of bibs for 2 years i just bought a set for my sister worth the money	12
1	what a great product no tools just click click click and it 's ready to use the anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress the frame is metal not plastic ! i am very pleased with the quality and the look it was out of the box and on the bed in about 10 minutes	12
0	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable but i do n't quite get how to adjust this it also says that there is a blanket maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1 2 inches thick i'm pretty disappointed i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems	12
0	we received this item as a xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken my two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor the legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item we were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a step 2 product	12
1	i purchased this product for my hubby 's vehicle and we love not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time it works great highly recommended	12
0	do n't buy peg perego their customer service is horrible ! ! i will never buy from them again ! !	12
1	excellent product very difficult to find in stores can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer healthier than heating in plastic	12
0	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
0	this is the worst nursing pad that i 've tried it slips out of place and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it i found myself with wet bras all the time ! these pads are terrible ! i recommend the lansinoh brand	12
1	i absolutely love this walker the songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained i also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere there are also great safety features such as the grip strips on the bottom the wheels are very easily manuevered also i would definitely recommend this product to other moms	12
1	the safety 1st cosco portable crib is great ! i purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits it 's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another i would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib it is very sturdy and also attractive	12
1	great sleepsack for our little bundle keeps her warm toasty i love the microfibre interior because it 's warm but not too hot also the exterior is wind resistant so it 's perfect for san francisco	12
1	i love these little books they play music good for before bed my girls can chew on them \( which makes both me and my two year old son happy \) just fantastic great buy	12
0	this idea is nice but the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap next the tray is hard to get off and wash next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray and that is really hard to get off by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash unless you are super woman i would not bu	12
1	baby is happy eating well what better praise for a bottle nipple can be given \? note fast flow is for age six months and up the slow medium flow nipples by avent are just as good \( just for younger babies	12
0	first the adhesive velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least second it is opaque so the kids could n't even take in their surroundings since it resembles a parachute the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the stupid thing would n't stay attached to the stroller the kids probably would n't have had fresh air go for hats and sunscreen protective garments instead	12
0	the idea behind these bags is great you can pump straight into the bag and store them the execution however is lousy using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying i prefer the lansinoh bags with the double seal even though you ca n't pump straight into them sealing them is quick and easy	12
0	do not order this item ! i ordered and returned this item four times due to cracked pieces storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage i refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture what a disaster and diappointment	12
1	i love this pump ! if you 're going to breastfeed you need this pump it 's expensive but worth the investment i pump at least 10 times a week and it 's just so much easier than the manual pump i tried	12
1	i bought this for my second son who is a year old i love it it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag after he eats i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well \( and saves my floors ! \) i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !	12
0	this was way too quiet even on it 's loudest setting my infant did n't benefit from it at all the sounds are fine and not too repetative as with some machines but even in a small room \( really small \) i found it too quiet to be effective	12
1	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old we feed our daughter with bottles \( mix formula with breast milk \) and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref \( my wife did breast bumping \) and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time also when we travel out this one is quite useful generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag \( well not compact bag though \)	12
1	i really like this i have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess i think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what my bottles fit just fine i use the avent bottles	12
0	this piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces the directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle ! but the actual parts are n't labeled so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean when finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable also as many of the holes are not lined up so i could n't even put in some of the bolts	12
0	i should have read the reviews i purchased this item and it quit working after a week of normal use	12
1	i bought 3 packages of dr brown 's \( through amazon com \) standard size nipples and i received 2 standard and 1 wide they shipped the wrong item to me i returned the wide to the address in calabasas california and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to right start i enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him since my purchase i still have not received anything except this email from amazon com i rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star	12
0	i got so excited when i saw this tummy time mat my enthusiasm was hedged when i read that the water pouch needed to be emptied daily if had known that little detail i would not have registered for this mat i must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together bummer honestly now i am skeptical of any tummy time mat i think my boys prefer a brightly colored patterned blanket toys within reach and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs better off spending the money elsewhere	12
1	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	12
1	i love this bottle drying rack it does n't take up a lot of space and looks and workds great	12
1	i was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles most of the potties i looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and i didn`t want anything like that this potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings just what the doctor prescribed	12
0	my 8 1 2 mo granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night i 've got the correct bumper pads etc but babies do move she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset i 've only had the crib 1 week she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer	12
1	i really like this it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature	12
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light if i were to do this over i would buy a different infant seat	12
0	i wish i had put storage bags on my registry instead they work okay as a multipurpose container but my freezer is full of these things moreover i got the 8 oz ones so they are only 1 2 full as my newborn only drinks 3 4 oz right now one of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately plus you need an adapter to fit the pump something i didnt know i needed and did n't get another waste of money from avent	12
0	i got this toy for my brother who is 4 the buttons were hard to press the stickers didnt stick it used many batteries and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal save ur money ! buy something else	12
1	if you have an ipod or mp3 player i 'd recommend getting this i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week and tested it out \( our baby has n't been born yet \) the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo and i'm 1 2 deaf i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color my only criticism is that it takes batteries \( no ac adapter \) we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly for 20 i think it 's great	12
0	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks its been 3 weeks when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks how hard is it to get replacements \? \? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college we purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it	12
1	i love the 5 point harness my daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt this seat was easy to install and we love it	12
1	my son is just so excited about his sponge bob bed he climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it i like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself	12
1	this monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night i test it frequently and it works there has never been a false alarm \( everyone warned me i would lose my mind if it went off by accident it has n't \) the only drawback the channel is not so clear there is static when you listen to it but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny \( i have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when i just want to monitor noise during the day but i would not have another monitor for his bedroom	12
0	i was really unhappy with this lock it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	12
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately was about to use my own then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall	12
0	after seeing the latest consumer reports article on infant car seats i immediately replaced my britax companion with a graco snugfit the britax had previously been highly rated but the latest test trashed it we were surprised becuase it is the first seat we have owned \( on our 3rd kid \) that really was rock solid snug once installed i bought a graco snugfit and i have nothing good to say about it no matter how tight i got the straps attached to the latch in my 2006 honda odyssey i could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort for now i'm sticking with the britax	12
0	sometimes it works ok sometimes it stops swinging for no reason sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music it always makes a gringing noise when swinging if it worked like it should it would be a great product i like the stars projected below when they work	12
0	with our knobs being on the front of the stove these covers hung down over the oven door and either got in the way or were popped off on a regular basis \( or pulled off by our 16 month old \) we found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop was n't in use	12
1	i bought this w the hippo travel high chair it worked great and kept things cleaner unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck	12
1	my sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect	12
1	absolutely love this product ! ! wish i had had one for my other 3 children we live in cold and windy north dakota and this is just so easy to use there have been times my little one has gotten too hot when i over bundle him in it i recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months	12
0	the warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up so much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping ! had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off	12
0	i was looking forward to getting this toy for my son but when i opened it up i was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag i thought the picture showed several more tools maybe my tool kit was not complete either way my son never really showed much interest in it	12
1	this crib came in five days and was in perfect shape we set it up in a reasonable amount of time i can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores	12
0	i thought these would be great specially for the but i was soo wrong ! ! i 've only washed them once to have everything clean b f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls ! ! the fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls way to many to even remove by hand and on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam ! ! ! it looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand me down after one wash ! ! do not waste your time or money ! !	12
1	hi this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble !	12
1	we 've used this seat when traveling and everyday use at home when our son was about 15 months old i put the highchair away and started using this it can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser ! ! it folds down so it can be put away easily if you 're having guests unlike a big highchair ! great chair !	12
1	we have the one with brown trim but i had to write a review here too because we just love this blanket it 's super soft the perfect size for swaddling and nice and light and still warm for baby we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son but does n't cause him to wake up sweaty it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it 's completely worth the money ! i 'd buy another in a second	12
0	this item is too small i kept putting it on the back windshield but it kept falling down each time i could not see my baby in this tiny mirror not worth the money at all	12
0	my 15 month old son pulled these off \( and broke one \) within about 5 minutes of installing them also he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas bad design do n't waste your money	12
1	i love this sack and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !	12
0	we had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart i chose this one because of its features and colors my daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it we tried for days to get her to use this but she never would so we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves	12
0	i do n't even know where to begin eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids \( 1 1 2 and 6 months old \) instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him she would cover her face and cry ! he would go off all by himself which was really creepy in the middle of the night and he broke after a couple of months now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house he 's defantly not worth the mone	12
0	i was so anxious to get this and when i finally did my daughter was just not that interested with it she barely plays with it i was hoping that with this she would spend more time on her tummy because she normally hates that maybe that 's why she did n't care much for this	12
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity yes activity at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving no moving no peek a boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby a good value at any price	12
1	we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing 66 ! the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install this evenflo gate was put together installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs have n't been able to budge it one inch plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls great product at a bargain price we 're ordering three more	12
1	i love this item with my first son and i got them again for my second son great product keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you do n't have to worry about loose blankets at night	12
0	i received this after much debate about the prior review had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer so i bought it and sure enough had the same problem amazon was great they sent me a replacement and still the same problem my baby is due any day so i am keeping the first one but sending back the replacement it doesnt come as described no blanket included and i dont see how you could adjust the wedge i am very disappointed with the product but happy about amazon 's willingness to assist in the issue	12
1	i loved having this easy swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart the velcro worked really well as it gave room to grow swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two she just totally outgrew this it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift	12
0	the ac adaptor and sound selections are great but the sound is way too low even on the highest level i foolishly bought this knowing that others thought it was too low but it really is so low you ca n't hear it 4 feet away turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me	12
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
0	i would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all ! this seemed like a good idea but my little guy was kicking and moving all over it barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath it also says that it is for 0 months on up but i definitely would n't use this if your baby ca n't sit	12
1	great product ! it makes your life a lot easier not having to worry about boiling your bottles please keep in mind that it is a sterilizer not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer somehow a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does	12
1	i am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath its getting him out that 's the problem with the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas personally i think these are some of the best tub toys ! my suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet you can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler it also makes a great place to color be careful to wash everything off before it dries	12
1	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12
0	this does not fold down 90 deg do n't buy if you think you 'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something	12
1	my daughter loves this toy ! all the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break too	12
1	i love the plug in feature there 's been many times i 've left the swing on \( have to rush to change a diaper and left it on \) true it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls the swing is n't incredibly fast but for my 2 month old it 's worked well there are two volume levels for the music but i 've only used the lowest setting	12
0	nine days from mn to pa seems too long perhaps target direct got process problems i am not satisified got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	12
1	i have no idea how our parents had us with out these ! they are the best invention ! my son likes to play with plates so i can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating i have a toddler and a 9 mo old neither of them have been able to remove these things and beleive me they 've tried so i dont know what that other review was talking about they 're inexpensive easy to use and clean	12
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit waste of money	12
0	waste of money does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this	12
0	i was very disappointed in the product the picture does not accurately represent the armoire the entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood not cherry wood at all the pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet in addition to the outside also pieces did come chipped cracked and one piece was also split into two ! ! ! i returned the item and wish i had n't ordered in the first place	12
0	i think the mobile is very cute but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly i tried attaching it in several differnt places i am going to return it	12
0	i really was disappointed with this product our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile	12
0	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out sort of but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips then when it comes time to change the film the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors my sister in law told me to register for it why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund	12
1	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system i feel like i am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way while using babyplus the battery cover clips snapped off i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts	12
0	we did read the directions and the product still works sporadically my wife is a physician ! the leaking problem is incredibly frustrating especially when the baby is crying buy anything else you will be very disappointed especially at this price point	12
0	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment although the monitor is sensitive and clear moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	12
1	we got two bundlemes for our twin infant sons the product handles wears and washes well this product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates the only problem we have come across on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute	12
1	i really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good the only thing i don acute t like is the way the strings work there are not enough and also they rip off easily not stitched well for the price generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed also suffication could be a problem we have bought a convertable crib \( common in europe \) which can be used till approx age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later anyhow we still love it it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari	12
0	i purchased this baby carrier for my 1 month old son when i put him in it he looked so uncomfortable i tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit but it still covered his face so i decided to shell out the for the infant support pillow expecting that to make a difference it did n't he still looked uncomfortable and squished only now i wasted more money my son is 21 1 2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz i ca n't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all a big disappointment if you 're looking for a carrier try the bjorn a million times better than this	12
0	this product is nice at first but you 'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you do n't have to put anymore holes in your home i 've bought 5 of them over 4 years we have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking do not buy buy something better and higher quality so that you wo n't have to replace in 6 months please listen to this review it will save you	12
1	this baby gate is ideal for the size and price i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate the hardware mount eye hooks are not the sturdiest but this gate definately gets the job done	12
0	these come in both boy and girl colors the picture shows pink purple and yellow bottles i received blue and green bottles i contacted amazon who promptly sent me another three sets \( all of the first three sets were wrong \) in the second shipment they only got one set right i e mailed to return these as well when i sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because they had already replaced the items be careful when ordering from this site	12
0	my son used this several times wet all over the floor each time there is no splash guard on it for boys but it probably works fine for girls	12
0	wow cheap plastic poorly routed holes took 1 2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction sent it back my daughter loved the dora picture and was very sad that she could n't keep it	12
1	every mother father should definitely purchase a baby monitor until this came i could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not the receiver side is battery operated so even if i walk around the house i can here my baby even the smallest sound is picked up ! amazing i have n't tried other monitors but this one is perfect and inexpensive so i would recommend it to anyone	12
1	we have 3 of them and have no complaints i keep one in my car one in my husbands and have another for travel it 's super easy to snap the carrier onto it and very easy to install in any car i just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars i could use the latch or just use the seatbelt for older cars i was worried that i would need my husband 's help with the installation but i was fine on my own just reading the directions i recommend this for everyone	12
1	if you are going to get a manual pump get this one i got a medela from the hospital and it was sooo slow and killed my hand but this one is way better it takes 5 10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the medela and it does n't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals and because you use it for less time total i have never used an electric pump so i ca n't compare it to one of those but as far as manuals go this one is awesome	12
1	i bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield i had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and i was n't able to get a drop out because the shields did n't stay in place if you have biggre breasts i would suggest using this pump	12
1	i do n't know what the reviewers before me were talking about i use this at kroger giant eagle and target and do n't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store it 's sturdy and easy to use do n't pass this one up	12
1	in terms of pre natal resources this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven i can not think of a reason not to buy this product every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting	12
0	i have to say that i just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail \( i ordered online because i'm so far from a babies r us location \) and i was excited at first the color is great and the cover fit perfectly but i have n't washed it yet actually i have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric the fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area \( middle of long side \) i plan to exchange this cover for another of the same i hope for better luck with the next one but man the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating	12
1	i heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges not a big deal i just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished	12
1	i had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before needless to say fabric does n't protect leather very well i ended up with deep depressions in the leather hopefully the leather will go back \( fingers crossed \) the firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up and both of the carseats are as secure as ever i have the rear and forward facing models	12
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	12
1	i did my research for the best stroller thus this one is the best in market travelling with my baby is much fun and easier i can carry fold and move it with no help its so easy to open and fold its very cozy my baby can sleep happily in it	12
0	this game is just the original a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at all ! ! i hate this game so much ! ! it is literally the worst dbz game i have ever played and i have played them all \) i advise you if ur looking for a new dbz game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system do not buy this game ever ! ! ! !	13
0	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
1	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
0	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
1	this title is the tre sequel to railroad tycoon if you loved the old 1990 's original you 'll enjoy this one as well only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited	13
1	i 've been playing mario games since the original debut on the nes and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game the rpg style is a great offshoot for the mario franchise the dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30 hours i spent playing the game were well worth it there 's a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find i will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over	13
1	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13

0	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
0	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
1	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
1	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
1	if you 're going to play karaoke revolution this is the mic for you i now have 2 so that my wife and i can play in duet mode it 's much better than the headset for just 17 bucks you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural if you play kr a lot invest in this microphone	13
1	you get to be different animals it is a really cool game i recommend it to other kids to buy the cheetah get shoot bow and arrows	13
1	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
1	i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics did n't annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba it 's kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpg 's like this it 's short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot ! it 's a lovely game	13
0	i dont have much to say other than i did not like this game i was hoping that it was going to be like fusion frenzy for the xbox but it was not nearly as fun the controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good some people may like it but i did n't	13
1	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
1	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13

0	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
1	time crises is a 5 star gam	13
1	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
0	i bought this adaptor because my kids and i have both the nintendo ds and ds lite it works great on the original ds but the thing that 's supposed to fit into the ds lite is too wide if you 're looking for an adaptor for just the regular ds this one works great if for the ds lite do n't waste your money	13
1	in terms of overall quality this game is light years better than tekken 4 the graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature i especially love the customization feature my only problem is playing against jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him other than that this game is terrific	13
1	ok i 've had this controller for 3 years and nothing happend to it it has fallen maney times and nothing happend some kid wrotethat it 's a rip off for 24 bucks ! ! well thats the best deal you 'll get it 's way better than the stupid bulky xbox controllers xbox may have better grathics but the games stink and xbox 's can catch on fire	13
1	quite simply it 's great though a bit on the challenging side gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it 's 'rated 'e' for everyone' approach will appeal to adults as well as kids it 's not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list if you like adventure titles like phoenix wright and trace memory \( or maniac mansion for that matter \) then you 'll really dig this game a good solid four stars	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
1	very good cable get it if you have a ps2 and a component input on your tv much better picture than composite cables	13
1	there 's a reason everyone loves this game there 's a lot of exciting action ! the popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it 's almost ridiculous driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game it 's a game you have to own if you 're a fan of video games	13
1	i ordered this game based on reviews alone it 's great ! will not disappoint the only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected other than that a great game hope to see a sequel	13
1	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
0	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
1	brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	13
0	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
0	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
1	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
0	first thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 caesar games out there having said that this game had a major bug right at the release how is that possible \? is it unreasonable to expect a u s company to produce a flawless product \? probably not but tilted mill has some of the the best pros in the industry basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess the advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer far better to go with civcity 3	13
1	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
1	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok	13
1	my daughter got the eye toy for her birthday and we recently added the dance groove game to the collection she and her friends \( 10 yrs of age \) really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids she says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera	13
1	i love this game ! it 's not too hard for kids to play \( my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets \) and it 's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it 's also cool so us adults can play as well ! i love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like jesse james and the jester etc the graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also	13
0	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	headset is awesome fits very snug on your ear and does not irritate over time has crystal clear 2 4ghz channel 9 hours of game time and only takes at the most 1 5 hours to charge gaming is a lot more fun !	13
0	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
1	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
1	if you are a ds owner this game is a must have you will not be disappointed	13
1	if you already have an eye toy and your favorite game on it is beat freak then you have to get eye toy groove the 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from elvis to good charlotte as a 46 year old woman i got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in this is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 even the preschoolers i occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than i can say for dance dance revolution	13
1	i got this game for my kids one is 11 and one is 9 they love it they can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it like baseball soccer boxing etc hey this even come with the camera i rated 4 stars because of the graffics they are not the best but still acceptible hope this review helps	13
0	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
1	in the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well but as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it	13
1	this is a well done game especially if you liked the movie characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there 's a cute storyline to the game there are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next there 's a pretty small age window that its good for i 'd say about 6 to 10 under 6 the stages are too hard over 10 they 're sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly it would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it 's still well done and worth buying	13
0	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
1	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
0	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
1	yes i am a die hard star wars fan and yes i love a good mission based action game so man if this is n't the perfect game for me ! it 's so much fun and there 's so much freedom in the game in itself ! add on to that the space missions and wow this game totally blows me away ! highly recommended for anyone who is a star wars fan a fps fan or a fan of fun gameplay	13
0	this is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection i 've ever experienced i bought this game new at a local store because i 've been itching to play simcity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed tried it with the other disc failed again went to the company 's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund	13
1	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
1	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
1	halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time this is definately a good game to play if you 've never played a first person shooter also if you have an xbox you should get this because it is awesome ratingsgraphics then 10 now 7sound 10replayability 6controls 10drawn in atmosphere 9fun 9multiplayer co op 9 multiplay	13
0	we have been unsuccessful with this e reader attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money	13
1	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
1	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
1	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
1	i love this game it is so much fun even though my wife does not like it i recommend this game for anyone who like mario kart games enjoy the races and do n't forget to blow your friends up	13
1	this is a pretty decent looking diablo style rpg game that adds another chapter to the game sacred in underworld you explore more areas farther north in the world of ancaria i found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore rather difficult and a little confusing but there are interesting new quests and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters the dwarf and demoness the original sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the underworld epansion pack	13
1	i have n't finished this game though i'm quite close to it i have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that i 've had in a long time i laughed out loud more than a few times was nearly constantly smiling and was thoroughly amused with all the little details not much stylus action but then again did you really expect there to be \? my boyfriend 's highly considering getting a ds lite simply so he can play this game	13
1	this game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities you can even go the wrong way for me \( older adult \) it was fun to play with my kids but i found it repetitive and boring after a while of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game	13
0	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
1	the godfather the game allows you to live the godfather movies the storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well the missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving ! but overall if your a fan of the godfather like i am you wont care \( respect the family !	13
0	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
1	this game was great ! it 's easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast in this one nancy is on a train that might be haunted lori girard \( your host \) invites a bunch of people including frank and joe hardy \( you actually get to play as frank in one part of the game \) then odd things start happening on the train lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train 's emergency brake is pulled this is a really fun game !	13
0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
0	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
0	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
1	the incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being the incredibles even though it is short pros amazing characters great graphics intresting plot footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artworkcons short only 1 playeroverallif you loved the incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well the same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy	13
1	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13

0	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
1	i got shrek 2 a couple christmases \( is that right \? \) ago and i gotta say it was alright the pros are that it is up to four players \( so if dad wants to spend quality time with junior \) it has a wide variety of fun characters and plenty of levels however it lacks graphics and young children might not do well during the game but overall its alrightgraphics c it must have been released early cuz it 's pretty badsound b crisp sounds the sound really matches the mood controls a changing and controlling characters' a breezegood for children and adults to	13
1	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
0	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13
1	this is a fun game to play i am on the 2nd mystery to solve i do love these types of games this one is sort of like trace memory alot of reading to do in it i am an adult woman my 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though	13
0	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
1	i bought this game a bit late \( 2 years after it came out \) but it still seemed state of the art to me ! loved the story and gameplay has improved significantlypros huge map with 5 massave areas to explore tons of vehicles you might not see the same one twice ! cool new features like vehicle customization endless stuff to do ! multiplayer modecons character customization prosess can be annoying if you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back \( ie all your muscle going down \) go buy this game you will really like i	13
1	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
1	neat game but i should n't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 the 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i'm the 'hero of kavatch' but i do n't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently does n't entitle me to even pick up an item if i do n't own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic	13
1	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
0	my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we 've enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles were n't really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there were n't many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead	13
1	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
1	this is perhaps the best of the final fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated ix had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay the characters are some of the most delightful in the series personally i think vivi and zidane are the coolest characters ever lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline on a sidenote this game definitely deserves a remake there 's a lot of hype about final fantasy vii its own prequel and a remake coming for ps3 i feel that final fantasy ix should be remade on the ps3 i love the story line better than vii the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible	13
0	as was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the final fantasy series its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man	13
0	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
1	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
0	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
1	this game is the best i have ever gotten i 've got in pin the tail on the ed but i ca n't seem to get pass the hard parts also this game deserves an oscar ! !	13
1	the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin	13
1	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
1	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
0	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
0	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
1	this product arrived quickly and in excellent shape thanks for being a quality shop this product is hard to find in a store thanks again	13
0	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
1	i bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that i havent been able to play it too often it was taken away from me hehehehehso my review is his and he sais that it deserves five star	13
1	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
1	another castlevania game means more excitement going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years i love the graphics they are truly something magnificent the special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a castlevania game should be this game follows the formula that was featured in symphony of the night which means if you like the metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well	13
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
0	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
1	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
1	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
1	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
1	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
0	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
1	i like the 05 version better sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it does n't appear to me ea sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter i was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe i was expecting too much i wo n't buy the 07 when it comes out i 'll wait and see what they can do with it on playstation 3	13
0	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	13
1	a lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good but it is my favorite game to play on the wii doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun and you get bonus points for ramming your opponents if it were only like that on real roads	13
0	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
1	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
0	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
0	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
1	this is the game for race lovers awesome graphics car responce is just like the real thing photo lab is very nice too \( you can take pics of your rides \) you will never get bored of this game a must have	13
1	you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub	13
0	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
0	i rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and could n't get past it do n't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	13
1	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
1	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
1	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
0	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
1	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13
1	i found this to be a fun game as well as effective i enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and abilty to increase my speed i particularly like it when it got to the level where i could choose which games i wanted to use for my brain age tests several of the games are going to require more repetitions before i become skillful at them i find that i continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest carole adan	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
1	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
1	this game is great for those that enjoy role playing games there is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story it was a lot of fu	13
1	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
1	king 's quest games are classic but why are they not including king 's quest 8 mask of eternity \? i know that it was not well received when it came out \( i personally liked it \) but just because it was not well received they wo n't include it it 's part of the series and should be included as well	13
1	this game is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle one time i was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game only three shots will kill you i had to restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it	13
1	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
1	i have been a staunch final fantasy fan for years while waiting for the newest release which kept being pushed back i tried out xenosaga let me tell you i am grateful i have ! this game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games i have ever played the world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique not to mention a plot that has profound depth you will fall in love trust me if you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours it is xenosaga	13
1	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
0	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
1	if i had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors i 'd choose the ds now i'm glad i have the option \( i e money \) to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where i could only take one system well you get the idea in a way the ds reminds me of the ps2 it 's a bargain it 's backwards compatible so it plays gba game the games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 you ca n't go wrong	13
0	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
1	i just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars i had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox \( i 've been a ps2 fan for a while \) after i played the first couple of levels i was not dissapointed this game is simply amazing even today i ca n't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out the gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics the sound and music to the game is awsome i highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning	13
1	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
1	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
0	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
1	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
1	i bought this memory for my kids since hey were advancing in video playing and were n't able to save their achievements this memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels i think is the best out there	13
1	pros exciting and absorbing story line great gaming experience cons some minor bugs single player game cannot replay more than a few times	13
0	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
0	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
1	all the family have played this game and have had a blast sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids the graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun we also own the movie	13
1	nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price	13
1	i bought this game a couple months ago and i absolutely love it ! i am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will love ths ! it 's great excerise and very challenging with cool music it 's like ddr only with your hands try it i promise you 'll have a great time i could play it all day	13
0	i saw a dvd player at target for 30 yesterday i especially do n't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it 's 40 ! ! space saving maybe \? \? \?	13
0	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
0	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
1	i love this thing it 's awesome the older version of ds was a little clunky and childish looking this thing rocks my socks off ! it 's sleek sexy and portable it 's like an ipod of video games you do n't have to buy batteries it comes with an extra stylus its screen is brighter the sound is stereo ! this thing is super dope ! it 's the freshest thing out there ! you gotta get one sell your old ds on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one you 'll love it	13
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
1	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
0	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
1	i have always loved mario and when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite i bought this with it this game is absolutely amazingly fun ! the graphics sound and the game itself are incredible this game is good for any adult or child although for a younger child it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating \) with this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again and possibly again after that but every time you try again you understand something new about the level and it really is fun there also are the features of becoming mega mario and mini mario which mixes things up every once and a while this game is wonderful definitely a great buy	13
0	the copy of simcity4 that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press 2 now ea 's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes ! i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code ! i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product	13
0	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
1	when i upgraded to the 360 i was a bit saddened that i would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing first wireless no tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also \( although i'm sure they 're on the wired controllers \) quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch	13
1	i would be 5 on this one all the way because i enjoyed the game immensly \( the general idea of the game \) but because of personal preference i stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art if you like this game but do n't want all the questionable material \( yes i know that it 's nothing compared to other games \) then may i recommend fate by wildtangen	13
1	this game is a lot of fun the level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music is n't as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days	13
1	i 've never played real time strategy games before because i primarily play rpg 's this game combines the best elements of both and i 've enjoyed playing it immensly i look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters	13
0	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
0	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	13
0	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
1	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
1	hello all uhh there 's not really much to this card but yeah it keeps you online for another year which is good its 50 bucks for the year long which is very cheap so yeah go out and buy this if your online ps online people add me my 'tag is smiling bob117	13
1	expensive but worth it it just works no more wires	13
1	this is a great memory card for people with only a few gcn games but those who have a bigger collection will either need to buy two or the gcn memory card 1019	13
1	i bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact i have n't heard any noise he is to busy playing it	13
1	this controller feels great in your hands in fact after using this controller for awhile my batteries went low and i had to switch back to the dualshock controller the dualshock felt wierd in my hands the response of the controller is good i have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time one down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time i guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year	13
1	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
1	this game is great for when you have a group of friends come over it really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining i suggest this game for everybody	13
0	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
1	this is an unorthodox football game this is not an nfl game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league there are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom beat the division 3 level move up to 2 beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game as you move up you also unlock rewards if you 're tired of madden 's franchise mode give this game a try it wo n't get outdated just because of nfl free agency	13
0	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
1	no other game looks or plays like this the missions and locations are varied and colorful the villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials and as usual rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating lots of unlockables offer high replay this is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period i still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru the story is straightforward and engaging lots of really interesting concepts \( machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole 'dead eye' thing \) and it controls very well another great game from an outstanding company hopefully a sequel is in the works	13
1	5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves a must buy for anyone looking for a non stop action game	13
0	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
1	i could care less what it does for the original xbox what i'm into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer xbox save files over to xbox 360 now i wo n't have to start halo all over	13
0	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
1	in the april 2005 pc gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time half life was 1 this is basically a sequel to that game very fun except when you 're in a server with hackers in it just make sure to never give your cd key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it \( for version 1 6 \) then go to browse games and register your cd key once you do that you wo n't be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years	13
1	i very much enjoyed this game and i think it may be my favorite x box game i own ! i kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better ! one funny part about this game is the part where you are sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable	13
1	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
1	my 9 year old and 16 year old fight over this game my 9 year old owns the game she has asked me to buy her 16 year old sister the game so she will leave hers alone it is a great game that will hold your attention	13
0	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
1	these wipes are great i have three children and have used the pampers huggies and house brand wipes the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done house brand do n't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough the pampers are thin soft and moist enough to get the job done because they are thin they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded refolded for 100 useage \( unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver \) definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said if you want something moister go get a paper towel and wet it with water	14
0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially but also in your neck and feet your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane	14
0	i purchased this prior to surgery thinking it would be great for recovery however the nature sounds only worked the first time i turned it on after that despite changing batteries etc the sounds never came back again i would n't recommend this purchase	14
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we 're yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it 's been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor	14
1	nice mirror good magnification solid construction my only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall i had to move a picture to position it at the correct height	14
1	i was skeptical of this product especially at the price however i am so pleased with its effectiveness i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years and i'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red angry looking spot this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager	14
0	i saw a commercial i read a reviews and so i bough one box at walmart it 's not worth it that 's my conclusion the trays are made of very thin plastic like material and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth the active gel easy goes out of trays and fills your mouth during first couple od uses after 20 min or so i started to feel a vague pain in my gum nevertheless i continued using the product for all 7 days as advertised 30 min a day after the whole package was gone the change of color of my teeth is barely visible i hope you will have better luck	14
0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine i purchased this scale on the unit i received the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale when i attempt to use this scale it errors out with the ol code perhaps the magazine should retract another article	14
0	the flexible arm is not stiff enough to support the dry weight of the showerhead this is the most pathetic product that i have seen in decades	14
1	i 've owned this item for about a year and it works great comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and never had a problem with it deflating i recommend this item	14
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal do not buy this product	14
0	it lasted one year and two weeks then the motor died while it worked it was great i am tempted to buy a replacement but will probably end up trying another brand the manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several because when they do work they do a great job	14
0	i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful and it was at a great price but looks can be decieving ! ! this straightener pulls my hair it does n't get very hot it 's kind of uncomfortable to hold and it doesn't straighten my hair ! ! !	14
0	within two weeks the hose connection was leaking the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the	14
1	i 've only used the kit once and it did what it was supposed to no problems everything went fine and i intend to use it again within about a month it should pay for itself very quickly	14
0	this was a terrible product i got little sores everywhere i used it believe me i will only use it once wish i had my money back	14
1	this razor is fantastic the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream gel would but if you are looking for a quick handy and yet still good shave this is exactly what you are looking for	14
0	returned item as was leaking all over great product if amazon had packed it better i could have used it	14
1	in the past i bought hair dryers at target because of the prices i had no idea that a few more bucks can buy you a quality hair dryer that surpasses any conair sassoon etc purchased at this and similar stores the difference in the quality is noticed immediately upon use although the bb pro is a little heavier than i'm used to it dries hair faster and with fewer frizzes it 's amazing	14
1	this product works well it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going	14
1	i 've been using 2 of these batteries in my walkman for 10 hours now and they are still going very strong it 's living up to its reputation as described so far	14
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c a completely pathetic rip off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond	14
0	i'm very sorry but the universal remote control was not what i expected like when i want to turn on my tv the vcr came on and visa versa but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money very pleased about the service thanks regards yoka van dijk	14
0	i would have given it zero stars but that is not an option it stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception it was difficult to get a station and it was not a problem with the batteries run do n't walk away from this	14
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued \( like i could hardly move \) i had been taking a general multi vitamin from a local warehouse store i started taking the nature 's plus source of life and i felt so much better my energy level has increased dramatically and i just feel good great quality product	14
1	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results the size of the cuff is very important so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results this is true in the doctors office also my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office on his machine just by changing the size of the cuff this is an excellent monitor i could n't be happier with it it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too	14
1	my youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis i bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust mold pollen ect she has been using this product for three \( 3 \) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time we have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product highly recommeded	14
0	first know this it is a trimmer not a shaver ! with the included height attachment your bound to have a little fuzz still left without the attachment you get closer results but still very visible hair lines i am quite disapointed with the product because it runs on two aaa batteries the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you i would certainly not recommend this product but might be necessary if you 'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild	14
0	the very first thing i noticed was how small and crammed the case was it was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something the other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was the bonnnet was difficult to get on mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place and kept pulling the bonnet off my head after a couple of trys and reading the instructions i knew i would never use it simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head whoever designed this product should be demoted	14
1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
0	i purchased these but had to return them while the molded strap is adjustable it only opens up approx 1 the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23 5 or larger around at the eyebrows forget it these will not fit you	14
0	sorry sleepmd we are not impressed not only did sleepmd not work for me but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too today we feel worse for the wear and a bit ripped off no i did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed more like we were run over during the night i wanted to inquire to the company in person but ca n't find a website to do so so i plan to write i would n't recommend this product to anyone it 's a waste of money	14
0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
1	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer i would recommend this hair dyer	14
0	i purchased this product for my husband for christmas he has been in two car accidents and has migraines we thought this might help it does n't he feels very uncomfortable in fact my mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either in fact if you are short as my mother and myself are it does n't do anything for you	14
1	the shampoo does n't lather but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day and it seems to be doing it 's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch free since i started using it so i would recommend it	14
1	i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep	14
0	if you think you are buying the old met rx bars by the same flavors you are in for a very very bad surprise the old bars had better taste and a almost cake like consistency these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one also i could n't get past the taste even the color is different i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day \( years ago \) i gave the entire box away for free i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe	14
1	i have several of these glasses now love them they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one good price and good product	14
1	i use and like most all of the olay lines of products this one is great because it is not only a sunscreen but a skin treatment as well i ca n't wait for the one that has a hint of tan in it along with the sunscreen to be on the market i heard about it but apparently it is not out as of yet	14
1	these are by far the best newborn size diapers especially for small babies but if you order them through amazon your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive ! i waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1 which actually arrived in a few days ! update i have ordered pampers again through amazon \( different size \) and they shipped right away	14
0	the little radio does not have the ability for station lock in every time it is turned on it reverts to a station set at the manufacturer since there are no indicators or displays it is annoying and time consuming having to constantly reset the station \( s \) it also has lousy reception and lots of static can be heard when the radio is on	14
1	i did n't think i would like the fragrance but it 's absolutely wonderful it 's not too sweet or strong it smells good on my daughters and me give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
0	wo n't even cut hairs you stick directly into the blade the shape and slots of the housing covering the blade would only cut hair that was as dense as a forest and then only if you shoved it in hard	14
1	i really like this product it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped the neutrogena has helped 100 when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !	14
1	i 've used the pigeon brand \( i believe it 's from japan \) milk storage bags those are the best quality bags i 've ever used unfortunately they 're also very difficult to find these lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1 3 of pigeon 's price not bad at all ! my baby and i travel a lot so i bring along my stock of bmilk in these lansinoh bags no mishaps thus far highly recommended	14
0	this epilator by emjoi does not work without the cord attached the motor is too weak in addition the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends the middle disks since they are inset from the top never reach the hair i had to return this item and i would not trust or recommend any item by emjoi extremely poor quality and does not work as promised	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
1	i agree with the previous reviewer i have used this brush for years ! it was recommended to me by a hairdresser and i will never use a different brush unless you have fine thin hair you will love this brush ! ! !	14
1	it is really good enough for my need i have no problems so far	14
0	it took my 3 1 2 year old 10 seconds to defeat this it took me about 30 minutes to install it pretty ineffective as far as i'm concerned your mileage may vary	14
0	i purchased these as a christmas gift for my daughter they take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair for the money i do n't think they were worth it	14

1	just bought this showerhead i have a stand up shower built in with a pull around curtain all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor this is the one it works great i have a shallow well pump with 40 60lbs of water pressure setting my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub	14
1	great compact design takes up very little room in your suitcase rollers heat up are ready to use in about 2 3 minutes like the product claims sets hair better then most rollers \( and i have tried many \) the only thing that i would change is to add 2 4 more rollers but i liked these rollers so much i actually bought a 2nd set use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !	14
0	like the fading in of light would like the sound effects if they worked ! out of box the sound effects did not work now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace such a hassle	14

1	saw this product or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns australia it was selling for about 70 australia dollars which is still quite expensive converted to us i came back to u s and found it on amazon for 15 99 with free ship if i purchased 30 so i bought two one for myself one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks less the neckchains which always used to get tangled it 's an ingenius invention	14
0	my rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set regardless of me using more or less hair maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio if so it is impossible to find i dunno but i do know i would not recommend these also even when i get these to stay in my hair my hair does n't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers overall buy something else	14
0	i'm a fan of the line i love the chocolate but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting vanilla should be subtle this was more like taking a shot of extract	14
1	a very gentle undereye cream i have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time this one is definitely a keeper	14
0	i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it	14
1	i have been using kiss my face olive oil soap for years and i wo n't let any other soap touch my face ! i found it when i was searching for a soap that would n't make my skin itch all over after a shower i can tell you that after years and years my sensitive skin has never once itched after i used kmf ! the soap is mild with a neutral scent which is a big plus it cleans great but does n't leave my skin dried out the 8 ounce bars are a bit large but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that 's easier for us smaller hands people	14
0	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it i sent a review to the company with no response the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied	14
1	i got this showerhead for christmas and am really happy with it ! ! it 's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you i do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place but with mine anyways it stays in place while i'm using it and it 's only later that it slowly lowers down then i just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when i want to use it it has n't been any trouble so far i love this showerhead so much that i'm actually already looking for an even larger one ! ! i highly recommend these rainfall showerheads !	14
0	i recently bought his blow dryer and to my surprise when i use it it sends out huge sparks and smoke towards my head pretty dangerous in my opinion i do n't reccomend it	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
0	its super cheap does not work at all will struggle with the thinnest of hairs stay away ! !	14
0	this is the best diet product ever ! i tried them all and skinny water \? is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever the product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much i drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away i lost 15 lbs in 20 days great taste it works great and it 's so inexpensive great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight the owners should hire me to do commercials for them	14
0	i agree with the other reviews it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water it is only supposed to maintain the temperature but after using it for about 20 minutes it did n't even do that the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth back to the store indeed	14
1	i really like this sanitizer the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish that it was bigger so i could fit bottles and things slightly larger in it but i do put her pacifiers and bottle nipples in there	14
1	this was sent to my daughter and son in law as a thank you present for a recent visit i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap shampoo etc my son in law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well	14
0	i like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper so i bought tushies when my baby was newborn they seemed to work ok maybe because she did n't put out that much she is now three months old i practice attachment parenting so i know exactly when she has a bowel movement the past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly she was sitting on my lap she had a bowel movement five seconds later i got up to change her the feces was all over my pants this has happened several times the concept of the diaper is great but the diaper needs some work around the legs	14
0	i got this curler set and i completely regret it ! i used it once and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy and there was a bump from where the clamps were it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down i would n't even give it one star take my advice do not buy this !	14
1	i started taking anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work i am not usually a stressed out sort of person however i recently got transfered to nyc and i'm from utah just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out i am working as a trader and it is very high energy anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here	14
0	i wish i 'd listened to the other reviews i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me claims a five year warranty but i ca n't return it to amazon so it 's just money wasted be smarter than me avoid this product if you value your money	14
0	fall asleep inminutes what a joke don`t waste your money on this product	14
0	i was very disappointed with this product not only did it come in a foreign \( chinese \) box it does n't work well at all the powder that was included actually made it worse if i were you i would keep searching	14
0	while one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool the manufacture has indeed done so the spoon portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil i supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility but instead of using a fastener or weld its just rolled metal inserted into the coil after only two uses the spoon came out of the coil and even though i could easily enough put it back together after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now would recommend buying a more simply designed single piece shoe horn	14
1	this is a great product i use it on my eyeglasses as well as my computer screen tv screen recommend it to al	14
1	daughter was very pleased when she received it unexpectedly after her good news ! she 's very picky also just loved the quality and organizational value of the set ! very nicely packaged would highly recommend	14
0	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks \( as advertised \) i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store \( like i had to eventually do when i ran out \)	14
1	tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market thank you amazon for carrying it	14
1	the product was a gift for my mother who needs extra circulation in her feet she loves it and it has helped increase the circulation	14
0	the razor is n't bad but the cleaning system is a joke mine would n't release the razor kept recleaning it plus and i am surprised that this is n't mentioned in the other reviews that i read before getting the razor the cleaning solution \( which is an expensive printer ink type of gimmick \) stinks like metal solvent bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price	14
0	until i bought several weeks worth of rayovac alkaline d cells i used duracell alkaline d cells every week i run a 3 cd changer \( jvc cx xc370 \) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes at the same volume level \( volume 10 \) from tuesday to thursday the duracells lasted all 11 hours \( and might last even longer \) in contrast these rayovac d cells for the last three weeks \( maybe four weeks \) have consistently died during the second half of the next to last class \( after hour 9 5 and before hour 10 \)	14
0	i ordered this and while i'm a fan of other therabeads products i found this poorly designed unless you have a very thick neck the velcro straps are worse than useless they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck and then it did n't cover the neck well	14
1	i purchased the revlon facial steamer this was my first purchase on line and i am very satisfied with the steamer and the service i received from amazon the steamer is great i use it when i give myself a facial i have not use the nail kit yet	14
1	recommend it suppressed my appetite the first day when i got hungry it took a few bytes to feel full again	14
1	this has helped me more than i can say it has helped with a death of a very close relative without this i would n't be able to lead a normal day at my high level stress job	14
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she is able to do her nail easily the nail attachments work really well and strong the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone compact size easy to store and quick charge time	14
0	all this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing i looked at it for a long time i never found a clear explanation of what it actually is so i tried it and it seems like it should cost about 11 99 save your money	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	the first one i purchased lasted about 2 weeks then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working exchanged it for another one it lasted about 3 weeks then the same thing have now purchased a different brand would not recommend this product	14
0	one i started using the shaver it fell apart it has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just do n't work the shaver is a waste of money	14
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom \( same brand and model \) is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall	14
1	these wipes are awesome ! they got here real fast too !	14
1	after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed but it 's been over 2 months and so far so good i sleep on it every night \( i'm buying a real bed when i move in june \) and it is holding up	14
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv dvd set too bad i liked the large numbers and light	14
0	this product does not do what it advertises does not work at all on my facial hai	14
0	i recieved these dead they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged it 's not my charger waste of mone	14
1	this shaver is the best shaver i have ever used it gives me the closest shave it is very comfortable to hold it is great my brother in law liked it so much he bought one	14
1	mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well i like the way this cream gives instant glow	14
0	this is a very cheaply built product we had a hard time getting it to mist at all even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at when it did mist it would not get more than about 1 3 inch from the top so the mist never made it out of the bowl we did like the changing color lights	14
0	i bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer but its not good first of all it does n't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible \( i have done wax and wax does n't hurt compare to this \) then this is your product other bad thing it produces ingrown hair the horror !	14
1	these are very tasty they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you they also are great in a diaper bag purse center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination	14
0	i bought this product from the discovery channel store and i really want to love it but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after i bought it i returned to the store where i was given a new fountain but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later the mister still works well but the led lights are unpredictable at best	14
0	well i have used philips ladyshave before and i regret for making my mind to try this one it hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars	14
0	i was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave i was looking for it also was taking me much longer to shave because i had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs in the end after using it for 5 weeks i took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver i am back to my razor blade i still hate shaving	14
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest however i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help but nothing seemed to work the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist so it did n't leak out or touch my gums my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards but later in the day if you have sensitive teeth i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain	14
1	i have owned many beard trimmers but this is by far the best	14
1	this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eye sore even in small rooms also stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours which i guess it 's good that it 's easy to refil the price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price perhaps you pay for the convient size overall i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size	14
1	if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper then this is the brand and variant you should switch to if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises \( rapidly dissolves \) i 'd have to give it five stars it practically melts as soon as it touches water do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue i'm giving it only four stars because it 's not my favorite toilet paper \( that would be charmin ultra \) but the necessary choice	14
1	it works very well i bought it for my wives calves she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick using this product her calves become soft and getting thin i 've used it too i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation	14
0	i bought these clippers for cutting hair at home even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair the charge does n't last through one haircut the trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut and they do n't trim evenly i finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb i would n't recommend this product to anyone i was extremely disappointed in it	14
1	my mother is 87 and the shower chair makes it easier she likes it in the tub better and i just use warm water poured over her	14
1	i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box the best part naturally is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages i feel refreshed everytime i used it it took awhile to get the drainage to stop but i am glad i purchased this system it works	14
0	i bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working ans i do agree the smaller the hair straightener the better \( i originally had a smaller one that my salon uses but it also stopped working \) the light is on and the heat comes off and on randomly very upsetting	14
0	item does not look any thing like the picture it is flat i do n't feel any difference when i am setting for long periods of time	14
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots my friend owns one and at first i was envious but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
1	finally a product that does as it promises excellent sun burn protection even in hawaii	14
0	this hair dryer was purchased as a christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years i could not locate one locally so i order from amazon the dryer only worked for a few days nothing i do will make it work again the reason i have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much	14
1	this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had my kids love them too great high energy snack	14
1	very nice scale worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh	14
0	it was an awkward mess smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered much less fit securely it 'd probably be easier without the trays i do n't know if they work or not i gave up i want my crest whitestrips back	14
0	this device works ok jet stream is moderate noise is considerable has a lot of attachments that really do n't do much i'm not sure what the brushes even do the dual tank function is pretty good but lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part	14
0	i agree with the reviews from the other reviewers it basically ruined my nails the first time i used it however what i did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed after trimming their claws you often get rough edges i now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short they do n't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet i must state that i will never again use this product for my own nails	14
1	the dispenser looks good holds a decent volume of shampoo conditioner etc it is simple to refill the bottles and so far there is no leakage the mounting was easy glued onto the tiles with silicone glue \( included \) if it broke or we decided to replace it we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles the top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads overall satisfied good product for the price	14
1	i am a big fan of 2 curling irons but they can be difficult to find my last one \( different brand \) wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now i have shoulder length hair fairly thick plus wavy and frizzy 2 curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair while also turning it under \( or up if desired \) at the ends for a nice finished look i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat straight iron while achieving superior results you will not get curl with this curling iron you will get smooth hair quickly and easily highly recommended	14
0	this device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity one must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding at best this device might manage to acurately read a pulse after a strenuous activity is concluded	14
1	as a reviewer of the hitachi magic wand i can say that this accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the job the plus is that this can be used with or without the power cord perhaps just not as powerfull as the hatachi but pretty dam comparable if not the same the cordless battery operation is worth the trade off as mentioned it does the job	14
0	i bought it new after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower it stopped working i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior including the electronics they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower i have not opened the shaver i have not cleaned it in water thus based on my experience this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	14
0	i had an old caruso molecular setter that finally conked out i thought the ion feature of this would be great the clicking is annoying but if it worked i would n't mind this puts out way less steam causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system then after all that it only curls about 1 2 as much so it takes longer for less curl not worth it i hope i can get another caruso but i hear they have problems now too ahhhh remember the good old days when things worked	14
1	since having back problems especially waking up in the morning this lumbar extender works wonders for my back i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks b	14
1	love this product have been using oil of olay before it was heard of by most this is more advanced and makes my skin look and feel more youthful	14
0	please careful about this grooming kit i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair also this can not be used for continuous use if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	14
0	would work great except this does n't fit my new waterpik ultra \( wp 100 \)	14
0	there is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth this defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth very disappointing	14
0	i did n't want to spend a lot of money on an ionic hair dryer i came across this one and thought i 'd give it a try the light indicating the ionic generator is working stopped working after its first use what a waste of money !	14
0	when i got this pedometer i found that the instructions were n't clear i never did get the thing to work i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate this one was n't the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost it 's just easier to buy a new one however i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store	14
0	the scale part works fine but the fat measurement does not work if you care about fat i 'd recommend using the hand held device instead it gives more accurate reads	14
0	we already owned a different homedics sound machine and it 's far better than this one the volume control does n't work well at all on this machine either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static no matter where we used the machine the product seemed very flimsy as well we ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine	14
0	amazon and this company are nightmares i ordered this scale a month ago and the expected ship date keeps changing i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever he was no help at all after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade all he was able to give me was the ship date range which has already changed several times amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time	14
1	now my husband ca n't borrow my gasses and i never loose them i have one of each color and get rave comments every time i take them off in front of strangers	14
1	i think it nice for me make my eyes relax after long time working before computer	14
0	i had a wahl clipper pair before it was a good pair of clippers the pair i owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad that was the pair i wanted again the pair i have now does not perform like the previous pair so i'm stuck with the pair ihav	14
0	i figured for the price how could you go wrong \? well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether no hot air no cold air nothing ! ! this item looks like a great deal but save your and buy something that will last you longer than 2 1 2 months the manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product !	14
0	i have not recieved the vitamins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lost in the mail \? \? \? \? \? \? please let me know what i can do it has been a month	14
0	the foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my remington gets fairly easily overrated and overpriced eurotrash	14
0	this brush is worth about 10 bucks anything more and you are throwing money down the drain	14
1	i'm not sure how well since i have never used anything like this before but my bath water feel a whole lot better and i do not itch for an hour afterwards i probably should have rated a 5 star but i really have no base for comparing i will definitely buy this product again	14
1	i bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product she personally like the product and really good	14
1	i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectivelythank you so muchbimvik	14
1	this water jet is excellent it allows you to have a separate chamber for water and mouthwash it also comes with different attachments for your gums teeth and tongue excellent product at an excellent price	14
1	the monitor is relatively cheap easy to use and mostly accurate the one gripe i have is that if i take my pulse 3 times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to 40 points ! usually this is not a problem i tend to check it 3 times and average the 3 which is sufficient for my purposes	14
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products this conditioner \( and i might add shampoo by the same name \) was a real disappointment using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one i'm saving my for lush and frederic fekkai	14
1	i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling	14
1	i purchased this dryer for my wife it took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting my wife 's hair is thick and long so she did n't want get anything below 2000 watts this one is light powerfull and handy i strongly recommend it	14
0	the first one of these i received broke after 2 uses target com quickly sent a replacement at no charge and now that one has broken after about 5 uses very frustrating because otherwise it seems like a good system	14
0	after doing extensive research on the web i purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor while the easy fit cuff was easy to place the b p readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous b p cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor 's office since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings i returned the b p cuff to amazon for a refund	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14
1	i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using he has been enjoying the features offered by this device he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints it was a great price for a quality product	14
1	this is a wonderful product it smells great as well as works great i was worried that it would be too drying on my skin but it was n't it seemed to balance between where it was needed and where it was n't	14
1	panasonic makes a great electric shaver this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years	14
1	my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the stree	14
0	i ordered one and had it arrive totally broken amazon sent a replacement that too was defective save your time money and buy another maybe in person i'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping \( amazon is giving me a refund including shipping so there 's not a problem there	14
0	enough single use garbage diapers are used in the u s each year to reach to the moon and back think about where they come from and where they go what kind of world do you want your kids to live in \? cloth diapers are not difficult and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies they have no where near the negative environmental impact	14
0	all sleep md is is melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in you can get melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid but you do n't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it ! sleep md is a total rip off	14
0	i order it on july 14th but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it	14
0	i have not tried the product yet as it is a stocking stuffer for my four year old the ad displays four soaps when in fact you only receive one i would not have purchased one bar of soap had i have known	14
1	these bars are absolutely fantastic they are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein \( 20g \) they taste pretty good far better than most bars i prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream next being the peanut butter and then chocolate a chocolate mint flavor has just been released but i have yet to try it i recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out	14
1	i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far even though this is my first electric shaver it is a good deal for the money it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close i would recommend it or give it as a gift	14
0	a big disappointment after filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the warmer as advertized it was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place i returned it for a refund	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
1	this is a useful tool in that it makes the software hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack	14
0	unlike several other reviewers i loved this trimmer for 5 months at that time the rechargeable battery just died completely would not recharge at all and the remington people are useless when filing a complain	14
1	if i could give this product over five stars i would ! i get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when i finally got this product in one of the starter kits burt 's bees makes and i was hooked i use this with their marshmallow vanishing cream and my skin feels and looks great i have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles i always have when i use the royal jelly cream though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems	14
1	these little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums flossing with traditional floss hurt because i always cut myself and deeply it probably saved me from serious gum disease and that i understand is expensive to treat so i 'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy	14
1	i appreciate the gentle yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together	14
0	the foil is a bit misleading because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves \( under the zipper \) the timmer will catch you and it hurts a lot the foil can only be used on straight surfaces the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer well be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa	14
1	also bought as a gift but i tried it ! very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in the mall	14
0	this is not one of the best hair dryers i 've had at best it 's average the nozzle is too long and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal i like attachments that can rotate so that i can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair the ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair after using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths \( about 3x a week \) the switch for heat settings is now loose the dryer only blows cool air even though i slide the switch for higher temperatures my rating has gone from average to below average	14
1	i have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help i bought big one for home and personal for work it 's been 2 days and it 's working fine	14
1	bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there no hair on him or pillows or sheets this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair i also used it on the tougher part of his beard wonderful item	14
1	i bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money it really is ! after using this the recomended 15 minuets my feet felt just like they did when i had a professional foot massage ! i highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged	14
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids kids will be kids but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push easy to mount and easy to use	14
0	this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it first of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry if anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work i wish i had spent more and got the sedu since it had very good reviews now i have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened now tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used duh	14
1	i bought this model 7 years ago for over 100 and it is still running strong although i only use it to clip a small family dog nevertheless forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal this clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action in fact with the right \( replaceable \) blade you could use this to cut kids hair as well it stays cool unlike the magnetic motor design use with oster kool lube and you will never have problems getting a clean cut it uses blades by oster so there is a lot of versatility possible	14

1	great tasting bar nice and soft make it easy to eat	14
0	i bought one and it worked great at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot but once you get used to it it does a stellar job of straightening your hair around 6 months into using the straightner the machine slowly overheated and died thinking i had a faulty model i went out and bought a new one guess what \? a few months into that one it ended the same way so basically not worth it	14
0	i had such high hopes for this hair dryer well known brand diffuser with long fingers just like i prefer etc well the first time i used it my hair looked like i had been through a wind tunnel ! the low setting is like most other hair dryers' high settings even with the diffuser on it really blasts the air out ! i have wavy lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess this dryer may be fine for people with straight hair but i definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair	14
1	it 's pretty good do n't see it making anything firmer but it works nicely as a moisturizer i checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing about it ruining their life all over the net probably an allergic reaction you always have to test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your eyes	14
1	best hair dryer ever i have long thick curly frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x my hair is shiny and soft the diffuser is also amazing i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz by far the best dryer out there in this price range granted it 's heavy but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones \?	14
0	took two pump bottles on a camping trip in the sierras and they leaked terrible ! fortunately i had double bagged them in ziplock bags i was able to spread the leakage on my body by hand which did keep the mosquitos off for hours	14
0	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips wrong answer i was able to play 2 1 2 cds before my box was out of juice game over i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left i figured they 'd at least last into the night but they were finished before sundown do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices i got fooled fool me once shame on you we ca n't get fooled again	14
0	though not advertised to humidify a large room i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room i tested it in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room and after 2 hours not even a 1 increase in humidity ! fortunately i was able to receive a full refund	14
1	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads different sizes for many years and i'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating i would n't be without mine it helps me manage my arthritis fibromylagia nerve damage pain i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well	14
0	i like to use the wet wipes they 're good products i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well i received the package this week all seals of three boxes were broken lids fell off and the wipes were everywhere in the package they were dried up but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet and it almost fell apart what a mess it was !	14
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks with nimh rechargable batteries installed and it performs as advertised there is in my opinion a design flaw the start stop button acts as the power on off function and is easily depressed at unwanted times e g putting into or removing from the case they could should have included an ac adapter	14
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact useful size however the rollers take a long time to heat up even if left plugged in for a half hour they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair i would not recommend this product	14
1	this is the best shaver i have ever owned and i wish it was still available	14
1	i used aveeno moisturizer and thought i would try something new i have eczema on my face \( around my eyes nose and mouth \) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days my skin is very sensitive and have experienced burning with other products but not this one i sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy yet strong enough to tackle dry skin i highly recommend it	14
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers i learned about the revlon tourmaline all of the reviews were so positive i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are the placement could n't be better on the controls the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive a very good value	14
0	we received it with broken cover it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour we tried different ways to make it run but nothing worked we 've returned it it 's just waste of money on the other hand the cow humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well no complaints	14
1	i love the idea of the glasses always being where i can find them the only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide the band is every time i look up the magnets pop apart if they fix that i 'd give them 5 stars ! !	14
1	this product does wonders it helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week like another customer i have sensitive skin i did n't feel this dried my skin out at all but a word to the wise make sure to read the directions carefully this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints if used properly its fantastic	14
0	i bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair it takes off most of it but i dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2 3 days much like shaving it off i would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day moreover on underarms it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one dont waste your money on this one	14
0	these did nothing for me ask your doctor about aphthasol a prescription drug approved by the fda which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards aphthasol changed my life	14
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these mine arrived with one case broken open although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag	14
0	tried this product for 2 weeks it did improve the clarity and softness but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well seemed to have a sticky feel since then i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare this product performs like magic it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush i can do the treatment 2 3x 's a week \( like your supposed to \) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before it is a magical product bette hampton chicago i	14
1	lightweight easy to transport easy to put together just remember the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own someone must be able to push but what a great product	14
1	well the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great compared to other battery operated shavers i agree my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys	14
1	this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer you can do a real professional job with these two items robert paul jone	14
0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf 203c cascadia showerhead it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal sedondly even with the head made of plastic the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall we installed it repeatedly following each step of the instructions every time thinking we were missing something i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon	14
1	very good very satisfying interesting blend of flavors dried fruit cocoa chili nothing dominates all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat i could n't eat one every day but for an occasional meal replacement it is very good too high calorie to be a snack item but it 's tempting	14
1	i have been very satisfied with the monitor it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included a quick phone call had them on the way i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time etc all in all it is a quite satisfactory device	14
1	this product is totally awesome it works great no problems at all since i have mostly carpteting in my apartment i have to move it to a hard surface every time i want to use it it zeros perfectly every time and gives me an accurate reading when compared to the doctors scale	14
1	i love this product it just tastes great especially with milk	14
0	i had this model or at least it looked the same for a few years and it worked exceptionally well it finally broke down recently and i thought i was lucky enough to find it again but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all actually it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done which of course is like not having it done at all	14
0	this product states 4 toothbrushes that is incorrect it only holds 3 this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter that is also incorrect you cannot use 4 aa i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me if those things do n't bother you it might be what you are looking for but since it does bother me i never even tried it	14
0	do n't bother with these i am a school nurse and not just this brand but most brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal i had to use the ear type for 8 years between pediatric icu and school nursing i got pretty good at getting consistent readings except on very small ear canals and those with a lot of wax we got rid of ours and went with an exergen temporalscanner temporal artery thermometer it takes less time does n't require probes and you can get one at costco for 30	14
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out not only did it not work for anything it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass also it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener needless to say i 'll be taking this back for an exchange i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair	14
0	the monitor works really well the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking if you are looking for a good basic monitor this is a great unit	14
1	for me a good tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer i had the same one this brand for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment i immediately ordered my new tweezer if not dropped i suspect this would last a lifetime	14
1	the mirror is great i use it for shaving my face and it fits the bill perfectly both the normal and 5x mirrors are nice and clear	14
0	the idea was great and i did enjoy the warm lotion however i used it three times and put it back in the box the on off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time i turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out would love to recommend it but i just ca n't i use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up	14
0	owned for 2 5 years finaly broken the conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it totaly agree	14
0	having owned several panasonic wet dry shavers over a 20 year period i can with authority say that this model is a big disappointment the battery life is outstanding but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor the next time i wo n't pinch pennies the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference	14
0	much too rough and dry for our baby if you want to find good baby wipes i recommend the pampers sensitive wipes which are soft and moist	14
0	the design is great very light easy to handle it 's very nice to be able to use it cordless however this is the least powerful epilator i have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history \( i have gone through six epilators \) it takes forever to clear a small area	14
1	these paper towels are as good as any cheaper paper towels they are not cloth like or super thick but they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the same price that are n't made of recycled materials in short they are cheap and better for the environment than non recycled chlorine bleached products	14
1	now i finally have the look and feel of a celebrity the best product on earth period ! i 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me ive' spent thousand of dollars nothing comes close to it forget about it saliylic acid is history in my book sorry dermatologist their is a cure i bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 since the new year 2007 started i 've already bought 2 bottle 's and i'm spreading the word do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face j diaz aka \( papi rico	14
0	i was so excited about this product but when i got it i was deeply dissatisfied the box was damaged it was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides i will be returning this product for a replacement i do think that the box is really cute however if i receive another damaged box then i will never buy another thing from this website	14
1	casein is a great long lasting protein perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey casein in general is bland \( think no fat no salt cottage cheese \) and harder to mix than whey optimum nutrition has here a decent casein that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein i 've tried the price is ok but i 'd like to see it cheaper \( who would n't \? \) i mix it with whey and use it throughout the day i have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor	14
1	having tried most all energy drinks i can honestly say this one is different guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped one at noon and i'm good to go for the rest of the day plus i do n't go home and kick the dog ! the taste is not sugary and at about 1 40 a can \( free shipping \) the price speaks for itself	14
0	original purchase had two dead batteries then a replacement set had the same results it 's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order but the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low made in china	14
1	i received this chair very quickly even though it was close to christmas the chair was wonderful ! such a great price for such a great chair	14
0	this is an expensive fanny pack not impressed to enough room for diapers etc	14
0	i was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when i found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early i tried fiddling with the dst setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than i wanted the brightness may be a problem for some people but i found it reasonable overall a good docking station but a poor alarm clock	14
0	i thought they might 've improved the hgm 15 model forget about it both models are lousy buy foreign it might work better	14
1	smells divine ! this is a powder sweet and refreshing scent that wo n't overwhelm the senses it 's soft and subtle yet killer if it complements your body chemistry i love using this particular fragrance \( especially during special occasions \) it exudes both simplicity and sophistication wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy ! ! ! try it	14
0	was initially impressed with the backrest however because the straps are not adjustable it dose n't stay in place the one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place	14
0	i'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened my general experience with cross pens has been very positive this one however is awful it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere	14
0	i bought this from amazon and i do n't like it the masured temperature drifts from 96 8f to 99 6f in 6 minutes so inaccurate	14
1	initially the sensation made me giggle after a couple uses i got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly my teeth feel cleaner mouth fresher and i'm hopeful that i will no longer get the floss lecture from my dental team now that 's something to smile about !	14
1	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out while i do n't use it everday i use it regularly and when needed i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated this nivea after shave is wonderful it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on it gets your day off to a great start no funky smells or textures here give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
0	we have only had this showerhead for one month already the nozzles are clogging the spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall do not purchase this product if you have hard water	14

1	i love this book light ! it has survived countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old it works great with hardback and paperback books this is by far the best book light i have ever used	14
0	this thing is horrible cumbersome to use and does nothing i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug carpet i'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it 0	14
1	optimum nutrition 's 100 whey protein is hands down the best i have tried and i have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years i used to be committed to eas and labrada but i found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to on whey protein i mix it with water and sometimes soy milk it mixes easy does n't taste gritty and is pure protein it goes down very easy and i have no trouble digesting it plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan plus the price is reasonable	14
0	first of all the battery that was supposed to be enclosed was not when i bought a 9 volt battery and installed it it would not stay attached when putting it back in the battery compartment finally i got a read out and entered my height and age then i stood on the scale and got nothing no weight no body fat nothing but the word error at which point i boxed it up and sent it back for a refund	14
1	my physician introduced me to this item he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods is affordable and easy to use oh did i forget to mention accurate compaired to a scale model i own amazon is great to order from the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !	14
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time	14
1	i bought the remington mb 300 mustache and beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky he has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed the remington has several adjustments for length that pleases him the most it trims whatever he aims it at and does it well it is light weight and maneuvers easily	14
0	in two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds do n't waste your money the 11 sunbeam dial scale is more accurate	14
0	it 's quality is cheap and poorly made i bought two thinking it was a good deal but i threw them out after 2 days because the on off switch did n't work it was also very loud	14
1	i absolutely love this scale ! it is easy to program and enjoyable to use best of all it 's beautiful to behold	14
0	the massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone there is only 1 heat setting which is ok but it 's a bit hot for only one setting it 's like the high setting on my 3 setting hot pad	14
1	my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old ! !	14
0	this may work well but the cuff size is not as it is in the description it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches not even close my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far sure you can get the cuff to go around your arm but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly and there was just no way to even come close	14
1	i have used opti free enzymatic cleaner for years still with the same great results i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer because my using extended wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock	14
0	this bp monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use bp from monitor checked closely with manual bp after the first 2 weeks got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries i can not rely on this monitor for my patient 's b p results	14
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track i was figuring on getting an arm unit but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work the whole system is very easy to use and fast you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy i can say this was a great gift something i use a lot and something that will help me stay healthy	14
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle she adores the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly not to mention that i a hearty creature in my prime love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors	14
1	clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you your family and the enviroment	14
1	i bought this straightner at walmart for about the same price found on amazon and i really like it i bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does i wanted a chi but i could n't pass this one up for the price i 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well a good product for the price ! !	14
1	this has an average scent i have bought other brands of reed diffusers that i like alot more i would not buy this again	14
0	i'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so i do n't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer i follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before i get a consistent reading i threw mine away	14
1	when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out just enough to see your baby by but not enough to keep everyone awake it 's been almost a year now and i'm just about to purchase two more we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine we use it every night	14
1	this omron blood pressure monitor is ok but not as good in my opinion as my old one from the same company this one does n't print out results although it does store them also the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome	14
1	i used the huggies overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training i used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull ups to get him through the night without leaks but even that did n't work very well finally huggies came out with an overnight pull up and it really works well ! ! ! excellent product	14

0	i wanted to buy this for my daughter i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill ins with my new scrapbooking hobby the outside is precious but once you open it the pages are like a black and white newspaper material and they have no structure what so ever the pages are boring and do n't look very durable	14
1	i bought this item for my husband for christmas he has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him we use these pillows everyday sitting up watching tv and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps the only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores !	14
0	i bought this pricey little bottle of lens dr hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake ! it did nothing but make it worse ! after i saw what it did to the lenses i had to scrape and scrub to get it off ! i hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product a big rip of	14
0	it was so so and didnt see any real results but it was definently better than tend skin or mi	14
1	hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushhead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards i use the soft brushhead because i used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen but since using the hydrabrush and the 8 brushes \( 4 on each side \) i do n't have to worry about missing when i brush my teeth excellent product	14
0	i tried this product because i had been using arthred g powder which was discontinued this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it it tasted and smelled rather like soap if you used arthred g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage there is no comparison here ! ! ! i would totally avoid this product	14
0	the razor i bought came with packets of this gel as well as the lotion possibly due to the consistency the gel gets used up more quickly it is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is the key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol the gel has menthol so that 's why it can be irritating i read a review of shaving basics online and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol the lotion on the other hand always helps get a better shave and is quite soothing	14
0	i agreed with all the criticism that the revlon eyelash curler \( now discontinued \) received it broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload but the one thing it did well that the carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin this instrument catches my skin very easily and it 's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids	14
0	i bought this press to do crafts the dimensions i were given were completely wrong i was told the product in inches \( l x w x h \) 9 0 x 20 0 x 15 0 it really is barely 6 1 2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long 17 inces long at the angle it was so small that i could maybe iron one sock at a time also the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website	14
1	the sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful ! it does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it and it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours the light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well	14
0	although it kept time \( which indicates the batteries were good \) this did n't work the first day i used it it worked the second day it stopped working by the third day and the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost this was a complete waste of 19	14
0	this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and i only wear it 4 6 hours a night this product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so i like the design and it does n't cut up my mouth but i ca n't be replacing it every other month	14
1	this hair dryer is truly a professional salon type dryer many dryers are advertised as such but this one lives up to that reputation very sleek beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature this was a surprise \( turbo \) which i'm enjoying coupled with the smooth and strong drying the sound is even pleasant not too loud and it works quickly \( especially since i have very thick hair \) i would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price aj in n	14

1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids but i find it perfect for me it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber what more can you ask for	14
0	the battery life is the worst of any electric razor i 've ever used the razor does n't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses the razor is very cheaply constructed and i would not recommend this to anyone you 're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine	14
1	i have had omord hr 100c for a few months now i use it wile on my treadmill it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand the hr 100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor	14
1	although the compartments seem small you can fit lots of food into this bowl it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections so you can separate your veggies meat etc the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break \( so i use it to store food in the fridge i have all of the other fit fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken	14
0	too hard to use so i paid 50 for an 18 hairdryer maybe if i watched the video i could use it bette	14

0	i purchased this item the middle of may it is now oct 1st and it wo n't heat up anymore ! product should last longer than 5 months !	14
0	the batteries that come with this charger we 're not a problem for me in fact i was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine i was however disappointed in the charger the charger requires that all four aa batteries be in the charger for it to work you cannot charge just one two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted also there are a maximum of two slots for aaa batteries and when they are in use none of the other aa slots are usable given the price of nimh batteries the charger works out to be about 2 which is about what it 's worth at best	14
0	i bought this iron for my teen daughters actually i bought it twice since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping both times it died the first iron lasted about 6 months and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies no warning my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research	14
1	convenient to use good battery life good shave for an electric shaver but still not as good as a blade also a little hard to use at edges such as sideburns under and around nose	14
1	i called nature made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury their fish oil is usp tested for purity and potency there is n't any mercury free fish oil however nm contains only 01 mcg g of mercury very low level and certainly not toxic i'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently fyi they have a great website that contains all this information	14
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too a v close shave in about 2 minutes i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness i dont use the cleaning station i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased	14
1	i have used this twice a day and love it best buy at this price	14
1	easy on the back and shoulders as this is very light it does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming my 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy ! i bought this in a drug and discount store for 13 95 it 's worth that	14
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it it gets very hot warm very fast and is very comforting i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches i would recommend this product to anyone i'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift	14
1	this works best for me i do n't like a wet or greasy look this holds well then dries as if nothing is on the hair without it my hair falls down into my eyes i think it 's the best	14
1	i have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down as other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base it makes dry shaving extremely smooth as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess you can use this with any type of electric not just remingtons and it 's very easy to clean out just tap it out and or blow and or brush highly recommende	14
1	recieved product on time and i wil for sure order from this company agai	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
0	the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style it makes my arm and finger tired	14
0	i purchased the product found it to be not accurate also in order to get your ldl result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it costly ! ! cumbersome ! ! ! 3 times niddle your fingers ! ! i returned the product	14
0	i bought the goggles and was excited by the look they are kind of riddick like they had disappoiinting performance when i rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face they did float and so i found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened i gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing they definately are not for extreme sports they are also too big for casual use as sun glasses	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
1	i bought this as a trial product because the other stuff that i bought did n't work as what they advertise it but this dusters picks up the dust instead of pushing to another place this refills is quite cheap and it make my cleaning job much easier	14
0	after 5 days of minimal use this pad stopped working kaz replaced it after 3 days of use the pad stopped working again kaz replaced it again after 7 days of use the pad stopped working a third time but this time kaz voided the warranty ! then they said i should get an electric blanket if i wanted to keep warm i wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache	14
1	these batteries work well they do n't last as long as normal batteries but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs if you have kids with toys these are a must	14
0	does not measure up to the shihatsu 110 ac messager which actually works this unit has multiple vibrating buzzers i could not feel the heat the motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids' giant bass speakers	14
0	i bought this item for the warmth the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on as for the massage it 's about what i expected no good at all overall i would say this item is worthless	14
1	as a tape measure it does what it says it does you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part you wo n't have to worry about did i hold the tape tigher last time \? as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time the tape starts measurement at 2 since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches i think this tape is accurate plus or minus half an inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level	14
0	all i wanted was a bottle that i could use to mix y protein but this stupid things leaks every time because the lid doesnt fit right you 'd think something with only one purspoe would adequately fill that role well in this case it does n't	14
1	i was looking for a lightweight simple wet dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies the panasonic wes9941p fit perfectly gives a nice shave and it 's so easy to clean it replaces my old braun single head linear \( i like the panasonic better \) the batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close	14
0	this item is advertised as boufant and oversized it is anything but the shower cap is so tiny it would fit on a grapefruit this kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line	14
1	bought this for my husband who has a 2 hour \( one way \) commute by bus to work he loves it now he can nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck it is very portable with a small carrying case and is easy to blow up a bargain for the price	14
0	very simple review the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month then it did n't save your box if you buy this you may need to return it	14
1	i really liked the outside design of the book a lot of books were cartoonish and really was drawn to the look of the book i wish the book did not have so much random fill in pages i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events ages of the child but all in all i am pleased with it i would most likely buy again	14
1	this item is great it holds shampoo and conditioner or whatever liquids you need in the shower and also has a handy basket that i use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream the handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place however i had to buy this item from another vendor because amazon kept delaying shipment after the delays had exceeded a month i finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere good product bad transaction	14
1	i received this parfum as a birthday gift and i fell in love with it as soon as i smelled it the scent lasts all day without being too overbearing i swear every single time i wear this someone stops me and asks what am i wearing the fragrance is crisp and sensual it kind of reminds me of bath body works' moonlight path buy it you wo n't regret it especially for the price that amazon is offering it for	14
1	there are several listings for this item in different versions before making a decision check out the other versions you will see many different reviews overall it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended it works ! you can see my full review under zeno pro pink	14
0	these are just ok not great i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them the sunglasses however are not as sturdy the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses it 's a shame	14
1	i purchased this for my husband he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation	14
0	since our bathroom cabinet is short on space i loved the idea of this hair dryer ! unfortunately the idea was more a fantasy than a reality i only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord keeper button fell out \( spring and all ! \) and the retractible cord stopped retracting since that was the only reason i bought this one over other models i was sorely disappointed ! also this dryer is so l o u d that i had to wear earplugs \( no kidding ! \) while drying my hair so that i would n't damage my hearing ! hands down the worst hair dryer on the market	14
1	great product the girls had a blast with it real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair not all the time though still a fabulous product would highly recommend it my niece wishes it came with more gems	14
1	philips sent me a reprogram plug in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards most of the low price aed 's use camaera batteries my defibrillator has a long life lithium battary i wo n't risk someone 's life on store bought battaries walt blankenshi	14
0	if you get it wet it stops working which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush if you want something to work for a month or two its fine otherwise avoid it entirely i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture pretty quickly after ordinary use	14
1	just received this massager and my wife and i ca n't stop massaging each other with it especially great deal for the special amazon price i 've been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones \( that just fit in the palm of your hand \) glad i splurged only problem is that amazon site says 7 heads item description says 6 heads and actul product only included 5 heads the one missing from the picture on the box is the acu point heads i'm guessing that 's why it 's on sale \? still worth it if you get it on sale great massager	14
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent it is one of my favorites it smells exactly like cotton candy its fun flirty and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents then this one is for you	14
0	this product is great at exfoliating not so great at hair removal your skin will be silky smooth but still have hair the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product	14
1	this is a great drink i wanted to try something that was different and this definately fit in it isnt carbonated and tastes really good what i really wanted to know though was how it worked there is no caffeine or taurine and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary it worked well though and i was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it	14
1	i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it well made with good trim length settings it 's also easy to hold recommended	14
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas to my knowledge he has used it only once with no complaints was nice for the main reason he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it purchasing was a breeze thank yo	14
0	terrible reception tinny speaker radio does not remember last used station when turned off do n't waste your money	14
1	this is the best ! ! ! drys you off fast and drys fast too so soft and comfy on my skin ! !	14
1	they do n't seem small at all i would agree that it 's like a size 3 if you 're talking about toddler clothing but the diaper size is different my daughter wears 3t clothes size 5 easy ups	14
0	not really an improvement over standard mach 3 cartridges and certainly not worth the price jump the shave quality still does not match that by an old fashioned safety razor	14
0	it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells whistles i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great	14
1	i used this product and ca n't say enough good things about it my friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and i lost 30 pounds in 6 months and i was never hungry i ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my dietmate i love it thank yo	14
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick even in the middle of the holidays i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed	14
0	when i bought this the other review was n't posted yet now please benefit from our two reviews this thing is a total joke useless too small \( i have larger hotel samples \) i too would like to return this but i just do n't have time before christmas amazon should not offer this item it is a complete let down over priced and just a joke no fooling	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation at night it 's all you need	14
0	the light was very good the magnifier \( very tiny \) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses but the worst part were the tweezers in themselves they were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle also i am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair these did not so they do not tweeze well at all was n't worth all the bother of a return i just threw it away it was a good idea for a product just poorly made	14
0	this one is too small for a bedroom just like a toy i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701 000 ultrasonic humidifier which is much bigger generally speaking the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones	14
1	this is by far my favorite out of all the odwalla bars i used to purchase it at trader joe 's but they no longer carry this flavor so i was especially delighted when i saw it on amazon	14
0	these bars arrive smashed melting and stale taste like cardboard with dried blueberrie jam spread around on them awfu	14
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable not so ! they tear easily better than just empty wal mart bags though but not by much	14
1	this curling iron works well it heats quickly and i'm very satisfied	14
0	i recently bought 3 items from this brand lumiscope actually this is the only item that works among them though i am kind of suspicious about it 's inconsistent readings from time to time i think braun irt452 is a much better product which i bought one for my parents in china during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings	14
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet so i bought this specifically for that use i used the triangular pumice attachment only i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate but in general it 's just a vibrating \( 2 levels \) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference the actual machine has no function the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok but can easily be used without this machine	14
0	i was attempting to order aveda brilliant anti humectant pomade but received aveda brilliant humectant pomade the packaging is so similiar did not realize until i opened product that i had the wrong item either you sent the wrong item or i inadverantly ordered the wrong one because of packaging i was being very careful to follow every word so i wonder does aveda srill make the anti humectant pomade i am stuck with the wrong item now that i opened the jar at any rate i am not a happy customer with a product that will not meet my needs plus i am minus the 22 53 amount spent	14
0	broke after two uses buttons are hard to switch and drying time was not better than my old school model in fact my hair was frizzier i was kinda glad it broke i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this	14
1	we originally got this to replace the fan noise in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold the first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it we 've discovered it 's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night with the adjustability dials it 's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan it does n't however cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise especially for children	14
1	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow it is abrasive to the skin i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly other than that it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many	14
1	this is the razor to use ! excellent product does what is says	14
0	i got the machine for my fat muscle and water analysis as well as my weight after 1 month of use it only shows the weight the scale no longer works properly it no longer shows anything else but the weight it was a waste of money	14
1	10 bucks and does the job you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do	14
0	i recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the andis company 22560 rechargeable cord cordless hair clipper kit	14
0	does not maintain water temp splashes all over at the proper water level rollers hurt noisy weak vibrations i would n't want one for 5	14
1	it usually takes forever for me to dry my hair but it dried really fast and straight ! i can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer ! and the color is beautiful i just love orange o	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
0	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap even if i really tighten it up i still get a small leak when i shake it also the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy but overall it gets the job done and having fluid graduations on the side are nice	14
1	the biosafe thyroid test is accurate and simple to use the results came back in less than a week and matched my doctor 's results ! thanks biosafe	14
1	this give an excellent finish to a shave i strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well apply hot water to dilate your pores then apply the oil then shaving cream shave and finally the after shave balm the oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience your face feels incredibly smooth afterward i do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone but i do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after	14
0	i do n't know how this works because when i found that i would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work i returned it it is n't evident in the advert for this \( or any other \) heart rate monitor i guess i 'll have to trust my sense of pain	14
0	order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time i do not know how long because i am still waiting	14
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
1	shaves great wet or dry i like it because it pivots real good no cuts it was worth every penny	14
0	this scale is too small i have size 11 feet and my feet dont fit on the scal	14
1	i bought this bag for my husband as a surprise \( as i had bought another brand and he did not like the asian floral print \) it 's very roomy looks great fits ergonomically i really love the pocket design and the space that they have as well as the interior design fits things better than my own bag ! my husband loves it and ca n't wait to use it ! plus that this is the best price i 've seen online and of course amazon ships quickly and accurately	14
1	very happy with this purchase received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an credit card it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings	14
0	please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site or at the very least practice honesty in advertising this unit is so small that all it good for is ties shorts and socks i feel violated by amazon and conair	14
1	clean fresh subtle scent not at all flowery musky or heavy just a clean fresh beautiful scent have n't found anything better and the price is nice too	14
1	i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately 9 00 22 00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon	14

1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
1	i was very suprised at how small the units were \( i ordered 2 \) but they work great and run very quietly the filter is very easy to change i have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that i switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space i would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money	14
0	too difficult to program have had 2 weeks and still have notbeen able to complete process instructions stay on screentoo short a time all i am able to get is weight cannot seeother information on screen unless on floor and right on topof it would send back but too much of a hassel and expense too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my currentweigh	14
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb i tried contacting the company with this new one u cannot get an answer the company seems to have a non working number other than that the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it	14
1	works great no problems after 4 months	14
0	i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b c it claims to be better than proactiv after using proactiv for a month then trying this stuff acnefree does n't compare to proactiv granted this is better than a bar of soap but it 's definately worth spending the extra 20 to get proactiv	14
1	it takes some getting used to but once you do you will love it it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush electric or other that i have ever used you feel at first like it is totally strange \( it is ! \) does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else i have no buyers remorse i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle	14
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser but in the satin finish from the first only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work \( yes we followed the instructions carefully \) two months later another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable instead of this loser try the dispenser 71450 classic iv we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty but so what it works and the aviva does n't	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
1	i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago the pain was gone after the first night and it has n't come back since then it supports my neck perfectly i highly recommend	14
0	manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs as this device is very fragile not a good consumer product	14
0	this one 's going back to the store it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat if you ask me my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat as for the massage it 's worthless to me but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway i prefer shiatsu i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet	14
0	fails at it most basic function to provide a non leaking seal you might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to coverthe top	14
0	there are two thing that i do n't like about this set the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient i would n't recommend them	14
0	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff but now they do i guess this is considered an improvement but i bought them for an elderly cat and she ca n't reset the control every hour they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff	14
0	these did not suppress my appetite though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil \( also a hoodia product \) but the next bottle of that nothing i guess like crops you can get good batches and bad batches these struck me as a bad batch as one reviewer said i actually felt hungrier many days egad ! better luck next time ! sigh	14
1	all there products are great ! they smell good and are good lathering is a more work but thats because they 're natural i use them on my babies and toddlers	14

1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
1	i 've used a nylon scrubbie for years the salux bath towel is much better ! i received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was it has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator i use it with a bath gel \( never soap it 's too drying \) and my skin has never been softer it 's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back it drys very quickly ca n't live without it	15

0	a complete waste of money i still have all my stretch mark	15
1	this nail polish is by far the best nail product i have ever purchased ! i stumbled accross it in france two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since the brush is great depositing the polish smoothly and thinly the product dries quickly and lasts a long time it is amazing	15
1	i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove but that 's just me i'm not a huge clove fan but it worked great made my hair scalp feel awesome will definitely buy this again and i ca n't wait to try other lush products	15
1	i'm a sort of sweaty type so i usually like an antiperspirant deodorant but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash and it 's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy aromarant is quick and easy to use does n't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge	15
1	i am very impressed with the whole bobbi brown line this lip gloss is no exception these lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end the colors are fantastic these glosses are all very neutral and natural looking colors none of these glosses are going to make you look too made up just make you look finished the texture is not too tacky or sticky and it has a light scent not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss i highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them	15
1	i have very sensitive skin a thick beard and must shave daily what a hellacious combination ! the art of shaving for sensitive skin is the best shaving cream i have found and i have been searching far and wide as for the rest of their products eh i could take them or leave them i e there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper this shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non comudegenic \( sp \? \) oils that really protect your skin	15
1	i just got out of the shower a minute ago and i must say this is the best shampoo i 've ever bought my scalp has n't felt this clean and fresh in a long time washing my super thick and waist length hair did n't feel like a chore for once and i actually look forward to my next washing the smell reminds me of the hippie shops on haight street in san francisco i love it	15
1	i wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that i have are horrificly sticky and if they are n't sticky they do not stay on for long this one however manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick the color \( apple a day \) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and does n't go anywhere it also has no stickyness ! yay ! i love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs !	15
0	it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads enlarged pores using this extractor is equal to using one 's fingers to squeeze out imperfections which may produce very temporary results but is ultimately fruitless those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep cleaning instead which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation	15
1	body so fine is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic i ever had i recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real it 's the most delicious velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms also the retro chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful perfect for me	15
1	i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously lumpy legs i ca n't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot i 've done weight loss programs before and they 've never addressed the cellulite issue this is the first thing that has seemed to work and it 's great moisturizer too	15
1	i am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products i received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty \( also good \) i was blown away by how this product made my skin feel i have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer this scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft i am totally hooked ! you will love it too totally worth the money	15
1	i 've never liked my lashes until i put this on what a difference	15
0	i bought this with a kit this stuff was just not worth it to me but unlike the others i cannot stand the smell it is very strong and gave me a headache so i could not really leave it on that long my scalp did feel conditioned though but if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you	15
0	on my third use i set it down on the carry case and it sizzled i looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord right where it is connected to the handle ! i immediately unplugged it and now there 's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out i am so grateful i was n't using it on my hair when this happened ! what with the straightening balm i was using and everything my hair could 've easily started on fire	15
1	i absolutely love this product ! it 's been effective on both my natural and now permed hair it 's worth the price i have n't found anything on the market to match it yet	15
1	after hearing so many good things about philosophy 's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it wo n't last long on your body after taking a shower i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed overall a great product	15
1	this stuff smell delicious who can resist \? i love it ! ! smells like chocolate mint to me love i	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
0	i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving the product claims to reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps ingrown hairs and redness from shaving but despite it 's lofty promises and high price it does none of this in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol the directions tell you to apply it after shaving but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving it only made my problem worse i wish i could have rated this product zero stars because it is absolutely worthless	15
1	this product is very well built the mirrors are clear and free from any distortion magnification level is just right the only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable	15
1	i am very glad with my purchase it gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one i am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and i prefer tinted moisturizers happy light gives even complexion without being heavy it also offers sun protection spf 15 if you do n't need more than medium coverage it is worth considering this brand	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
1	i 'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when i tried burberry brit 's eau de toilette one day i could n't believe how wonderful the scent was especially after it had been on for a while i splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time \( even with almost daily use it 's still mostly full \) i consider this to be my signature scent and get many compliments on it	15
0	was n't anything special you can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that 's half the price	15
1	i use this constantly i 've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora i do n't blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry not too much but it 's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way i 've reccomended this to everyone	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance when i put this on i get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours i put the spray cologne version of falling in love on top to brighten it up a bit when i feel like it it is subtle but i think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering definitely something my husband wants to be near	15
1	if you have n't tried lush or creamy candy do it ! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft for soap to match try rock star mmmmm ! ! ! i ca n't place the fragrance it 's cherry but not cotton candy but not it 's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts enjoy	15
0	i love the scent of this bathbomb but the clean up is annoying noone wants to take a nice bath and then have to get out the tub cleaner afterwards but now i can finally use this bomb again someone advised my to put the bomb in an old nylon to catch the petals this worked fine but took a little away from the whole bath expeirence to have to watch an old nylon float around meif you love the scent then its worth it if its only so so to you move on because this ones a mes	15
1	this product is worth the price ! i use it every day especially my whole eye area and i love it ! it does not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy either	15
0	i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly kinky hair it did n't do anything for my hair and i did n't like the smell \( but its not that big of a deal \) i returned it i do n't think its for coarse kinky curls but maybe for others textures lt for coarse 'naturals' try carol 's daughter 's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line	15
0	after reading reviews of the other philosophy items i was hoping this would smell more like a strawberry milkshake than fake strawberry quick	15
1	love love love this scent i have received many compliments about it long lasting and definitely addictive i think its more of a late fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	15
0	i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there 's just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it 's oil free it did n't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you 're looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf	15
1	definitely a must have perfume ! the smell is just awesome not too strong not too mild and stays for long i strongly recommend this it is also a great gift	15
1	if you need something to get you going in the morning shock therapy will do it we 're talking major minty shower gel here your skin will be tingling the smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain a gift note this would be a good gift for someone who does n't like flowery bath products even guys would like this	15
1	i bought this mostly because of how obsessed i am with pink sugar this product smells sweet it smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house i personally think of this as a good thing i love candy food scents my perfume collection is such that i am suprised i'm not followed everywhere i go by a swarm of bees if you 're looking for a sophisticated scent please do n't buy this or pink sugar if you are looking to have people ask hey do you smell a delicious cake \? everytime you walk past buy away and who does n't want to smell like a delicious cake \?	15
1	this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo	15
1	this scent is truly intoxicating i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore this product line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume how nice is that ! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good	15
1	i really like using this product the color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle i like using this after i have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older the shimmer powder does n't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look	15
1	i bought this last month in purple looks awesome and it does n't hurt when you put it on best of all it stays on and if you set it it will stay all day	15
1	i have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck that dream cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks i 've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after i get out of the shower on my legs it has completely gotten rid of the red bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter i 've tried dozens of body lotions creams and this is my absolute favorite	15
1	i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled ! the box itself is decorative and i re used it as a pencil holder on my desk the scent is very aromatic and long lasting i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house i was very pleased	15
0	okay but does not keep cool for long i do like the massage effect from the beads	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
0	i 've had excellent luck with tweezerman products in the past but the quality of this blackhead remover was second rate the item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw in attachments neither attachments really work the threading of both seems to be flawed and to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face no thanks ! my e mailed request for re threading or replacement to tweezerman went unanswered this purchase was an expensive mistake	15
1	when i ordered i didnt read the word double so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now	15
1	i just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized kabuki brush i find i like the baby buki better it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which i love	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	this is a life changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing you just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow and it provides a perfect base twelve hours later the shadow is still perfectly in place i bought this at a neiman marcus store but the product is so good i wanted to make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it is !	15
0	i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it	15
1	simplify simplify simplify ! that 's what i try to do with my beauty routine hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one step cleanser i'm staying with it because it works no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers one step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished it 's both easy and effective	15
1	ok i have really large lips and for years i have tried everything to protect them get this tin for some reason the stick does n't work as well and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day it 's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily trust me i have tried everything even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
1	of all the other caswell massey scents i 've tried some are kind of old fashioned smelling high quality soaps in luxurious packaging not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps i 've tried	15
1	i love this product it 's a lot more natural looking than foundation and saves a step in the morning it does a good job evening out skin tone and it feels good on my dry skin as someone who does n't wear a lot of makeup it adds that extra bit of polish that makes for a more professional appearance without looking too made up	15
1	cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance that certainly is chanel no 22 it 's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no 5 coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no 22 for the year it was presented it may have been created in 1922 but it 's as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray	15
1	if you 're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done nioxin system scalp therapy is the answer \( the numbers only represent the type of hair you have use a lower number if your hair is more fine \) use this once or two times after color and the scalp itch goes away the product claims to help thinning hair i have no issue with that and i think i found an off market use for the product but it works for me so i 'll take it	15
1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	15
1	here 's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list a cute lip gloss ring from hard candy the ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss it comes in three shades and glosses heartbreaker which is a peach kiss me which is hot pink and yummy which is baby blue all are fruit scented boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid \( presentation you know \) it 's finger fun	15
1	i love this fragance it 's my favorite no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it i love it	15
0	i'm black and for my hair type 4b i try to use natural products on my hair and it did n't have those no no chemicals and oils that are known to be damaging to black hair well this product did not as it advertised which was to stay put i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb coils or finger coil in place i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good sad thing is that i ca n't get my money back i use it as a hair grease for my scalp i hope i 've been helpful	15
1	this is a treat to wear i alternate it with my secret sparkling lily clear gel deodorant the fresh deodorant does n't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating it smells just like fresh 's sugar perfume sweet and lemony but does n't last as long that 's why i only gave it 4 stars it also does n't cake or pill up like other deodorants this is my favorite deodorant	15
0	beware ! it is a fake not a real genuine mac lipstick do not buy the amplified creme from this seller he has only fakes amplified cremes i got a few	15
0	i was n't really thrilled with this product it smells great but as soon as the shower is over the thrill is gone	15
0	used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had not recommended at least for medium wavy hair no frizz control	15
0	i bought this and shortly after i started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling i did n't know what was going on and i stopped using it and it immediately went away as soon as i started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back i am a person who does n't break out very often and i can tolerate many products i now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it has n't faded yet i tried to take it back to nordstrom and they would n't exchange it this product sucks and as it was the only one i was using i know thats what caused the swelling	15
1	i absolutely fell in love with this fragrance it smells like a day at the county fair absolutely lovely you have to layer it though to make it last wash with the shower gel put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath \( perfumes stick better that way while you 're moist \) and then spray if you wash your hair spray while your blow drying it out carry the spray in your purse you will need to touch up during the day	15
0	love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product ! well this one used to have about 3 five star ratings i added my two cents this product did nothing for me whatsoever so some people love it i do n't get it and it 's pretty much the opposite of an anti oxidant so that does n't make sense i pointed this out in my review wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough \? also it 's listed at 45 on amazon as well from the same supplier huh	15
1	i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this product although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there this product is great totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne yes it 's pricey but i think it 's worth every penny	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	15
1	even better than i expected ! light fresh scent that is not overly sweet	15
1	after a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8 hours and a brutal workout after i came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience i have ever had by myself with a bath bar ! \) the cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar the cool air in the bathroom mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing blissful enjoyable shower i feel great ! i 'll sleep great tonight ! this experience has made me a lush customer for life	15
1	this smells so wonderful ! wear it and you will get compliments it seems like it might be a summertime only scent \( i e very tropical \) but i 'd wear it year round i only wish they made a larger size in the oil	15
0	actually i would give the product 5 stars and the packaging a minus 2 citylips really does work plumping and hydrating it does required repeated applications but the packaging results in about 10 12 of the \( expensive \) material being completely unavailable ! worse if you try to wiggle the \( too short \) applicator in order to get the last 10 the container breaks at the neck \( actually one came already cracked in my case ! \) true they do offer some colors at 2 3 price but most effective is to apply clear and go outside the lipline and the clear almost never has gone on sale !	15
1	this tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both as a rn with dermatology experience i have used many tools i like this one as it saves you from bruising or squishing your skin so it solves the problem with a minimum of damage if you have n't used anything like this it may take some getting used to but it 's way better than using your fingers i gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small	15
1	the ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy the scent is strong but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting this soap is also so moisturizing that my skin does n't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels this particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a bath and body works shower gel and lotion fiend	15
0	i should have known better people were telling me to use dermaaction from www topicalbeauty com but i wasted my money on hylexin instead saw no results dermaaction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now next time i 'll listen	15
1	i 've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent but i have to say i love it this lotion takes me back to my child hood it 's got a strawberry quick bubblegum smell to it i think it 's fun for summer days	15
1	lush makes a few products with lemon but i think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of vetivert the earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil use this conditioner after the daddy o shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake i can also recommend the honey trap lip balm and the smitten hand cream all that jas is also a wonderful product for the bath the rebecca review	15
1	i purchased this product based on the reviews and i ca n't begin to tell you how glad i am to have the hair honey it is wonderful ! ! it leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy the smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater i will be using this for a long time to come	15
1	this is an excellent product but i have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face at first i thought it was because i used too much but even when i use only a tiny amount it is still white it will certainly suit persons with pale complexions wish there was a tint to it	15
1	citylips has made my lips larger ! i love the clear i use it all day long i will buy this product again	15
1	subtle yet powerful ! i love this scent i actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance many compliments from men women a little spritz does the trick ! you can also purchase a sheer moisturizing body spray perfect for daytime wear especially during the summer pricey but definately worth it ! !	15
1	i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull ! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description i got a small sample bottle and fell in love it is perfect for the winter fall seasons not so much for the summer it 's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means but i still feel special	15
1	i'm sure that you do n't need any more assurance but just to let you know i 've had my tweezerman 's for over 5 years now they are still sharp ! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably would n't be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have	15
0	in all honesty i 'd rate the fragrance itself as 5 stars however the scent does not last for love nor money which is why i give it a mere 1 star you 'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and consequently before you know it you 've depleted your perfume ! talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and if they 're honest they will tell you exactly what i 've written here because i adore the scent i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect	15
0	this stuff is very expensive and i 've diligently used it as the directions state i havent seen growth i am actually losing more eyelashes ! ! i was going to buy the mascara if i grew the eyelashes but it does n't seem to be working sigh	15
1	i have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head the results are great no unwated shine no gooiness very easy to wash off your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged reasonably priced and more available every day	15
1	i first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester i fell in love with the sweet sugary light smell of it and so did my husband it 's perfect for all seasons since it 's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you 're wearing i 've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet now i want to try some of their other fragrances if they are half as good as this they win in my book	15
0	for me it barely looked like i had mascara on at all i have blonde eyelashes so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop and this did n't really i ended up giving it to my mom thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it and she did n't like it either it ended up in the garbage i 've loved dior show mascara and of course great lash i 'd recommend those over this especially for the money	15
0	i purchased this item after seeing jonathan 's show as much as i enjoyed his program i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible it weighed down my hair and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling ! the day after using the product my hair looked like an oil slick ! i do wish jonathan much success but these products need a lot of work very disappointing after spending almost 60 for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard	15
1	for the price this product is great the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time the scent was light and fragrant not over powering like some other products for those who love their bubble baths highly recommended	15
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
1	for some reason chicks dig this aroma i 've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction i'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so i decided to write this review with my luck they 'll stop making the stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just in case	15
1	this stuff smells just like philosophy 's handmade hand cream but not as strong that 's why i took one point off it has a light sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background of course it 's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3 1 's if it where stronger scented it would be my favorite	15
1	i love this kit my skin feels like velvet new blemishes clear up in a day or 2 and my makeup goes on easier than ever i love philosophy and i 've just bought the booster shots kit to increas ethe effectivness philosophy has gotten me addicted to skincar	15
0	nanoparticles \? \? \? \? i was in the process of re ordering this item until i read the description apparently you 're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe thanks a lot lancome ! not on my face !	15
1	i have to admit i'm a very picky perfume shopper but flower by kenzo is amazing is light flowery elegant casual truly wonderful	15
0	product made my hair sticky and gooey i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market needs re formulatin	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
0	this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake it is watery and does not lather my hair felt like it had n't been washed for days and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting 10 00	15
1	this product is perfect for dreadlocks i buy it whenever i am in the us i live in the caribbean and even in the extreme heat this stuff is the best for my hair type	15
0	i am dissatisfied with lush 's claims that many of its products like this one are natural i encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in lush 's products i have yet to see a lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety there are numerous other brands of truly all natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently	15
1	this fragrance smells great if you have used the awesome fresh lemon sugar shower gel it smells exactly the same it smells much better than the other sugar fragrance that has been around a long time this one is clean and fresh and uplifting	15
0	i will keep this review short the product does not work period i have been using the product morning and evening since the begining of february and have not seen a single change i just bought some olay eye cream a week ago and can already see an improvement	15
1	i love zoya nail polish and this is the best summer color ever	15
1	i absolutely love this scent i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you 'll love this	15
1	i want one in every color it glides on very smooth and the color lasts	15
0	it stings burns and irritated my skin didnt prevent any breakouts i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most 0 stars if i could need i say more	15
1	i love this shampoo it make my hair so soft and shiny i cut the shampoo in four and use it every other day then i keep it at dry place this shampoo last long too the smell is great too love it ! i'm going to buy it for my mom	15
1	foams nicely in the tub rinses away cleanly skin is n't left with any film instead your skin is left very soft and with a good scent falling in love smells sweet and relaxing and makes me think of cotton candy the large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower	15
1	i used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones i was impressed with the results it leaft my hair with much needed moisture and very shiny i normally apply the realxer myself at home but i choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states the smell was not noticeable which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong it did n't burn my scalp like most have the quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give i think that it was worth the price ! i 'll be buying it again	15
1	i have started taking this supplement a month ago and i feel my hair is stronger than ever also my hair loss has became minimal ! besides that my nails are harder i love it	15
1	this is the second time i have ordered these blades for my husband he has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he 's ever used that last anywhere near this long regular blades dull almost right away \( sorry he 's not here or i 'd ask for the details from him i do n't know how long a long time is \) but at 50 he 's tried a lot of blades ! he says never buy him anything else again so i guess these are the best ! ! !	15
1	this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt update trufitt and hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems they sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as massey it is good the standard is still substandard	15
0	i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line any benefits i thought i was getting from lush out the window their products seemed all the sudden unimpressive and i really like that melt is denver based ! try them out and see what you think for yourself \( if you are n't here in colorado i know they have online products too \) and make your own choice i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch !	15
1	this is by far the most delicious scent ever no other perfume comes even close i use it everyday and it is worth every cent	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
1	this is a nice smell that turns babypowderish on me my fiancee luvs it he is also a huge fan of chanel no	15
1	i love lemon curd so i was quite happy to discover philosophy 's frozen lemon custard lip shine the consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well this is by far my favorite lip shine scent	15
0	so i 've owned a tweezerman extractor before and i am now questioning why i didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar this extractor is no help what so ever the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that i would press the right pore its just too small to even target the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful you could damage your skin i would recommend not buying this extractor i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman	15
1	i had tried all kinds of skin care systems with different levels of success but in the end the derma step system works the best with long lasting results you can get a free trial and see for yourself here http things4free biz dermaste	15
1	i love the fresh scent of the avobath there 's just nothing like it it smells like springtime to me i have yet to notice any glitter in an avobath bath \( and i 've taken about 10 \) so if you 're glitter shy do n't let that stop you from trying this one	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i still got the marks iwish it had of helped i used it for a while after giving birth but it did n't help	15
1	i love this stuff ! i have my mother 's hands as my sister calls them as the years go by they 're getting more and more wrinkly and i also have age spots i gave some to my sister last year and now she 's got me buying it too ! this hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy it 's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles you 'll love it too	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
0	this did not help my skin at all i would not reccomend it to anyone ! save your money !	15
1	i am a big fan of this product my hair is very strong it needs a product which can keep it tamed however most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which in my opinion is a bad look for today 's fashions the matte look is more flexible american crew fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold it also smells nice not to strong and not too girly	15
1	was using philosophy 's various light scents discovered this burberry london sample in my last sephora shipment went to macy 's and bought the set for under 77 lotion shower gel and 3 3 oz fragrance fretted over price until i actually used the products layering them recieved so many compliments ! not an old lady 's perfume not strong nor weak it has an elegant floral fragrance top notes rose clementine and honeysuckle heart notes tiare flower jasmine and peony dry down notes sandalwood veil of musk and patchouli all my favorites	15
1	i read many positive \( and very few negative \) reviews before i ordered my first tube i am 65 living in florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months the cream goes on smoothly and i have had no negative reaction friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking with less wrinkles in fact two friends based on my favorable experience are also planning to purchase kinerase	15
1	we really like this dish it allows soap and water to drain through you wo n't have the soap scum problem it looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it wo n't slide around on you	15
0	i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair will not purchase again	15
0	this product was a waste of good money it does n't even work to control frizz as promised the curls are limp and after about an hour or so there is a lot of frizz i would not buy this product again	15
0	the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all it gets a little cold but warms up in about 45 seconds i also noticed very little over all effects from using it	15
1	i have tried i think every product on the market nothing was helping my acne it just kept getting worse i still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this i loved it it did dry my skin out a little but whatever works ! my skin is clearer and smoother it just is n't perfect but who is	15
0	listen up ! ! ! l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1 7 ounce has the same moisturizing results for a fraction of the cost ! ! ! \)	15
1	i hsve used clinique moisturing gel for years and this was the first time i had the pump what a thrill as only a little bit is extracted and that is all one needs	15
1	i 've been using touche eclat ever since it came out i still love it cannot believe how rested i look after i put this on my dark circles are minimized i look radiant till now no other concealer can beat ysl 's touche eclat ca n't live without this product !	15
1	i decided to try it out and have found the only soap i want to use the fragrance is great it does not overpower i guess the milling process gives the soap it 's texture which removes the need for all those bath shower accessories and 1 bar lasted over 2 months i will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries	15
1	this is a really great smelling colonge really fragrent but not in your face strong i love to where this cologne before i go and do something really fun like going on a date or hanging with the guys cause i really think that this colonge is lucky there are plenty of times i was doing something mischevious and i swear i did n't get caught cause i was lucky \) get it \? i smells good and it is just like a rabbit foot with luck pick some up ! ! ! !	15
0	i have fairly sensative skin and can use most dior products but this product made my skin peel off of my face be very careful and test this first on your hand	15
1	i love this perfume it has been my signature everyday scent for several years now alot of people ask what you are wearing because it smells so good and guys love it too	15
0	this did n't do anything for me is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect \? i am returning it i'm really surprised others had such great results because i tried it twice and left it on for double the time and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream it does have more than baking soda and h2o2 also contains catalase some stearic acid and some vitamin c of course your skin already has its own catalase	15
1	i could n't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness but it 's fab for great feeling eyes the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk	15
1	i loveee this ring soo much it looks cute on my mdidle and index finger and the gloss is moisturizing with a touch of glitter all in one word glam ! !	15
0	i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i'm using aquamarina instead and love it though you ca n't get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i'm sure this wo n't happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead	15
1	i used to use mac 's glass lipgloss before juicy tubes were around any time the wind blew i had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which as you know is extremely unpleasant and annoying juicy tubes stays on but does n't have the overly sticky feeling which is wonderful i do n't wear much makeup and find juicy tubes to add that something special to a dewy face i recommend daiquiri or berry bold for the most natural looks daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while berry bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally you will adore this gloss i ca n't live without it	15
1	wonderfully light and clean scent ! both men and women have asked me what i was wearing hours after i thought the scent was gone it does not overpower when layering lotion and spray it 's a beautiful fragrance i love it	15
0	i ordered the fedora i am so dissapointed it came off within a few hours ! just peeled right off do not order this brand of fingernail polish it is the worst i have ever used	15
0	this hairspray was too wet and too stiff it ruined my clean freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker yuck ! ! ! ! i love the voluminizing shampoo conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam but when i lightly sprayed the finishing hair spray it ruined everything i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump sorry jonathan	15
1	great for after the gym great for winter dry skin love it ! ! !	15
0	this product works well when i use it with a curling iron the low rating is for the cost i just do n't think it is worth over 20	15
1	i 've been using strivectin sd for almost two years there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't get a complement on my skin i do n't wear any make up aside from lipstick my skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible i'm in the beauty business and i recommend this product to my customers i am not a spokesperson for the company only a happy and satisfied customer	15
1	i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth after a week the breakouts went away \( they were minor \) and all i can say is wow my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc etc i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products	15
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	15
1	i use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products having bleached hair i did n't think i 'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until i discovered these products they are worth their weight in gold ! they leave my hair soft manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful	15
1	philosophy products are very eye catching their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each i work with skin care products and do n't always believe what they claim there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply ca n't be done to someones skin this product however is pretty good it 's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here it cannot be good for sensitive skin i 'd recommend this to dry skin people only	15
1	my boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck and he was very skeptical about using this now he does n't get any ingrown hairs and he does n't pick at them anymore he will not live without it now and we both recommend it !	15
0	i had high hopes for this stuff i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves i have tried it on wet hair damp hair dry hair no discernable difference i will stick to my frederic fekkai products they actually work	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
1	this soap works well for sensitive skin smells like olive oil but hey that 's why they named it olive oil soap	15
1	beauty is hard work and savvy and so is this product you 'll find your fresh alluring face that 's been hiding since you were a young child	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
1	i did my christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown the package arrived before christmas i did not pay for gas for shopping i did not fight for a parking space and i did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize my mom 's favorite cologne was also at least 10 20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing this is the way to go	15
1	these are good and do the trick but it 's hard to get my fingers in the holes	15
1	i just love this product i felt like i was sitting on top of a cloud i definately am going to by this again	15
0	not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw even my own sylist said whatever you are using stop you hair feels very damaged it goes back to normal texture if i use my other shampoos i made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the jonathan shampoo and it was it went into the trash do n't purchase this stuff unless you 're going for the scarecrow look	15
1	this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp very light and smells great	15
1	this is the best micro peel i have ever tried ! the thing i noticed first was that when i applied when hope is not enough and the present they went on so smoothly they absorbed equally in my mid 30 's my young skin is fading but this really brought it back i wo n't say i am 19 again but i am sure the difference is obvious i am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since i added this to my bag of tricks it is a lot more effective that i would have thought and i have not had a microdermabrasion since i started using this 2 4 times per month	15
1	it is a very good conditioner it is light and yet conditioning but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish it smells distinctively barnyard but i see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me	15
1	this body butter is yummy it smells good it feels good on it is a must for dry skin	15
0	maybe i expect too much however even my lowest expectation wasnt met just go ask a dermatologist to help dont waste your money	15
0	i use the philosophy 3 in 1 with conditioner it works great and keeps my hair luscious the one time i accidentally bought a 3 in 1 that did n't have conditioner in it my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends after only three applications i had to throw the bottle out i lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair i do n't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality but they do this is one of their better scents however i would recommend using this as a body wash only	15
1	i love how this product works and feels on my skin ! ! does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out ! makes skin feel cool and clean ! ! i have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out or be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin but that was n't the case my skin did n't break out nor is this product drying highly recommend !	15
0	i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th ! ! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense \( 5 \) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible im very mad at lush com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap pissedoff	15
1	the resort we stayed at in fiji \( maravu on the island of taveuni also highly recommended \) used pure fiji products in their bures and i fell in love with this pineapple soap we showered outdoors and the smell and feel will always remind me of our honeymoon i brought some of this soap back in my luggage but it was lost somehow so i just had to buy some ! we did get some of the shampoo and conditioner samples which also smell wonderful ! mmmm	15
1	every home should have some ! there is no greater soap for beautiful scent gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper a perfect gift and a must in posh top notch hotels etc some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy	15
0	i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap but sadly that 's not what happened the smell is a very strong herbal like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish not very appealing ! there is some complexity to the scent but it 's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through on the plus side the color is beautiful \( a rich dark purple \) and the lather is equally lovely to look at if you like true herbal scents then you should give this a try it just was n't for me	15
1	its effect very much depends on the climate you live in if you live in a colder and dry climate especially during winter it does exactly as it promises great moisturizer lines are diminished as is puffiness i really love using it i am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate but in hot and sometims humid climates or during summer it just does n't work as well i do n't know why i like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle although i am using it as a seasonal eye care	15
0	you gotta love this woman 's moxy when the high life of being robert prayer requests in the dumpster tilton 's wife evaporated she picked herself right back up and developed a riff of her own selling worthless cosmetics always plenty of suckers to be found	15
1	i use the dusty pink and i have never ever used a blush that looks so natural and makes my skin glow so healthy with or without the mineral foundation from youngblood just lovely highly recommended	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	there is absolutely nothing special about this leave in conditioner besides the fact that it smells really good however i did n't see any changes in my daughter 's hair after using this conditioner none it is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly otherwise it will run down your face and neck \( wish it came with a spray pump instead \) i was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well known and has a lot of star celebrity power behind it however i found this conditioner to be all hype	15
1	i like this product but am not sure it is worth the money i have bought other products for 5 at my local store and i seem to have similar results	15
1	i love this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down i did get a good deal at my salon 9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner	15
1	i'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents the candy apple is definitely the most accurate and i 'd sell my soul if i could only continue buying it on its own but the other 2 are good too the cotton candy is awesome but not 100 on accuracy and the cherry sno cone makes me start slobbering when i smell it highly recommended	15
1	this is one of the most perfect concealers i have ever used it goes on nice and creamy \( does not pull on your skin when applying \) and covers those imperfections you also do not need a lot of product to get the job done the colors are very natural and i have found a perfect color in sand for me i will buy this product again	15
0	this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses this scent does n't linger and is too subtle not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil i do n't recommend this unless you are 16 and under i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it	15
0	i have very dry frizzy hair this treatment left my hair softer now my hair is a big soft frizz ball it added too much body i like this better for use as a grooming gloss	15
1	this product is fantastic ! i use it for my daughter who has very thick beautiful and coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it is not unmanageable and leaves it shiny and soft this works well with the hair balm ! !	15
1	i 've been using this product for a few years now and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather i once did a comparison between cortisone cream and dream cream and the dream cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did the scent is lavender herbal and very nice	15
1	i always buy this soap when i travel in france when i found it on amazon i was elated ! it is so moisturizing that i never need to use any body creams or lotions with its simple and pure properties of olive oil vegetable oil and mediterranean sea salted water savon de marseille is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin the large 1000gm blocks are a great value and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm bars great for ones' own personal use for gift giving the 300gm bars are perfect ! if you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream use this masterpiece soap	15
0	happy has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins it is like cheap colognes	15
1	it 's interesting to see all of the oil that this takes from your face it really shows on the paper and it does it 's job not as cheap as washing your face but more fun	15
1	like i stated in the title this is n't my favorite three in one product from philosophy i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet i would n't say it smells artifical but it does n't smell like fresh strawberries either i have used it as a shampoo conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it i have fine hair and it did n't leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about	15
0	works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips wouldnt buy it again	15
1	this is the only fragrance i have found that truly smells tropical this is my boyfriends favorite scent and he thinks all perfumes stink the four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry you have to wait awhile before you get dressed but it smells great	15
1	this product is the best my youngest daughter used it at my home and said she wanted the margarita then my oldest daughter said the same i like them both equally do follow the directions	15
1	worth every penny someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are the candles burn forever and really scent the place up but not in an ovepowering fake way i ca n't wait until they make body perfume in red currant all of them smell good however cheers from berkeley c	15
1	i have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping and this is it it 's absolutely amazing better than anything i have tried and i have tried so many lip products the lemon custard flavor is delicious too put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth this is the ultimate conditioner for your lips	15
1	this product works very well on my fair nordic and sensitive skin it covers well but with a light non oily feeling and combined with a fluff og powder it leaves my skin looking flawless i highly recommend this product	15
1	this lip gloss is so wonderful i do n't know where to start long lasting shine perfect color goes on smooth does n't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do mild fruity flavor i highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone the expense is worth it 100x over	15
1	an excellent pair of shears sharp and durable i expect them to last a long time	15
1	i really like this peel it is very easy to use and i have noticed a difference in my skin it is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading i even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing i recommend this peel to anyone i have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation i use this one about twice a week i also recommend the microdelivery vitamin c peel that one i use once a week jennife	15
1	i bought this after using other murad products and loving them i like this but i would n't say i love it first it 's a bit overpriced i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price the toner itself is decent but does n't seem to clean as deeply as other toners however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option non drying and does n't have that toner burn overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re purchase	15
0	this item does n't include everything that is mention in the details i would n't even pay a dollar for it don't purchase this item ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
1	i 've gotten a few compliments on it by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent moreso than the big bottles i bought the 50 one and i do like it but i think it 's gonna take me awhile to finish it so from now on i 'll buy the 1 7 oz first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent but overall very fresh and sweet smelling	15
0	i really wanted to like this i had heard so much about it and everyone seems to love it it smells like sunless tanning lotion on me i hate that smell does it smell like that to anyone else \? oh well i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it	15
1	go read the review i wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product cheaper at qvc then amazon like all the other 30 or so products i have shopped around for in the last 6 months go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at amazon ! ! !	15
0	after i ordered this product one of my co workers told me about the reviews on amazon i checked it out and i was really surprised ! the reviews are poor the worst part though is that the product is listed three times ! ! what 's the deal \? \? a product gets a bad review so they re list it more bad reviews and they re list it again ! see for yourself do a general search for hylexin and you will see several listings of the same product trying to out run bad reviews \? \? \? \? i now think less of the product and amazon shame on you both	15
1	i finally did what i should have done before all the black marks i bought a blackhead extractor which is face friendly tweezerman makes fine equipment i use a lot of their nail instruments \( i'm a licensed nail technician \)	15
0	if you buy this shampoo buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair i guarantee you will be disappointed it is the equivalent of herbal essence \( also leaves your hair like glue	15
1	i 've been using city lips for the past 6 months and i absolutely love it ! i especially love the moisturizing effect i used to have to use chapstick constantly but now i never use it my lips now are always soft and moisturized and fuller !	15
0	i have been using this product for about a month and all it 's done is given me puffy eyes there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles i 've used botox before and believe me botox works this product does n't so obviously it 's not better than botox i bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is	15
1	so i 've been wanting this particular fragrance for a long time now and my boyfriend finally purchased it for me for christmas it arrived on time with no problems and also came along with various perfume samples what can i say \? it was exactly i expected to be no disappointments	15
0	jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you ca n't fool them twice i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two	15
1	i 've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles but the scent fades rather quickly if the scent lasted longer it would be much improved	15
0	at 23 i do n't have age wrinkles around my eyes but i have laugh lines that i want to soften this product has done nothing for my laugh lines i could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines this product did not	15
0	i received this as a gift i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since i only got to use it three times	15
0	i have to agree with another reviewer this product is not worth the price tag it claims to have a vanilla scent and it does but it is barely noticible do n't buy this product based on how it smells as a moisturizer you can do much better for 23 00	15
1	i may be the only woman alive who does n't like happy but i love heart ! it 's a perfect fragrance not too strong but not too light it 's very feminine	15
0	i have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin leaving burn marks for weeks ! finally i went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal please check with your doctor first before trying this	15
0	it does n't work for what we intended it for blackhead removal my teen son was really hoping this would help him and it did n't not only that but the safety cap for the lance end does n't stay on	15
1	i tried the lemon sugar perfume and i am absolutly in love with it it is like no other perfume i have ever smelled before i will probably be using it the rest of my life i hope they never stop making it i think everyone should try it the scent is lemony and sugar just like it says it is light and last a very long time i am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow do not just take my world for it order it today and experience something great and new	15
1	works exceptionally well dont use water just place 10 15 drops into bowl and like a tea candle creates warm and relaxing aromas	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
1	i am seeing results after three weeks i love this stuff	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
1	i have the beginnings of crow 's feet the essential c eye cream has helped to decrease the lines and restored the elasticity and suppleness of the delicate skin around my eyes	15
1	this is a very rich creme i find it works best for me if i use it all over my face once or twice a week my face breaks out if i use it more often i am 63 years old so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes but in that case i would recommend the strivectin sd eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance	15
1	i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it 's ust glittery but i love i	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
1	this product is great ! i had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when i could not take the strecth marks the itching the pain the red skin i used it and it was like magic three days of use and i am a new person with soooo much better skin getting better everyday	15
0	i tried doing a patti labelle do where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it	15
1	terrific for the area around the eyes gets rid of dryness and does n't sting the eyes or feel greasy	15
1	this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright shiny hair for me i have nice hair to begin with \( if i do say so myself \) but i used this in conjunction with one of lush 's conditioners \( american cream \) and my friends told me i had shampoo model hair that day i'm not crazy about the beer ish smell which is why i 'll give it a four rating however it does n't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it	15
1	i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites it 's a pretty good deal at only 28 for so many colors i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket it 's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar themed cosmetic experience	15
0	like many others my perfume turned yellow as well i think it only happens with the atomizer perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf life i am never buying perfume from britney spears obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume	15
0	my fiance' left this bottle of prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it it was empty ! ! ! seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer \( pump sprayer \) and then it all leaked out and down the bottle glueing itself to the jewelry box now we have an empty bottle of prada and a ruined finish on the top of the jewelry box i have sent sephora an email explaining what had happened but have not heard back from them beware of where you keep this bottle ! ! !	15
0	this soap washed really well but after i rinsed it off it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it it also made my skin feel stipped i did not really like this soap and instead recommend basis facial products instead	15
0	i was excited to try out this product given all the rave reviews but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash ! it 's awful ! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination i would not recommend this product	15
1	i do n't remember when i first tried this product but now i 've been using it for years and i love it ! this is a great eye color base it goes on smoothly without rubbing or pulling the skin and provides a smooth base for powder eye color i wear it every day under my eye makeup it makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you 're wearing try it and you 'll love it too	15
0	this is a hit or miss product i ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating \( burnt coffee caramel cigarettes \) the product did work for a while my extremely dry curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working i would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut jojoba almond avocado before shampooing or after i adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier if you do want to try the product ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
1	reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to especially if you 're not already using lush products it does n't 'sud up' much and feels a little bit muddy and grainy do n't fret though ! it will certainly clean your hair and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices \( almost as good as arabian bright \) the highlights are not something that come with one or two washings but with many many washings and they are very subtle but there the only reason i do n't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is and i needed to use another conditioning product with it	15
1	tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers i 've ever purchased they stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise quick and virtually painless and when they do go dull all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so they arrive back good as new you ca n't beat that !	15
1	moisturize and refresh yourself as you relax in this foamy bath your stress will soak away and you 'll feel truly happy	15
1	soft sensual made me feel feminine and attractive my husand agrees	15
1	this product is amazing ! i have very dry skin and this just soaks in leaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days i even have used it for my shampoo times with good results there too	15
1	this is awesome for thick curly hair apply when wet and it absorbs and keeps you moisturized for days also good with shea butter to 'slick smooth' edges for a ponytail	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
1	i am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time i would order it again	15
0	i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning tend skin helps for that ! just take a strong whiff and you 'll be alert and ready for your day !	15
0	i love clinique products in general but i do n't like the soap in the liquid form it has a strong chemical smell to it and i find myself holding my breath while washing my face i much prefer the bar soap and would n't buy the liquid again for all that it seemed much more convenient no complaints on cleaning ability	15
0	i bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work well it does n't i followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever i'm 24 23 when i tried the product no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all if it does n't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff i wish i had n't listened to the raves on this product	15
0	i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product i opened this bottle expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected ! when i read that it smelled the nesquick i thought i 'd like it anyway because i love strawberry nesquick but this stuff smells like well i ca n't describe it all i know is i wish i had n't paid 16 for it live and learn i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel smells better off topic why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3 in 1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel \? would n't they smell just the same	15
1	i love jonathan products and especially how it makes my hairfeel so soft and sexy looking keep up the good work jonathan	15
1	i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho hum scent this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product	15
1	this is my favorite soap in the world a new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks and the scent lingers on my skin as well the soap is gentle and long lasting i recommend it highly	15
1	its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire i like the sting and the shine of it it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it 's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong did i mention the great smell \? yum ! me and my boyfriend loved it	15
0	i 've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles and yes it does burn ! the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere i 've had dark under eye circles all my life i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money i will not be wasting my money on this product again	15
0	i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality perhaps worth the price to some but i 'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness most ionic and infrared is gibberish tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties \( when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal \) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else i 'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	this powder provides excellent coverage without being thick \( thick powder base is horrible it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour \) my freckles are still there but my skintone is more even it did its job of concealer very well no red spots no dark circles and it works very well as a foundation powder much better than any other powder foundation i 've ever used come to think of it much better than any liquid foundation i 've ever used	15
1	obviously some people do n't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that does n't deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it would n't be the bestselling perfume right now but do n't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better	15
0	i normally like warm sensual type perfumes but i wanted to try something different for a change i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey well i have to disagree i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all to me it has a very sharp high toned scent which is almost acrid i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on so i tried just a little spritz still very strong and sharp and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets i will definitely not be ordering this again	15
1	this is a great idea for a product ! for those of you who do n't wash your hair every day this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you do n't wash it i used this after 5 days without washing and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful ! well done	15
0	i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it well it was good at first and then i got tired it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine i sometiems use it but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits \( that 's what i use it for \) i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long	15
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	15
0	i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids i was really bummed out try the cinnamon buns it is so much better	15
0	i 've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much but when i got around to actually smell it i was so dissapointed i can only smell an old lady perfume a bug spray i do n't know something so strong and not strong in the right way my favourites are dior j'adore red delicious intuition \( estee lauder \) try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful	15
0	i have to write in caps because i am so irritated i have tried 5 different carol's hair products and none including this one has worked not only that the smells aren't all that great and they scream it's like people who wear bad perfume that's extremely strong but smells horrible they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	15
0	not what i expected ! this shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair it has no conditioning whatsoever i used the jungle conditioner after the shampoo it is equally hopeless ! it is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of india ! a waste of money a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype	15
1	but it definitally did not work as it was intended it is intended to moisturize hair i have long fine oily hair and i received trichomania as a gift i love the smell but when i first used it it left my hair very dry which i consider a good thing considering the state of my hair it just didnt do what it was supposed to however if you have really oily hair this is the thing for you no problems with lathering either especally if you rub the bar in your hair not in your hands doesnt leave white flakes either	15
0	i like the philosophy line but the vanilla birthday cake body wash does n't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas the product is great though	15
0	ok so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i 've tried and felt the need to write a review on i have to say this product is far below expectations i sprayed in on and the only thing you smell is the alcohol there seems to be no other notes to it even after you let it settle all you can pick up is alcohol definitely not recommending this product	15
0	i have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of british comedy once you get past the numerous jokes about mrs slocum 's cat and a flaming mr humphreys you have very little left to justify it 's long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time in retrospect it is lacking many will disagree with me but that 's life	16
1	i watched 7 out of 8 episodes in two days it may be educational for people who did n't know much about it but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics this documentary film did n't offer much more	16
0	this dvd covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds ! it does not give enough body to the addition explanation and is hard to follow it was a pure waste of money	16
1	i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv but i know i have no qualms with the dvd i have bought all the series thus far it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan	16
0	note that in my previous review in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer i was only referring to the quot that touch of mink quot dvd the father goose dvd is not that bad	16
1	the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie \? about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick	16
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	16
0	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful	16
1	this is a great show and very entertaining the story is n't the greek classic but it 's a fine riff on it the songs are good and they grow on you as you watch i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character it 's just a cartoon for pete 's sake like some other reviewers i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing go the distance over the end credits but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version no importa la distancia sung by ricky martin and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money	16
0	p sele una estrella como calificaci n s lo para poder respaldar a quienes ya han opinado pues se trata de un bodrio de pel cula yo felizmente s lo la arrend de lo contrario la p rdida de dinero habr a sido mucho mayor	16
0	who would give the green light to this \? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one	16
1	if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and does n't do bad at all at the acting thing	16
1	i love the simpsons ! although the early seasons are classic they seem to get better and more funny as they go on this season includes the episode where milhouse 's parents get divorced which is hilarious and the one where homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out ! definitely worth the purchase there are a lot of extras too	16
0	i was just using this tape and ended it half way through to write a review the cueing stinks and is frustrating i am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using firm tapes on and off for about 15 years this one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is so frustrating you want a work out where you actually work not waste your time trying to read the instructor 's mind and falling all over the bench !	16
0	this was a piece of junk trust me dont buy it ! ! biggestt disapointment ever ! if a dumb company will make a dvd of this trash why cant they make one for howard the duck \?	16
0	unable to view because of incompatible format \( as you warned me ! \) however my ancestor james mclintock of barnsley yorkshire england sent john wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film \( which is why i wanted the dvd \) so	16
1	this movie was both entertaining and at times hilarious charlie sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist denise richards is funny as his ditzy shallow girlfriend and angie harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper also jon lovitz is hysterical as sheen 's plastic surgeon best friend this movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor i highly recommend it	16
0	i would love to review this lions gate dvd but i ca n't catch one word in ten it is not as advertised closed captioned and the characters' speech is too casual and british for me to get drat ! i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version	16
1	this movie is a reallllllllllllly scary movie the only part i did n't like was that pervert mikks in the beginning be warned of grossness that is all i need to say	16
0	this is not a good film i wanted to like it because i love south park and i think that trey parker and matt stone are comedic geniuses while it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance overall it 's just not very funny i think i laughed twice during the whole film watch it to see the south park guys before they were stars but do n't expect much	16
1	they do't make musicals like this anymore well they do n't really make musicals anymore do they \? they used to make them made them well and they came out like down argentine way the plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright costumes lavish and not a few laughts the major players betty grable and don ameche are as engaging as usual carmen miranda makes her us film debut and sings dances and mispronounces her way to stardom the 20th century fox role players appear \( charlotte greenwood j carrol naish henry stephenson \) and add to the fun	16
0	even though tsui hark is one of my favorite hong kong directors this movie did not at all show his skill the story was poor along with the actors performances i may be a little biased since i love john woo and tsui hark killed their friendship by making this movie worth checking out but i would'nt buy it if i were you	16
0	there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story \( in both regards \) have to do with the story as a whole \? nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin	16
1	i ca n't wait to all the seasons of dallas are available	16
1	my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i did n't care for the commercial either	16
1	in this cynical day and age it 's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant \( not to mention amazing \) but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage \? this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls' early years and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea it 's all things to all people but it 's never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it 's a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings	16
0	i was trying to watch it but can not open de dvd because it is the wrong country code \? \? \? \?	16
0	reference picture quality on hd dvd basically unwatchable though i would not recommend the blind buy on this one	16
0	one of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie low budget unispired performances \( alexis denisof is particularly bad here \) lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon bad direction despisable characters cliched situations how kinski chose to act in this one \?	16
0	i watched this movie not because i am into ms milano or her breasts but because it was shot \( sadly \) at my high school shattuck st mary 's school in faribault mn does n't say much for the school or for the faculty who had bit parts in it	16
1	this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals so if you 're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view five on the black hand side and breathe in the culture	16
0	the transfer is real real bad the story is also weird but its o	16
0	maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie did n't take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor	16
0	i gave one star beacuse it is not color this very old movies i want some in color about depression i have the prombleof the derpression of you have any movies about this please let me kno	16
1	great improvements over the original dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2 35 1 widescreen ratio the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of approximately 2 35 1 which was not true i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price this plays very well on my hdtv monitor i 'll give the old version to someone w an old 4x3 tv	16
1	we have all of the series that have been released so far and enjoy them all this was one great show !	16
0	i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck ! \) and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better	16
0	not a good script kind of slow a regular movie if you are into history in america but if you dont live there or got any interest in this particular plot i wont recomended is borin	16
0	after seeing match point which i loved i figured i had to see scoop all i can say is oh my gawd ! scoop is perhaps the worst movie i 've ever seen woody allen really should stay out of his own movies and the rest of it the story acting editing etc were just painful to watch i ca n't believe he went from match point to this dribble	16
1	this is definately worth the price i cried and laughed watching the perfect story of chi and hedeki beautiful animation great story line	16
1	i 've seen it about 20 times now it does n't get old the faces the moves and the lines of matthew perry are always fresh my husband likes selma a lot so it 's a win win for both of us they are great together good stuff	16
1	i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	16
1	notice to parents there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones adult nature a woman grows to 50 ft placing an extra strain on a strained marriage daryl hanna and daniel baldwin this is a light monster film not gory it is good for that it carries some laughs punny stuff and summer flick character no deep story folks	16
1	simply the most entertaining mockumentary film i 've seen in years and one of the best ever the dvd is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you 'd expect jenna fischer is brilliant and james gunn is hilarious you just have to buy it to understand	16
0	i was purchasing rockin' wheels \( the one with the train and fire truck \) for my son and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together we borrowed the rockin' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much i thought it would be good to have two different ones however the truck adventures is not as good and my son does n't even ask to watch it the songs are lame and so is the narrator do n't bother	16
1	excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an f b i agent under deep cover to infiltrate japenese mob greatperformances by all michael nouri a little over the top great action and sentimentality when viggos character is tornbetween man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent afterf b i makes deal with mobster nouri to make a hit on the yakuza	16
0	the alpha version of postal inspector is of very poor video quality otherwise it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was bela 's last film under his original universal contract the stock footage of the flood is spectacular	16
1	my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she 's adopted max as an imaginary younger brother there 's no flash and no dash no special effects and no tired slapstick but there is charm gentleness intelligence humor and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward and she 's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it ages 18 months through five five stars and then some	16
0	this complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone star movie with cringingly awful acting laughable special effects \( the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment \) appalling dubbed dialogue cheesy music inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere the grim reaper is a total disaster do n't waste your money on this turkey	16
1	this is my favorite movie i like it all screenplay director actors etc believe it brilliant	16
1	love this movie ! ca n't decide which version i like better this one or the one with grace kelly and bing crosby ! both are great	16
0	ah um well my brother picked this up not too long ago and well it sucks ! it 's the worst of the whole series ! i thought it would have to do with the mask michael wears in the others but not a ficken thing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital but then i took one because of how bad the rest was	16
1	this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	16
1	this is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is seriously flawed tom hanks and shelly long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this	16
0	i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it	16
1	most people that like wes anderson 's films are rabid fanatics and i'm no exception so when the chance came to buy his first feature length film for 7 i snapped it up if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums you 'll enjoy this on some levels too many of anderson 's classy touches are already in evidence in this film the story is fun and the characters are well developed yeah pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson 's character masterfully done even in his first role	16
0	its probably alright if you like stuff like this but i dont	16
1	i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that 's exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would 've moved along at a better pace but still a great movie	16
1	i found this movie delightful from the storyline directing and photography to the actors ! i especially loved the performances of timothy bottoms and chloris leachman ! it 's an enlightening movie that makes an important point sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all	16
1	if you liked yul brynner in quot the magnificent seven quot you will love him in this movie brynner is cool as they come this is a great western and should be on dvd	16
1	i enjoyed watching queen latifah in a more mature acting but the picture quality of the dvd that i bought was terrible \( thanx to amazon \) to my surprise all the trailers quality were superb but the movie was terrible terrible and terrible to be honest the quality of the picture spoilt the fun side of the movie but still i say big ups to queen \( uyisikhokho ntombazana \) i had to use this platform although its of irrelevancy to comment about the movie format enjoy everyday like its your last	16
1	i loved the book and i feel that this movie did it justice the actresses are new favorites of mine and i feel they really captured the spirit of the characters the movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century england just as the book does i would definately recommend this movie and the book	16
0	remember seagal 's movie patriot where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane that was bad this one was by far the worst movie he has ever made with the dubbed in voice \( why \? \) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released	16
0	i cannot believe this is billed as a baby video the images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value i personally like the baby miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby	16
1	she really brings a character to life and this short series of british comedy was really enjoyable	16
0	she is a little poser ! ! ! kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies wearing that stupid little diaper always so happy she wo n't be so happy when i kick her between the legs also those stupid little cowboy boots she really sucks i 'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry that shown her ! ! ! the movie was good but she stinks	16
1	the musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when i saw it for the first time my husband is no square and he enjoyed it all seniors would love to see it again the film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd	16
1	this is a great collection i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy but my son is hooked on it now too	16
1	this dvd 'd ok it has the original program in it and some new features although i was a bit dissapointed as the new features only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters and the t mac ending goes for like 5 mins and the quality isnt that great	16
1	as a kid living in iran this movie was my favorite though it is an old one	16
0	this is the first and only dvds i will buy from this company this could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy i learned absolutely nothing and the women were disgusting trust me do not buy this dvd if your life depends on it	16
0	the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)	16
1	this movie is pure fun my whole family loved it it 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour but its fun to watch we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing watch it and enjoy	16
0	this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen \? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town \? i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie	16
0	belushi 's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite monty python 's michael palin as the manly captain ned in the miles cowperthwaite skits they are both absent from this dvd nor on any snl video i can find	16
0	as some of the other reviewers have mentioned this us release has replaced the original source music but the region 2 version has been released without these cuts so for everyone with a multiregion player i 'd suggest using amazon co uk to buy a copy there instead	16
0	this dvd is not shaolin idiot but an older film of stephen chow it 's really a film called look out officer that stephen chow made in 1990 shaolin idiot is not out yet to my knowledge if you want stephen chow 's look out officer you should buy this dvd if not do n't	16
1	this movie is really cute fluffy and not too deep but really funny meg ryan is in rare form i love the scene at the sidewalk cafe	16
0	recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad all this without any systematic mathematics hurrah for the chinese alas like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared somewhere either burnt or submerged in tar but speculation continues meanwhile spaghetti was invented there without which no italy would have arisen oh and crackers they invented crackers and bed posts first	16
0	this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it	16
0	ok i'm a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened \? did they run out of money \? did the writer write himself into a corner \? there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you	16
1	simply the most classic surf video ever ! certainly a must have for any respectful surfe	16
1	this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old	16
0	this scooby doo vhs is absoulty horrible ! ! it lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the scooby doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like plus its higher cost i paid 9 95 trust me buy scooby doo 2 or scooby doo cyber chase those keep the kids glued to the t v very exciting just the way we want scooby doo to be ! !	16
1	i was so pleased to find this movie on amazon com i had watched it as a child and pinned over it when i could not find it in stores over the years this is such a pure love story with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real there are too few unpretentious untampered romantic movies around these days most reveal too much literally but this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	16
0	avril 's music is ok but i hate this dvd she 's trying to be gothic or whatever and it does n't work it looks like she shopped at hot topic or something avril quit being goth ! you have no reason too ! and you are n't gothic therefore get singing lessons and make a cd because girl sorry you ca n't sing but yeah avril plays the guitar so it 's ok but 1 star for this goth imitation dvd	16
0	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to quot act quot in this film after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch do anything you can to get out of sitting through this	16
0	i do n't like her routine in this dvd at all i do n't like the strechie it 's a completely waste and it wo n't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball i solde the dvd the 2nd day i bought it however i do like her 'shrink your female fat zone ' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body lower body and abs	16
1	for being such a perky story with some steamy scenes this film rescues the genre of erotic comedy films	16
0	i would love to provide a review of this dvd however since i 've not received it despite having placed my order in august \( it 's now november \) and having written to amazon customer service about the matter \( as yet unanswered \) i'm afraid any review will have to wait	16
1	when i read the reviews i thought that maybe i should n't see the movie but i was desperate to rent it since dmx was in it when i finished watching the movie i thought that the people were full of crap this movie was a great example of real life and it had a very good touching end	16
1	if you want to see lena heady 's breasts exposed this is the film to watch but besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes \( which are n't too bad \) this film is very intriguing the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction frustration and isolation now is n't that what a suspense drama should be about	16
0	the presentation of computer enhanced b w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library legacy of my father however the aural commentary of brannagh was repetitive and boring each episode basically repeated the same 6 octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections	16
1	i found i did enjoy this movie even though the director took liberties it does n't follow so much the novel by jane austen but if you have n't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons this movie is enjoyable i gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director but did like what i saw	16
0	when we tried to play the item on our dvd player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it we ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer which worked properly i am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded i can see deducting shipping and handling but a restocking charge that is outrageous ! the merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it ! please remind me not to buy from amazon com	16
0	this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin	16
0	i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police aspect and less on the science which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle	16
0	warning ! this video has no captioning i 've rented it and it does not have captioning it is useless to me and fellow deaf and hard of hearing folk	16
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	16
0	if there is one thing michael bay is good at it 's explosions big 'ol explosions there are a lot of them in this film along with a painful to watch romantic scene involving animal crackers this is a film that ben affleck billy bob thornton \( both in the film \) admit to being ashamed of pure leave your brain at the door entertainment	16
1	i really enjoyed this movie not the typical john boy movie i have not seen the original although i have recently purchased it i will be able to make a better comparison once i have seen it by itself however it holds it 's own	16
0	when i first got this disc the other day it would not play at all i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive and it played however it does not play well at all the video is constantly dragging or skipping the audio is fine though i ca n't really provide a review of the content since so far it is unwatchable this is the only disc that has given me issues	16
1	the movie is excellent i was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage but the regular dvd is excellent as well not many additional features but the movie is delightful and although slightly longer then some holds the viewers interest minor amounts of nudity some very graphic fist fighting but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot one of ron howard 's best films	16
1	an absolute must have for all parents families and professionals ! as a speech amp language pathologist i have worked with special needs children for 17 years and finally i have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with down syndrome informative comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent dvd i would highly recommend it for not only families but for all professionals working with this population in fact i believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children thanks for a great product	16
1	all the great reviews written previously say it all anne of green gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel i 've been watching this movie since i 've been a child and i still watch it as an adult a movie like this does n't need special features for it to be attractive as a dvd \( although the commentary is great ! \) just the fact that no matter how long i keep this and how often i watch this movie it wo n't change like vhs does	16
1	a movie to enjoy watching many times very entertaining and light	16
0	i purchased dick cavett 's john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett 's interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best	16
1	i have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv i had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and i have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out the gradual awakening of young ta to which girl is truly right for him and sammy fong 's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts the ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from james shigeta to a professional dancer afterall it 's the music and the story that make this great	16

1	the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a well paced and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen	16
0	i agree with everyone that wants old nick i remember putting on the tv and watching legends of the hidden temple guts are you afraid of the dark \? and so on put them on dvd people would surely buy it	16
0	as someone said in an earlier review the movie is split up into two parts the first part training camp was good i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam after that i found it unwatchable the main character is so annoying i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast if you 're looking for a good war movie look elsewhere	16
1	i was thrilled to find this set here on amazon and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly all of the dvd 's have some good interviews with the producers designers voice actors and other people associated with the show i do n't usually like watching interviews things where people talk a lot but i love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was i totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different	16
0	stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes' and steven seagal 's they are brain dead movies with brain dead screenplays bad directors bad everythings this movie like other viewers' said drove me nuts i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys' movies otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration amazon com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie god help us	16
0	my objection was the implication that the stars played a part in the film i felt that the picture was completely deceptive ms richards and ms hanna had less than 15 minutes \( maybe a little more but not much and possible even less \) and were clearly there to fool the viewer it was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary	16
0	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
1	the movies of course are dated but fascinating also the picture quality was excellent as was the sound the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed now even the simplest movie regardless of the subject has an edge these horror movies of the 40s 50s are gentler less scary with a clear statement of good and evil now we view things differently without any absolute judgments clarity has given way to a more unsettled world	16
0	i take this title form the video store thinking in wynton marsalis when i was watching the dvd i can appreciate that the image is very good \( not great and i have a 720p tube tv \) and the sound is very good also \( not great i have a reference equipment \) but the show is so boring look you just desire this man stop to blow the drum 's solo is just awesome but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	16
0	if shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play othello he would remove heaven and earth crying out for justice be an actor in a play of shakespeare it 's difficult and only the best ones can do it not mediocre actors with face of children what 's martin sheen doing here \? he should be in better movies and in this trash if you want a good othello adaptation get the movie with kenneth brannag and laurence fishburne are good actors and a better movie	16
0	while i absolutely love the show on pbs this season was mispackaged the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1 2 unfortunately i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it if you buy this be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series	16
1	my 2 yr old son has watched this dvd again and again he 's not into cartoons so the real life airplanes trains and buses suit him perfectly	16
1	this is the all time great original classic the remake is okat best add this to your classic movie collection highly recommended	16
1	the wolf man legacy set a no brainer like all the classic universal legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone jack pierce 's make up and wolfman creation are still the best ! this set along with dracula and frankenstein legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with you still need abbott and costello meets frankenstein to truely complete the series	16
0	this pilot is so bad the acting the writing the directing the costumes it 's a miracle that b5 ever got even one season approved by the suits at least they could have gotten decent actors pretty much every character on this pilot is represented by a piss poor actor and the writing is grade school \( i think this is what real people do \) tripe horrible rotten useless junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
1	this is one of the best semi futuristic movie ever and for all you shadowrun lovers out there this movie has the same type of erie ness and finess to it by far keanu reeves' best performance to date	16
0	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then	16

1	panic room is a great thriller jodie foster 's return to the big screen i 'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself however the real treat in the 3 disc special edition is the behind the scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture	16
0	there are way to many lesbians still killing themselves because of the stresses of being a lesbian it 's not even mildly acceptable that there are still more suicide as an option self victimization films that are being praised and sold to us	16
1	the bbc created the perfect cast in this terrific film watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today it is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets the latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the bbc version highly recommend to those who love jane austin and her works	16
0	the only good thing on this dvd are the interview segments with gidget gein this was the most boring dvd i have ever watched and i actually started to fall asleep the first time i attempted to watch it	16
1	the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period there 's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done doris and perry como 's duet together was ok \( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him \) doris day has always been under rated as a singer her voice is sheer perfection it 's too bad that doris did n't do more specials or have a variety comedy musical show like carol burnett	16
0	what 's wrong with this show \? 1 jim wears the same pants coat and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series 2 a slow sluggish middle aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums 3 wo n't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her \? 4 do you really believe that this middle aged heavy fellow would drive a firebird a tight fitting car \? 5 angel ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
0	i bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves when we received it we found out it was a blu ray edition and our dvd player does n't accept blu ray dvd 's so i basically bought a movie i ca n't watch it should have been put in the description that this a blu ray edition for those of us who do n't have blu ray compatible dvd players	16
1	great movie ! delivery of the order came in good time this 2 disc collector 's edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions	16
0	this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portrayingthe gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping yahushua jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand the so called scholarly comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tearit down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rddvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on	16
0	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	16
1	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes plus an extra un aired episode the show was not only far ahead of its time but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies this dvd is a must	16
0	this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining	16
1	the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood eric fleming was mindblowing one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of him todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western yes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood	16
0	i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i 've seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it did n't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it	16
0	better than submerged but that 's not saying much my wife and i have seen almost all of stevies movies and next to the foreigner and submerged this movie ranks up there in the horrid category what is up with the voice dubbed over when stevie was mumbling we kept trying to guess whose voice that was \( burgess meredith the guy who played the other terminator on t2 etc \) that was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film i ca n't see why blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe maybe there are more of us die hard ss fans than i realized even so save your money do not buy rent steal vie	16
1	this movie is great ! very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud love it	16
1	my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter ca n't get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it	16
1	spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows constructive insightful inspirational educational and entertaining these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days ! should be emmy nominated it 's that good brilliant	16
0	this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time it 's unauthorized by muse so therefore there were no interviews no live footage and none of their music was included they interviewed people who had never even met the band i learned nothing new from watching it do n't waste your money	16
1	as if this set could be anything but five stars ! ! ! barbra streisand four of her films on their dvd debut her own commentary oy vey ! order it now and plan a vacation day for the day after you get delivery	16
0	george clooney is about as entertaining to watch as michael jackson being raped by the gorton 's fisherman his pompous self indulgent personality is better suited for being a walmart greeter except he 'd probably be fired for only saying hello to himself clooney get los	16
1	having only seen seinfeld 's series on tv that goes by the same name it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on dvd i 'd never seen the dvd before but some of the material sounded familiar perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the seinfeld show \? you may notice that in his speel about the chinese he lets the word shovel out too soon \( when talking about the chinese 's perseverance with chopsticks \) and thus spoils the joke a little bit but seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib so he managed to work around it a thoroughly recommendable dvd	16
1	i have watched this film on my local pbs station at least 1 2 dozen times because it is soooooo good i have a mental vacation each time i find that my stress just goes away while watching this awe inspiring movie i highly recommend this film for the whole family	16
0	the quot latin quot moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves but if you 're interested in latin dance my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead this workout just is n't as energetic and fast paced as it looks	16
0	i love cinderella and try to see them live whenever they 're in town but the sound on this dvd is just horrible did n't anyone listen to it before releasing it \? the video quality is fair they sure did n't spend a lot of money on production here i was very disappointed and wish i could get my money back	16
0	i agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter however the couple of minutes where rory block sings quot if i had possession over judgement day quot are worth the entire price of this dvd do n't buy the tape 'cos you 'll have to sit through so much stuff you wo n't make it but on the dvd you can go straight to rory block and never watch the rest	16
1	pro great story teriffic acting beautiful settingcon some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the wholelindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character 's lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film	16
0	this joe d'amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze bordering on pornography the plot or lack thereof is typical woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption to make the film last 80 minutes joe d'amato fills the story with lesbianism vile tortures naked women in rat infested sewers and plenty of gratuitous sex i gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore	16
1	this movie was much better than vanilla sky vanilla sky mostly copied open your eyes but was too obvious and less convincing \( and tom cruise though good in some roles did n't fit this role well \) open your eyes takes a little longer to draw you in but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where vanilla sky does also the jungian dream aspect in vanilla sky is poorly done whereas open your eyes represents the dream experience very well i recommend watching both movies before you buy one but if you 're going to buy get open your eyes	16
1	i 'll make this short and sweet this is by far the best bond movie of them all imho excellent work by connery and the rest of the cast	16
0	nothing original here nothing overly humourous overall pretty bland in my opinion the only part i thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end	16
1	a night out with the backstreet boys was a romantic dvd each of the five guys gets their own solo turns it also includes songs that are never heard by any bsb fans it 's definitely a great dvd a must buy for every bsb lover ! go grab one for yourself if you have n't yet !	16
1	the best cleopatra that the movies has ever produced be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part so many came before and so many after elizabeth taylor however to me cleopatra will always be elizabeth taylor a mega movie with fantastic costumes and acting is a classic in historic movies if you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection	16
1	mathau and lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like grumpy old men the plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship	16
0	this is nothing but a huge dissapointment there 's almost nothing on this video about baseball if there was a rating lower than zero stars i would give it that rating	16
1	i would recommend this mel brooks movie if you 're in the mood to see slapstick comedy with many popular comedic faces you 'll come away repeating some of the catch phrases and dialog i first saw it when it came out and still laugh when i see it mel brooks is a genius	16
0	i love pablo 's act on comedy central this one does n't even touch it	16
1	i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film 's power as a period piece but it totally did n't it was seamless i will buy this for my home collection i have always loved kirsten dundst 's work and this is no exception	16
0	i was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year a third of a way through it it starting to skip and freeze i played it all the way through but took forever at the ending it was workinhg again but i missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage i guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used wo n't be doing this again !	16
0	18th century opera dressed in 20th century clothe not my cup of tea	16
1	this is a great movie especially if you like quot dancehall queen quot paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching	16
1	i love death cab i saw on degrassi when an interviewer asks ashley and craig \( in the interview that they leeave spinner and marco out of \) they say that they are influenced by dcfc i started watching degrassi when i heard kevin smith was on 3 episodes get this dvd it is sooooooo good i want plans too	16
1	this is a must own film ! i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end daniel berhardt is god	16
1	this movie is an action mystery space love story with a lot of interesting charecters and you really get into it there is little swearing and half a second of nudity which does n't show anything but somebodies backside i would recomend this movie the ending is a surprise and there is cool plot twists	16
1	the performance given by poitier will not dissappoint this movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother lena this work is timeless	16
0	maybe this is not fair to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews and i am not buying this dvd as swamp fox is incomplete ! three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase	16
0	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after \? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i would n't	16
1	i'm not usually a ballet person i have n't seen anything since the nutcracker when i was six but this was absolutely brilliant the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop \? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet	16
1	timeless classic movie 2 of the songs are frequently re done by various artist	16
1	i have been waiting for this dvd to come out for a very long time ! it is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the bradley war tank it shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used even if they were not acceptable for use and the struggle of one man to do the right thing you will not stop laughing while watching this movie !	16
0	i discarded the dvd after watching it if you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home do n't buy this version of the secret garden	16
0	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry ! !	16
0	avoid this cheapo release of these great film ! subpar prints certainly not from original 35mm elements wait for the good one to come out down the road	16
0	this was not the entire version of the hbo special i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it	16
0	the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution	16
1	with king creole love me tender and stay away joe jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look especially how the choreography should be executed in this film we see elvis presley at his very best he was a stunning actor much more prefer him to james dean it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best it isn`t a classic it isn`t even great but we have elvis the king and that`s the best there is \) \)	16
0	this movie is so dumb that it 's as good with the sound off as with the sound on the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script but this script has no charm no wit no nothing	16
0	i was fortunate to be able to see a live preformance in my home town about 12 years ago i do n't beleive that this effort is up to par	16
1	an awesome film with some suspense and raunchiness all rolled in to one	16
1	this movie was one of the most honest accurate portrayals of how to play the dating game i have ever seen i liked it so much i bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers ignore the tacked on hollywood ending	16
0	p s has potential both grace and linney are great in it but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring it 's a shame because it could 've been a great movie great acting with a bland plot	16
1	this dvd is awesome the only problem i have with it is its too short only 4 episodes	16
1	you gotta get the whole series you ca n't just get one or two dvds you need the whole thing trust me once you start you gotta go all the way to the end	16
1	this is a great dvd collection of a great show i hope that they follow up this set and the christmas set with another 3 disc set of shows as great as this set is it just left me wanting more i hope they deliver there are still many many classic episodes left to be seen it was worth every penny	16
0	this has a run down of the colts season from game one to the super bowl thats it do not expect the super bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is very disappointing the afc championship game of the week is just a post game show i would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game it was better then the super bowl the only good things where the few extras with manning and harrison wired for sound i hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much	16
1	this movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made you will laugh all the way thru it and enjoy when things were so much simplier in hollywood	16
1	i ca n't wait to see the original film again i remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea thus was born the inspiration for the great pc game lemmings yes i know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide nevertheless i love this movie i hope that they do n't cut the lemming sequence disney has promised a full restoration other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an arctic blizzard the hardships of an arctic existence were beautifully photographed	16
0	never even seen tony jaa till the end ! ! ! save your money on this film it's not worth it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
1	we enjoyed this video the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting somehow these tough big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to sporn	16
1	great to own such a john candy dan akroid classic not recommended for children quite a lot of profanity	16
1	my kids really did learn a lot from this movie i would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty	16
0	starring sam from whose the boss and that guy that used to be married to christina applegate i really hate this movie it 's so boring and not exciting like drew barrrymores version	16
0	this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the 80s actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so	16
0	this film is among the worst most pointless and most inane garbage that i 've ever had the misfortune to view contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was creepy ! the little boy was extremely annoying and his relationship with the alien made me ill ! actually it made me more than ill it was down right disturbing ! his bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing i have ever had to witness and the kids family was just obnoixious by the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore you are just relieved that the film is finally over watch it only to say that you 've seen this	16
1	i really enjoyed this movie ! its not one of the best and a little cheesy ! but easy to watch and one of the funniest films ive seen him in ! just a shame he never got to show us what a good actor he could have been	16
1	this is one of the best animes i 've ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew cowboy bebop has now drawn wolf 's rain i love the music played in the series that 's why they made a cd came along with also a stuff amimal wolf i wish their was a second season cause i began to love the show	16
0	some scenes are repeated from the first it is not that bad thats all i can say i think i over rated it with 2 stars too many	16
1	in 2 weeks i will actually be at the vatican for my first visit this wonderful dvd showed me places and things that i will never be able to see as a tourist but just knowing about the workings of the vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit this is a beautifully done 90 min dvd as only national geographic could have done i was thrilled with every minute i spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when i get home to remember my trip	16
1	thank heaven for larry david and curb your enthusiam or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that was n't political except south park reno 911 which are really in a different league altogether	16
1	you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut but it 's actually the opposite i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people this movie is the real thing i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too	16
1	good subject the workings of a devious female mind a complicated love triangle superb acting	16
1	this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much	16
1	as i went through music school in the eary fifties i was confronted with lenny now at 72 i still have this pleasure there are people in the nyp that are legendary as are the performances this set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time i have left it is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future bob allshouse from the dana school of music 1952 57	16
0	this one is just plain awful ! ! it 's a bunch of hollywood brats being histrionic	16
0	really not worth the effort to find it even if george macdonald fraser was involved with the screenplay the producers chose the least best of the flashman novels to adapt they cast the wrong actor to play the role and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy not very funny slapstick comedy do n't bother searching for it true flashman fans will be disappointed	16
1	i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 workouts this video is incredibly challenging but i like that i can do the level 1 workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd	16
0	i placed a wrong order and so now i am not able to watch the dvd i purchased it was for area no 1 but we can't watch the no 1 area movies in turkey therefore i do not have a review	16
1	this movie was probably the best one next to lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi wish maker pokemon ranger centers around the legendary pokemon manaphy and of course ash and his friends some new and amazing characters include buizel jackie the ranger mantyke and chatot the annoying but funny pokemon the villian is great the ending is amazing and the effects were the best yet	16
1	i love dancehall queen ! i lost my first copy \( vhs \) so i replaced it with a new copy in dvd i never get tired of watching this movie and i consider it a jamaican movie classic right up there with harder they come rockers and smile orange it is a nice twist on the traditional rags to riches story although her character 's morals are somewhat questionable \( she practically sells her daughter to a high paying local don \) you ca n't help but root for the protagonist marcia	16
1	backing up the review that pointed out m night shyamalan 's earlier films the other movie is titled praying with anger \( also did screen play for stuart little \) all three movies in the box set are great and worth watching again and again	16
0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	16
1	as promised this product was sent brand new and arrived quicker than expected my brother loves soccer and thoroughly enjoyed this as a present for christmas	16
1	this movie is full of memorable scenes although it 's probably been more than a decade since i last saw it it 's suspenseful without being gory the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood and even though i 'd read the book and knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat right to the finish	16
1	the chronological donald vol 2 was the second box of my collection after i happen collected the first one the tin box contains 2 dvd9 look very precious but the shipment made its had some ding if you like disney you do n't miss this treasures collection the dvd content very classical and a lot of fun for your children	16
1	i bought this for my 3yr old twins and from the first showing i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales so they really loved the three little pigs and the pied piper i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children	16
0	this was just a boring movie ca n't understand the otherreview 's saying it 's good would n't reccomend it	16
0	might be a good video it just does n't interest our 10 month old yet like baby einstein does	16
1	this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man at first the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters but the series remain true to the comics the story lines they took from the comics were done very well like episodes involving the silver surfer	16
0	i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off the mark african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it was n't his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all	16
1	the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	16
0	dennis leary is hailed as some great angry young man who is trying to bring the world to rights personally i prefer bill hicks at least when bill did it he was being original ! ! ! ! ! ! ! dennis leary has in my opinion nicked bill hicks act in a similar way to how i feel about joss stone compared to proper soul artists sitting in front of a few live videos of a great man and taking notes does not mean you will ever be one dennis ! definately a must have for anyone who enjoys covers bands stick to the acting dennis	16
0	man i hate this ! i cannot take this any more watch the original and that is it the original needs no sequel at all every sequel to the original sucks	16
1	do n't listen to anyone when they say this movie is bad it 's good elektra is filled with aciton and fx and supervillians ! elektra is one of the best marvel movies ! go see it now	16
0	this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it	16
1	the quality was good and the stories were also good i am on the list when the first season comes out this is like a tease	16
1	i'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	16
1	this is an excellent film a lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at hbcu 's ! ! ! ! as a matter of fact the issue of lightskinned vs darkskinned is still going on today on a college campus or not spike lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time he is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the african american community i highly recommend this film if you have n't seen it get the dvd it 's a classic	16
0	i did n't even want to see this movie but my brother read the book and wanted to see it \( we were unaware of the fact that this was n't meant to follow the book \) everything was poorly done in this movie even hans zimmer 's score did n't save it i 've mentioned that i 'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars and if i could i 'd give it negative ten	16
1	this is a showcase of jet li 's brand of martial arts fast and furious while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going what i did'nt anticipate was the humor absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it 's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying	16
0	this is not a good movie ! bad acting story and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it	16
1	this is without a doubt one of harrison fords greatest moments an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i 've ever seen very dramatic with a lot of suspense a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view a film you will want to see again and again action mystery drama thriller there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such but they do n't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama i highly recommend it	16
1	this was a great history movie and in excelent condition at arrival thank yo	16
1	i decided to buy a couple strawberry shortcake movies when my 3 year old daughter received a bunch of strawberry shortcakes for her birthday these are very cute movies ! they have a couple of cute songs fun storylines and great messages	16
0	this movie is typical hollywood anti war anti military anti american trash the show biz liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the left wing tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as baby killing drug crazed monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers a much better and far more honest film	16
0	no reviews for this video as the disk i have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of no disk is displayed as the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a dvd is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the dvd as i have to ship in from india so i can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk	16
1	wow ! i had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful haunting score to match i'm glad our pleas have been heard ! with new high definition equipment coming down in price i ca n't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema update is this the region 2 4 version that was released overseas \? if so we are in for a real treat !	16
1	my six year old \( who has never been very excited about exercise \) really loves this dvd the routine is active fun and most importantly easy to learn other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered she completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning she asked to do it again ! my 2 1 2 year old has a great time dancing with us as well	16
0	i was so excited when this dvd came out hoping to get the four pittsburgh steelers highlight films from the '70s 98 of all this material is already included in the super bowl collection sets put out last year on dvd why wo n't nfl films step up and give us more \? \? \? this should be a steeler specific box set not some rehash of the entire season for all teams come on steve sabol give us what we want ! !	16
0	after doing this film steve martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it but roxanne la story and bowfinger are some of steve 's best works	16
0	i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	16
1	this reveals a great deal about vietnam and the 1960 's should be prized by students of kennedy johnson and our military history in the nuclear age	16
1	supposed being victimized by local communist regime and soviet oppressors since august 1968 a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals no wonder sex is a fix for such a lucky and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with southern european rather than slavic appearance a little extended up to 165 minutes of screening romantic tale with some near porno inclusions is a bit more over positive and over entertaining than its final collapsed in well movie spirit seems being similar to a beautiful life producers or more recent one of levi 's hitler as a comedy hero of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only	16
0	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave pilot dave and fireman dave i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks unfortunately there 's a new dave \( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues \) and it 's just not the same the new dave is not bad perse but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all	16

0	as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is this production was a waste of time space and money everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves the acting is bad the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink which it does badly it 's not the worse movie i 've seen but it 's surprisingly close please do n't waste your time with this film	16
0	leary is a hack he was n't influenced by bill hicks he stole material that makes him a hack how can you leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack \? take it up with webster 's dictionary the exact bits leary stole are described in the book american scream on pages 201 202 bill hicks was incensed when he heard leary 's tape on behalf of bill 's memory give credit to the original	16
0	brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them this is a blatant effort to wrench young children 's emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of global warming by engaging their sympathies the only plot is brainwashing using penguins as the straw man the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them as a responsible parent i would avoid this entirely	16

0	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed	16
1	this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox \? \?	16
0	this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out ! the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks	16
1	at first i was skeptical about buying an aging mccartney band tour dvd even though i have every one so i bought it i watched it from start to finish unbelievably superb the lighting the energy of the band and the crowd suprising interviews ! ! and ole paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark ! after watching it i felt like i had been there it is the best one i have seen yet ! if you like mccartney this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear ! excellent buy	16

0	i caught some of this on pbs and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast reba mcentire as nellie musicals are for people that can sing not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch i'm a native of arkansas by the way and it hurts my ears to listen to reba 's voice reba 's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	16

0	i am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well it was kind of cornie but with yvonne \( lily munster \) decarlo and a great actor in rod steiger it held my interest also throw in michael j pollard who always plays an off the wall character and i guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	16
1	these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is dated but the performances easily shine through not quite as well played recorded or filmed as bernstein 's many later unitel films but still well worth the investment i wo n't spend time on details but rest assured it 's all great stuff !	16
0	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out i was extremely disappointed the movie very well could be alright on its own merits but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	16

0	the frist time i saw this movie i hated it however i saw it again it still not that great but i own a copy its good to watch ewhen i feel sick or am stuck in the house for some other reason however the other two movies are much better	16
1	\( \) the watch has a nice weight beautiful face and is generously sized i need to have several links removed before i can wear it it comes nicely packaged although at first i did n't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included they were hidden inside the top of the watch box it was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time but once i got the pin out it was a snap to adjust the date and time all in all an excellent watch for a great price !	17
0	i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty it is actually quite large and cheap looking i was really disappointe	17
1	this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping \( though i would n't call it sweeping \) i give it a 5 based on looks and cost i have n't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly \( it was losing a few hours at night \) i guess it just needed to get charged up it 's no rolex but it 's no casio either	17
0	i really liked the watch as it looked in the picture but when i purchased it i realized that its way too shiny if you have a thin wrist then the watch looks really bulky besides the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north so you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time i am going to return this watch	17
0	i work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret santa thing around christmas time i bought this as a gift for the guy i got stuck with the thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip if i had given this as a gift people would have thought i raided the supply closet at work for a present total garbage	17
1	pleased with this purchase surprised how nice the watch actually looks	17
1	this was a pleasant surprise for the money and the craftsmanship is quite good only criticism is the adjustment of the band is a bit tedious it is certainly worth while and a durable product i would certainly buy this product again	17
1	no complaints it 's a nice change from a more feminine type of watch i usually prefer very nicely priced at amazon	17
0	i recived the watch and it is fine however i want to complain above amazon 's way to pack purchases amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box then i have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to this policy i use a mail forwarder from miami to caracas \( venezuela \) and i spread 19 instead 5 because box size and i recived a huge box full of air bags this situation is not the first time to happend and i hope amazon compense me in any way	17
1	service was prompt and the earings are beautiful i get compliments on them all the time and my sister asked for them on her birthday	17

1	i brought this for a good friend for the xmas 2006 season he just loved it and claimed that it is quite beautifu	17
1	i love knowing the exact time \( even if my mom thinks i am crazy \) and it works like a clock ! i never have issues with the updates \( in illinois \) but i do have a few minor issues the watch is too thick \( 5 8 inch \) the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human the buttons are hard to press and the manual is too small and hard to read still if i had a choice between this watch or my borhter 's rolex i will take his rolex and exchange it for 40 casios thank you casio	17
0	i guess you get what you pay for but i thought it would be a bit nicer than it was very cheap looking not well mad	17

1	see all over for double the price works great get lots of compliments more the my more expensive watches	17
1	being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon com and it is a top class item with a good finish the ring seems to keep it 's shine with no maintanence required as usual the service and delivery at amazon com is second to none as an american living in australia there are so many things i ca n't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them could n't be happier with this ring	17
1	very cute price efficiant only problem is if the band gets wet and you have sunscreen on your arm will get tinted blue	17
1	i really like them they look elegent on me one of the most favorite parts besides the looks that i especially like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place this reduces the risk of losing them but they are also light enough that i don t feel bogged down with them on my ears	17
1	the craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate very nice band not flimsy or cheap the world time is very cool	17
1	this watch is great looks great and feels great the hands clicking sound is almost none ! overall nice watch very happy with it	17

1	i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold	17
1	this is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven loved it but it bothered him that it did n't fit very well the velcro part did n't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust which worked pretty well by the way	17
1	my 26 yr old son got this for his birthday he loved it and wears at always	17
1	this watch is beautiful i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be	17
1	i am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than i expected the only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings i have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward i remedied that by changing the backings i am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them	17
1	this watch was purchased as a gift and i was pleasantly surprised when i received it the quality is excellent i had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky but i found it to be in line with watches of the same type this watch works well with casual and work attire and i was tempted to keep the watch for myself in fact i regret not purchasing one for me to keep buy with confidence	17
1	not much else o say they look and wear awesome the price is very good as well recommend these for anyone with pierced ears	17
1	i bought this watch for my bf on v day i ordered it on 2 10 and the order was here online fast shipping and item was in good shape will do business again in the future	17
1	best item i bought for a great price i would like to see more like thi	17
1	the keyring is very nice i had no idea just how light titanium is the caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight it 's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed making the ring kinda useless definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it additinally the metal is quite plyable and i 've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys	17
0	this is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy i am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis	17
1	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts overall very pleased and a great value	17
0	i bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price that is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch but i guess you get what you pay for	17
1	i bought this necklace because it was very on sale and i was surprised by how much i loved it when it arrived the beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit it 's a bold necklace but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse	17
1	these earrings are perfect to wear every day they are comfortable to sleep in no need to take them off in the evening they are small and classy will look great with any outfitthey are exactly what i was looking for and i'm really happy with them to help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone 's ear i 've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear see it in customer images	17
1	lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert key type clasp it 's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular use type of necklace i think it 's best suited for the nimble fingered traditional fashion person	17
0	i bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for everyday ear rings the tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair the earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on do not buy these	17
1	i am very pleased with these earrings they are a great quality at this price i would also recommend the matching pendant great set !	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
1	my husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek so this was the perfect christmas gift for him i was a little bit apprehensive when i recieved it but it works just like it should it is not apparent from the discription but this watch does have the date feature i could n't have gotten him a better gift for the price he wears it every day	17
0	one screw is gone amazon did not help me to replace it therefore the key ring is not operational the screws are very problematic	17

0	i bought this watch for my husband but did n't take the time to read the description carefully so it 's my fault i had to send it back he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift unfortunately it does not work if you 're more than 2 000 miles from colorado if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch	17
1	for the price this is a great buy ! colors are good has a nice weightto it ! would buy more from this merchant	17
1	i love this pendant very shiny and substantial the back looks as good as the front i also wear this on a black leather cord \( 16 \) and it gives it a whole new look great buy	17
0	the product pretty much snapped in half while i was trying to remove two links from one watch the other one i tried before this one did n't fit in the adjustment piece at all so with that said do not buy this product at all it 's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use instructions are very unclear i ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed	17
1	excellent quality beautifully packaged they were exactly as described and just what i was looking for	17
1	threaders are in and these are about the most elegant looking threaders i 've seen the stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly it is nice to have such a refined option for such a hip style	17
1	i was searching for a watch for weeks saw a picture of this watch and paused intrigued i began to read the specs alarm chronograph thermometer light stopwatch world time zones and more what 's the catch \? 55usd c'mon seriously with all those features is that all \? i was still skeptical but when i got the watch put it on my wrist i was sold solid well crafted unique sporty elegant combination my only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature we ca n't have the world but casio has come close with this price i can honestly say go for it	17
0	this item was a nice gift the stones were a little discolored but that 's what you get for only paying 100 for 1 4 carat earings online	17
0	it might just be really bad luck but after three fossil watches \( 1 x blue 2 x titanium \) i 've never managed to make them last more than two years each they are really cool look great and the price is reasonable but this is the third time fossil lets me down and to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful this time i'm looking for another brand as i feel i'm wasting my money	17
1	it was a gift and i was pleased with the good quality and workmanship	17
1	this cute little watch comes with a real eye patch my son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye	17
0	the heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear i do not recommend the product but the delivery and service were done well	17
0	the quality of the stones is horrendous there are significant inclusions which are visible with naked eye from as far away as 3 feet these diamons should have been turned into diamond dust not set into jewelery	17
1	very nice piece just beware of the size it 's much bigger than it appears in this picture it does hang nice on the silver cord however the clasp is backwards and with the cord it does not flex to the correct position	17
1	these are delicate classic gold hoops that go with anything i like the fact that they are unadorned and simple and small enough to be understatated but large enough to give you an elegant look the price ca n't be beat either	17
1	this watch looks great although i was afraid that it was going to be bulky it has worked great for my husband the only problem we have had with it is setting the date on it no matter what time of day we set the date it is always the wrong date by the next day	17
1	when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it was the price was insane for the quality and workmanship i will order more for my sisters	17
1	very handsome easy to read face and date window especially like the day date display most watches in this price range feature date only excellent value	17
1	beautiful deep blue round crystal post earrings i love them	17
1	this is an excelllent watch and it does what it promises to be	17
1	this watch changes the background color from red to black is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance	17
1	i did n't realize how picky my taste is with rings until i scoured amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me this ring is one of the few i found and i am far from a fan of having stones in my rings it has a nice low profile i 've yet to have it catch on anything i'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings but this again managed to sidestep that distaste the stone has no backing so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle tinted by my finger	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loves this product it holds his money in the clipper and his credit cards on the opposite side it 's beautiful silver and looks very professional	17
1	my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend 's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young \( or old \) girlfriend with an entry level nice gift they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance recommended	17
1	these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag a very nice gift	17
1	saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for 125 more very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	i really love this watch it looks so nice and elegant shipping is supper fast only 2 days ! great deal many thanks	17
0	the earrings are very pretty but the posts arrived bent the material for the post is too soft	17
1	needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything including great taste she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it it arrived promptly in time for christmas and it is very stunning not gaudy at all just classic style beauty could probably be worn to her office each day \( upscale casual \) or if she is dressed up the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself and i am not a huge jewelry fan	17
0	i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service \( communication and such \) have been very good i purchased this bracelet a few months ago and \( a few days ago \) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer i was taking it off and it snapped in the middle once you could see the insides it was obviously not pure sterling silver as the materials portion indicates i will be returning this item for a new one \( already gave my girl a matching one \) and may not even wear it at all very disappointing	17

0	i bought this for my grandson for christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box the clasp broke and it 's not repairable apparently it 's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled it 's too fragile to just pull from the holder	17
1	perfect watch just as i expected lokks great both casual and semi formal	17
1	my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable	17
1	i bought this pair to wear in my second ear piercing with a larger set of peridots in my first but i would also wear these alone the pair i received are a lovely color very recommended	17
1	i have owned both the black monster with bracelet \( my daily work watch \) and the orange with the rubber strap \( which i sold to an envious friend \) besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint	17
1	i like this watch it 's good price and also cool look \) hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it	17
1	i was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic considering the price i was so very wrong ! the necklace is gorgeous ! the clasp is sturdy and not easy broke package it was mailed in was also very good i am able to christmas wrap it in the package provided excellent service thank you ! !	17
1	although i 've only had it a few weeks i have had many compliments and questions on where i got it it is detailed and solid with a great message would recommend it	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
1	these are beautiful at a total 50 carat for the pair each 25 carat stud is well matched for color and clarity if you like white gold and diamonds you wo n't be disappointed	17
1	they are comfy and i am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals i can not the thing is i have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears i think but other than that they are just fine	17
1	i am very small featured and these are the perfect size light weight and very well made	17
1	these are very nice light weight earrings the look silver and black even though they are not so keep that in mind when you purchase them as to what the will go with i wear lots of black so it was a pleasant surprise for me very antique look to them	17
1	i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it ca n't lose with this one	17
1	this watch is exactly what i was looking for it is a small pretty functional watch that is quite durable it has plenty of features but is not extremely complicated the color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures	17
1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
1	great errings i got these for my 12 y o neice but decided they were too long for her but loved them for myself very cute	17
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive yet reliable accurate stylish analog \( rather than digital \) timepiece this is the watch for you easy to set up comfortable to wear no backlight so hard to read in low light a good buy	17
0	ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what i received was worse than expected in part because amazon sent the wrong item spoke with customer service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first however the same wrong item was again sent the problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket one even cheesier than the product listed i contacted customer service regarding the replacement they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct eventually both lockets have been returned there did n't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket i wound up ordering a completely different design from another vendor	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least the human powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch although i bought the black faced kinetic coutoura seiko the gold silver version of this watch is lovely also great quality gorgeous appearance reasonable price definitely consider this watch	17
1	this pendant makes for a really nice accessory it does n't however come with a chain so plan on buying one or using an old one	17
1	got this at amazon for a great price the design is by edwatd mirell whose collection of mens 's jewelry is unrivaled \( sp \? \) this bracelet sells at michaels jewelers at the mall for 100 00 i'm getting some of his other designs here at amazon you wo n't regret it it 's an elegant but masculine bracelet happy holiday 's	17
0	it is constructed nicely however i could not open any of my watches with the pegs kept falling out of it hard to work with	17
1	these earrings are a substantial weight even though they are hollow and the filigree detailing is superb ! i fell in love with these when i saw them on the site while shopping for xmas presents for friends and just had to order a pair for myself	17
0	i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from they have very large very visible flaws i know the color and clarity were posted on the website but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair \? people wo n't notice anything without taking a good close up look though and like i said i still love to wear them despite the quality	17
1	i love this item ! i bought one for each of my bridesmaids as their gift from me these jewelry rolls are beautiful and appear to be very useful in holding jewelry there 's even a place to hold your rings \)	17
1	these earrings are very pretty i'm very pleased ! nice faceting and sparkle the stones are a medium bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful the peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest i 've owned so far highly recommend	17
1	i have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing i ca n't tell if they 're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture and i always get compliments when i wear them sometimes people ask me what stone they are they ca n't even tell it 's synthetic ! ! no bubbles or anything like the bad review here says	17

1	i sent these for my cousin \( who has everything ! \) on her 16th birthday when i saw them later they were smaller than i expected but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated they are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold i would recommend these	17
1	i actually bought these two years ago then again for my mother this past christmas we both love the sets they 're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection the colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched nice size not too small not too big	17
1	i have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son 's care giver when it arrived my sisters and i were tempted to keep them for ourselves they were lovely i particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet they are what i would term fun pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only i am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces it was a good buy at the sale price oddly enough i also liked the packaging the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little gift boxes on the inside	17
1	i bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily this one is very good so far and my wife loves it for the price i paid it is a great product	17
1	i bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made the pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic it is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it i think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky	17
1	pretty pendant for the price the chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well	17
0	the first day i wore this ring one of the stones fell out the day it fell out i was typing on the computer did not even know it came out till later did not find the stone would not recomend this ring	17

0	i bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off i felt like the biggest loser when i contacted amazon they said that because it was over 2 months that i had bought the earrings i could n't return them what a rip off these earrings do n't even deserve 1 star	17
1	this watch is beautiful the picture do n't make any justice the quality from amazon is flawless highly recommended	17
1	i do n't know for whom watchebands are sized perhaps the incredible hulk in his green phase \? all i know is i'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band the climate my activities this procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands this complete kit does the trick a couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and i'm done could n't get much simpler i finally got this kit after wrestling with a new fossil band that would not cooperate used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice wish i had it years ago	17
1	these are my favorite earrings i wear them constantly they are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit they are a bit larger than you might anticipate and it is a size i really like but which might overpower some the picture at least on my monitor is about life sized	17
1	beautiful detailed and accurate time piece i have a few watches and this is one i place ahead of all the others i have large face and can be read at a glance	17
1	i bought this gift for my sister in law and it was beautiful it is high quality and looks great	17

0	not what i expected the box was handmade the instructions were some other tool i have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response	17
1	i always wear timex and never have a problem	17
1	i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly	17
0	this bracelet is actually really nice but too bad it is so cheaply made that mine broke in about 2 weeks it 's easily fixed all i need is to get new end clasps and attach them to the leather braid but i was hoping for a better made product	17
1	wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you are n't going into the hole the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend i straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream also good lighting is a must	17
0	i understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set when the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet it was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking the neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws yeach	17

1	i bought two of these \( one for each daughter 3 6 \) it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children thank you	17
1	this invicta 2699 watch it 's a nice watch the case of stainless steel polished looks very well solid with transparent case back although there is nothing exceptional to look at dial of mother of pearl clear and clean with not too many words or other dials on it looks elegant the roman numbers are very good for that dial the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions the movement is a miyota automatic with 21 jewels works fine for the price it has poor power reserve so if you do not use it for 24 hours it will stop nothing to worry about	17
1	i have a disabled child and i got this as a gift from my husband and children i look at it and i feel so greatful for the family i have	17
1	classic style and leather too ! the perfect little black watch at the perfect price	17

1	this watch has a large display and easy to use functions i get a lot of compliments on the unique band it 's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty i ca n't think of anything i would like to change about it	17
1	i recieved this watch for christmas and i'm still blown away looking at it had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link \( my wrists are small \) because the links are difficult to do themselves but that 's probably just for emphasis on quality it came in a fossil christmas tin very well packaged i'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection	17
1	these watches are just what my little boy was looking for since his identical watch broke he was so happy i not only found 1 but 6 for the price of one these are nice for a child who is just learning to tell time	17

0	i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch however it never worked i do n't know if it had a dead battery or if it 's broken the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch i will try to resolve the issue with amazon	17
1	i got this watch to help me with running walking and yoga it was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up but i am thrilled with the end result i recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs	17
0	very lousy quality faceplate fell off on arrival	17
1	i love this watch it was my christmas present to myself the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches a perfect gift and good quality i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep	17

1	first of all i recieved the item in a very timely fashion approx 3 days second the packaging was very nice the chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality heavy and prettier in person	17
0	i know these watches were inexpensive but 2 right out of the box were broken and others broke very easily the clock functions well but the straps fall apart easily	17
0	the instructions that you do get are wrong the items i get and the ones listed are totally different it does n't tell you how to use each of the tools some of the tools i'm still puzzled in what to do with it the soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet does n't look too soft too me !	17
0	i find it intresting that i am being asked to rate a product that was ordered 6 weeks ago and i still have not received or have been given a notice of shippment	17
1	my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first it is nice for dressy or casual highly recommended	17
1	exactly the size i was looking for i knew i could do better than the baby hoop earrings looks great	17
1	the pendant is striking shiny and great to look at the diameter of the pendant is the size that i expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it great purchase would buy it again	17

1	i bought this to save for a christmas gift it is a very nice looking piece of jewelry	17
0	i ordered and paid for the watch band adjusting sizing link removing tool kit in box because of the picture of the tool box and i receive a totally different equipment than what is on the picture please make the vendor send me the correct item i ordered	17
1	i 've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite i love the large face and the titanium bracelet \( you do n't have to remove the watch in order to shower ! \) a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too given the price and quality you ca n't go wrong if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen the work is completed in a couple of weeks ! in summary an elegant watch at a reasonable price	17
1	this was a gift and was lovely and beautiful not too big not to small delivery time was great strongly advice to buy this	17
1	as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture	17
1	i came across this looking for angel pendants i bought this one and the matching earrings i absolutely love this pendant ! wear it all the time and always get compliments on it you can wear it year round ! one of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time i wore it ! would n't recommend those ! but this winged pendants is beautiful	17
1	this heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets the box makes a v day or anniversary gift even more special your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift the watch pillow is plush padded box top and outside inside box is lined with velvet	17
1	i bought these for my sister for christmas and she absolutlely loved them	17
1	this is the most beautiful bracelet the piece is awesome the sentiment is so true i love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though i 'd bought it as a gift the workmanship is superb the bracelet arrived 2 days after i placed my order in a well packaged box the bracelet was in a white box with a gold ribbon around it	17
0	i got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests but none of the kids or i have been able to reset it my daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch the 2 little knobs ca n't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying instruction sheet needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use them then the purpose is defeated the service was great but the product is unsatisfactory phyllisunsatisfied custome	17
1	item came to me fast it is very confortable and very reliable i do n't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves i highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people	17
1	it 's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost it 's not filmsy or cheap it 's durable and great	17
1	lovely little apple charm just what i wanted picture a little deceptive though i thought the charm would be larger than it actually was otherwise great item i'm happy	17
1	excellent quality the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do the ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples pits or other defects i am very happy with this purchase	17
1	i'm quite happy with these and writing to say so because other users' comments were very helpful to me especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial i e though diminutive they have bulk so are visible with nice warm glow	17
1	i bought this watch to replace an older similar model it is simple and functional perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training	17
0	this was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it the only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened not worth the price	17
0	i did n't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before i purchased the watch this is disney and tinker bell ! the word flirt did n't bother me either because tinkerbell was a flirt wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band i was shocked that this watch is under the children 's section i needed this for my grand daughter 's birthday like it was said before i could have given this five stars but hot and saucy for a young girl oh no	17
1	greetings exelente product and magnifies attention from the store thanks kindly domenico pascarell	17
0	i bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch for swimming and running unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming is unbelievably bulky and has this strange time setting system which only works in the usa and europe \( i live in australia \) in the end i gave it to a relative in the usa	17
1	this is a fun item to own i spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet i think a solution should be included with the item	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as his valentine 's day gift he loved it ! it 's a great price for this watch as well	17
0	do n't buy this item i was cheated now i am gonna send it back its really waste of your money do n't go by the price i will never buy anything from this site	17
1	these are so pretty i 'd like to have a whole box of them just to look at originally coolstyles mis shipped my order but acted quickly to make sure that i got my shipment by christmas i was very pleased with that	17
1	nice watch for the price case is a little bigger than some but a nice watch with easy to read face	17
0	these earrings have no blue in them ! the picture is extremely deceiving	17
0	though evenly matched the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these are n't apparent if you are wearing them about the quality you 'd expect from mervyn 's or sears on sale not terrible but not great	17
1	very nice size almost perfect shape beautiful luster and color great to wear with almost anything they are very chic and classy i'm very happy i bought them ! !	17
1	this necklace is just as advertised i like it a lot i was looking for an almost choker necklace i would really like a wider one but this one will do	17
1	i love love these earrings i bought them because i wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time unless there is something special then i will change for a special occasion but these earrings i wear in the shower they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold i received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date	17
1	i bought these earrings for my 10 year old grandaughter for christmas i think she has worn them everyday since she loves them they are not large hoops if fact they are a bit small but perfect for her for an adult i think a little bit larger size would be better all in all i was very pleased with the earrings the quality is very good	17
0	this pendant is on the cheap looking side but you get what you pay for i guess	17
1	great value for the price better than expected in person quality watch for the price love this undersea face better than the other models out there was happy to find out that even though the band is kid sized it also fits adult women 's wrist highly recommend will probably buy one or 2 more	17
1	i bought this for my sister for christmas i have a similar one that is bigger that i bought while in charleston sc she fell in love with mine and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question i decided on this one at first when it arrived i thought it would be too small but my sister does not wear large neclaces earrings etc turns out she loved it it was just perfect for her especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive	17
1	this is probably one of the lightest smallest watches with an interval timer feature which is why i got it it 's also pretty cheap it has a decent number of other options as well this particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model very quality	17
1	as a gift this bracelet will not disappoint it appears just \( or better \) as it does in the picture the only downside is that for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure there will not be any give nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable otherwise one cannot go wrong with selecting it	17
1	i purchased these at 16 in december 2006 they are currently running for 15 which is so worth it for 14k white gold earrings at this price you should be thinking about next year 's christmas presents otherwise if you are looking for a treat for yourself you will not be disappointed the reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size the earring backs should be larger they are on the small side	17
1	this one is excellent for the price good build and accurate i wish it had alert function	17
1	this pendant is much prettier in person it 's got a nice polished finish not satin matte like in the image it hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain i 've already received several compliments on it	17
1	the th watch was a dream watch to the person it was gifted to it was bought for a friend and he just loved it	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast	17
0	these were the worst pair of earings i have ever seen they were yellow from a mile away amazon was very accomodating when i returned them but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings	17
1	it look very nice will be an excellente gift for any friend i just have a complaint they just carry this item in zise 7 but still looking very fanc	17
0	i think the picture is better than the real thing the gems are actually pretty decent they are a good size and have a hint of color however the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on you ca n't see the sparkle of the stones if the setting was daintier and the stones had more color these would look great but as they are the earrings look like blobs not tanzanite	17
1	beautiful box to hold most of my watches have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings this box holds those watches in less space ! having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance ! another 10 in the drawer below if you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item	17
1	i went onto ebay and found the same product for slightly less but the shipping was outrageous ! great product clockwise or counter clockwise rotation i have it in my office on the back of my desk and i can barely hear it working if i pay attention to it nice design and looks good	17
1	lightweight great price self adjustable this was the perfect gold toned watch for me ! i shopped around and amazon had the best price for this watch	17
1	this watch comes in a cute box which shows what 's inside the contents are nicely spread out and the presentation is certainly appealling to the eyes of a little girl excellent product	17
0	the pic online is not a true representation these are more like baby cuffs was so embarassed to give as a xmas gift	17
1	i purchased one of the casio men 's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch vq200hda 9bvcf from amazon this watch is great it updates the time automatically \( just switched to daylight savings and i did n't have to touch a thing \) instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates again cool looking great watch ! ! ! !	17
1	it is good and nice design but it is little bit heavy	17
1	the necklace arrived quickly especially considering that it came from thailand good quality for a good price thanks for good service will be buying jewelry from this seller again	17
1	i just got this watch as a christmas present it is gorgeous the only thing is it 's a little bigger than i would like it to be the face is so femanine but the size makes it a little masculine the face is about an inch and a half in diameter and the band is a little over a half inch wide because it is so pretty i am keeping it however if you prefer a small dainty watch maybe this one is n't for you my friends are telling me bigger watches are in now so maybe they 're right \? \?	17
1	i needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well	17
1	i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it	17
1	i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive but still professional looking i like the lightness of the watch the thin size and the simple design it does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than i would like but still not very noticeable if you have n't seen other comments about getting the watch sized pay attention i took it to a professional jewelry repair shop and they still could n't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches i would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while the jeweler i went to has a good reputation but does not sell skagen	17
1	this is a great looking watch and i like that it is lightweight i took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed it 's just techie enough for a geek like me \( updates via satellite days of the week in several languages etc \) enjoy	17
1	this is a great watch the clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust it was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition well made and light it 's extremely slim so if you really like heavy watches this may not be your choice otherwise it is perfect for everyone	17
0	i had this heart rate monitor for 7 days the first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting i tried everything and it just did not work the watch itself was fine i ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar	17
0	i liked the watch i had to send the first one back because the date would never change i got the second one a month ago and have n't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash nice looking watch too bad i have to carry it around in my pocket now	17
1	i bought this watch for my son a marine serving in iraq because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm this one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light especially at night it is comfortable and sits close to the wrist with very little profile he loves it and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back up !	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
1	the watch looks and feels great i did a lot of looking around before i decided on this watch and i'm very happy with my choice ! i would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price well done invicta and amazon on a great product	17
1	this is a sleek sharp quality watch and the lowest priced model that i 've seen in the arctura series if you can catch it on sale i think its a great buy however be prepared for the weight this is the heaviest watch i 've ever worn and probably the largest if you 're used to wearing stainless watches it will probably be fine for you i'm used to leather bands and the weight difference is quite noticeable wish i could find this watch in titanium that would be perfect overall if you 're not bothered by the large size or weight it looks great and i'm sure the quality is also	17
0	bought this as a christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped thought i could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature however it is now january 18th and i still cannot program the watch frustrate	17
1	this is a perfect anytime gift i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top perfect for any occasion she 'll love it this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingplus it 's under 100 ca n't beat the price thanks amazon	17
1	it is what he wanted and you provided it for him thanks i made points as a good grandmother	17
0	these earrings are very pretty but the post is way too thick they killed my ears and i had to return them i would guess the post is at least 2 5 times as thick as a normal post and my ears did not like it ! ! !	17
0	these were on my mom 's wishlist so i bought them they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed i 'd return them if it would n't cost me and i was n't so lazy they look pretty darn cheap for starters also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo velour bag with a price tag for 3 30 on it save your money it 's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen	17
1	i ordered for my grand daughters xmas present and she loves them mission accomplished ! ! !	17
1	i 've owned this model for about seven years and i think i 'll buy another to keep on standby in case i break the original \( i'm not gentle with my watches while working playing \) tough pretty easy to set good features and classic diver style at a great price what 's not to like \? would n't mind having a light on the lcd otherwise it is proven a great investment battery lasts 2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same \( cracks develop after a while \) no corrosion \( duh stainless steel \) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far	17
0	while the style of the necklace was nice the quality of the silver is poor very poor and not marked as being silver either which makes me wonder if its silver at al	17
1	as other reviewers have stated this watch is large and it 's heavy i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms the night light is cool and effective	17
1	the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she 's used them for some time	17
1	this is an excellent tool set for beginners the quality of the tools is not professional grade but more than adequate for the hobbyists for the price you pay this is an excellent deal a little more money than some of the other kits being sold on amazon com but well worth it as you get a complete set	17
1	my husband has become an avid watch collector so i gave him this box for christmas the design of the box is as attractive as its contents my husband says that it is easy to use too from the looks of things i will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection	17
1	good tool it does what is it meant to do open the back of watches with ease man this is so much better than scratching watchbacks with pliers so far its been able to open all my watches with no issue	17
1	this watch has it all at a nice price the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand hair if u have and i doubt that u do n't have else is a masterpiece all stainless steel even base thermomener and a smart cronograph plus 3 yrs battery this is my favourite no other watch has this price quality proportion try it and u will be satisfied sporty but looks elegant too	17
0	very disappointed in the watch and amazon the day date did not work on delivery but i was unaware of it until the end of february when i tried to manually change the date i found that it was broken at that time about a week after i received the watch the day date did change automatically each night amazon refused t orepalce it because i had the band adjusted seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3 4 weeks ! had i purchased it from a reputable local store i could have exchanged it for a new watch	17
0	i have purchased eight of these units over the past year two of the eight have stopped working altogether and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve the seller replaced the first unit that failed and when i requested replacement of the second unit i was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features they could not offer the new model to me in exchange but they did offer a 20 discount it arrived today and seems to be working well if you are considering purchasing any unit made by this manufacturer \( garnin \) consider it as suitable for short term use rather than long term usage	17
1	i'm delighted with my skagen watch as i was with the previous one i lost i find the clean modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out the analog dial is easy to read the mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size the silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry	17
1	this is a really nice looking watch keeps accurate time would recommend to anyone considering did a lot of research and amazon had the best price with free shipping	17
1	i 've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week \( checked against apple network time server \) the watch looks good and i ca n't say i 've had a problem with the digital display if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1 of buyers will actually use it one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers are n't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness a silly oversight hence 4 stars overall though well worth the money	17
1	the watch was delivered on time it came with the little box everything was in great like new condition	17
1	got this today and ca n't stop looking at it it 's beautiful all who have seen it want one i cant wait to try more of their jewelry	17
1	i 've seen very inconsistant reviews for silver insanity items i received this necklace for christmas last year and it 's pretty nice generally i always receive a compliment when i wear it for the price it 's worth it if you 're looking for something nicer you 're simply going to have to pay more	17
1	got this ring last christmas for my wife it still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is she gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it	17
0	i 've owned it for a few months the crystal scratches easily mine has a dozen or more serious scratches which makes the face hard to read not a good buy	17
1	this is a nice looking watch overall if you like this style in black look for the t233xltmn it is a very very nice watch and popular in europe	17
1	i was pleased when i received my earrings however they 're smaller in reality than what 's pictured on the website but they 're still pretty	17
0	i bought this ring for my fiance since i have one and it 's a terrible ring we got it apart and then have not been able to get it back together it 's been over a month now we went online to get the directions that did n't help either plus the ring is so cheap it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape it is cheap and completely useless	17
0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
0	looked good on me this watch but i found out just in time that this did not carry seiko's regular two or three year warranty since it is a grey market watch having read the many complaints about this seiko monster i decided i needed a warranty so for this simple reason i had to return it to amazon right away and am in the process of exchnaging it with another brand that does have warranty	17
1	i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me cute though	17
1	this watch is so light and thin but so good looking that even my husband who does n't like watches weighing him down wears it every day after three months i do n't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching because it still looks perfect	17
1	i am pleased with this watch it is inexpensive yet has a lot of features the only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this pendant is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper they look like toys ! i also bought the earrings set with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( only the packaging is of good quality in this product i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
1	i wear it almost everyday and it 's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band	17
1	i really love these earrings and wear them quite a bit to spice up work clothes	17
1	i love the workmanship in this piece nicely done and silver insanity has awesome customer service	17
1	i got this as a present after putting it on my wish list i love it it is really delicate and pretty it 's a little smaller than i thought it would be but still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry	17
1	this is a perfect anytime gift i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top perfect for any occasion she 'll love it this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingplus it 's under 100 ca n't beat the price thanks amazon	17
1	i got these for 9 on the friday sale they are well made and the perfect size you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price wait for the friday sale if you can	17
0	they could not be any smaller the diamonds or the earrings i should have known better	17
1	i ordered a pair for myself and liked them stones are pretty clear n cute but earrings are smaller than shown in the picture	17
1	nice watch very simple hands are very luminous like the magnified date window	17
1	exceptional value in a classy and understated design keeps time in a superior fashion highly recommended	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	light intricate and very cute ! they came very quickly and the price was very fair ! i have a second piercing in my left ear and i like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry i always have a fairy whispering in my ear	17
1	i very much like these earrings my only reason for not giving them a 5 star rating is that the topaz is quite small you really have to look closely to see it but they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful i recommend them just be aware that the stones are tiny	17
1	i have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings very nice size and great quality they are light weight and have a great hinge i have a baby who sometimes grabs them but they have yet to be bent out of shape i sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears do n't ever develope a reaction	17
0	i bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews i thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches rather than paying 10 each time to have a professional do it i was so disappointed in this tool the link remover only pushes the pins out halfway you are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way as you can imagine this is not easy my husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out knowing what i know now i would definitely have invested in a different link remover	17
1	i purchased this with a gift certificate for myself for the price you can not complain too much this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box i suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece	17
0	i bought a nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago the strap is already falling apart near the bezel the watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal even if the problem is poor workmanship	17
0	i was bought this present for valentines day it 's pretty i do wear them for everyday us	17
1	this is a great watch ! ! ! ! it feels heavy it 's big it looks awesome with a blue shirt and it will distinguish you in any crowd ! you can wear it as a dress watch or with a sports shirt it just looks great ! the best fossil i 've ever bough	17
0	not as they appear ! march 8 2007reviewer rappster \( denver co \) see all my reviewsi ordered these earrings on a 'gold box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive they were such a disappointment i returned them the next day i did not expect the diamonds to be huge based on their cttw but the earrings themselves are miniscule ! they look like they were made for children i tried on one earring and could n't even see the earring in my ear much less tell there were any diamonds it looked like i did n't even have an earring on !	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast \) i love these earrings i have worn at least one day a week since i receive	17
1	these are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work diamonds are a nice clear quality	17
1	do n't buy this watch unless you want it \( and your good taste \) to be admired it 's just beautiful sort of like man jewelry for guys that do n't wear jewelry but i plan to wear it only when i wear certain clothing to certain events i have other watches for other situations	17
1	all right so these earrings are absolutely adorable ! they are fun and go with anything ! good size good quality i would buy for someone as a gift	17
1	i ordered one each for my 5 year old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine 's day nice pearl color and oval like shapes slightly too big for a 5 year old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult very dainty a great buy for the price	17
0	the earrings are nice a great value at 30 however the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore the posts are not the typical size one might find in us stores the posts are more typical of earrings that i have purchased in central southern america in fact this is where the earrings were made i returned them	17
1	i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews but they are for my two year old so i figured they really could n't be too small and they are not i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more and guess what the quality of theese is soooo much better all in all yes they are tiny but very cute and do n't lack detail ! will buy again	17
0	daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose	17
1	i'm a pretty big guy so it does n't look out of place but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy it runs well keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability if you 're an extra large person and do n't mind a heavy watch you may be interested in this if you 're average size or smaller i would n't recommend it personally this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet proof in normal use	17
1	i was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is it is a little smaller than i pictured but it is a nice non flashy watch i have n't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks so if you are looking for a subtle but cute watch this is for you but if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice i 'd look elsewhere	17
0	fair warning had i had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company 's watches i never would have bought one do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money the percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low	17
1	my boyfriend found this watch at a retail store put it on his christmas list i purchased it at amazon at a much better price this was a replacement watch for an old timex watch my boyfriend says he loves this watch no complaints at all he says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch he especially likes the large easy to read display	17

1	i have shooting pains in my upper left arm said the pilot to brian brian is the main character in the book hatchet this book would be for someone who likes survival in the wilderness or even just survival i like this book because i am into this type of writing i think gary paulson is a very intelegant man because who could have thought of a book about a boy who his plain crashes into the canadian wilderness and do you think he survived the wilderness \? he does survive the wilderness ! submitted by peanut !	18
1	this is by far my favorite novel by forster and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels period in his first book forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i at least feel that he lost as he got more self consciously quot philosophical quot in later books like howard 's end and a passage to india he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art bringing them to vivid life undermining tourist cliches and weaving them gracefully into his main themes no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18
0	i was disappointed in this book the art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a tv craft show i would instead recomment robert wade 's watercolor book	18
1	i purchased the book with the intention of teaching myself all the core material in it the material offers readers a limited number of examples per chapter per section while these examples may sometimes make you wish for added detail ultimately there is enough explanation to pull the reader through be sure you understand the previous chapter before moving onto the next or you will most likely get lost in the end i was very satisfied with my order listen to me if your at least decent in math you 'll do just fine following this algebra 2 textbook	18
0	i wanted to like this book but i had to give up in the end if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough the execution of detail is n't kosinski ca n't write he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important whereas the reader is always expected to discover depth in simplicity nothing to be recommended for	18

1	so many disbelievers out there ! i feel so sorry for you no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds \? of course this book is on the level while my dog ernestine does not build art pieces as such she 's a pretty good cook and a crack shot so why not dog artists \? the review of dog art is a little species centric however most of the dog artists i know use faecies or urine to construct art or engage in performance pieces rooting the leg and licking the balls spring to mind dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the same as human cuture so a little less chauvanism please ms mathison	18
1	a great read for anyone interested in cards i managed to pretend to my friends that i knew nothing about cards before cleaning them out after reading this book	18
1	the trilogy just stunned me and i worked at trying to understand its complexities then i read this book and everything made sense at first i declared that the trilogy was better than 'the lord of the rings' but could not explain why this book nails it it will be wonderful if you read the trilogy read this book and share everything with your children remember when 'expanding your consciousness' was all the rage \? no \? that 's ok all these books do it with a basis in science buy the darn books buy them for your friends	18

1	the color tabs really help you know what section to look at the only disadvantages of this field guide are that it does n't document every species in north america and that the new national geographic field guide to the birds of north america fifth edition has the blue grouse split into the sooty and dusky grouse making it more up to date ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! still this field guide has many good things	18
0	the unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes dan brown look like borges in comparison naming characters guard one just shows you do n't even try to care the plot is so hair brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache i just learned to my horror that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times i 'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise but it 's been ruined forever by this somewhere baby jesus is crying	18

1	i used this book as a student and still use it for teaching pieces are nice and students are challenged to think musically it moves quicker than some other method books it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate upon completion of the first grade book students can play standard repertoire in the early intermediate level students must have completed early elementary level before using this book because this book starts with playing two hands in c position emphasize phrasing from the first piece highly recommended	18

1	this is the text i love the best and it is easy to read and with the words of jesus in red my only criticism in that the corners of the cover tend to bend they are made of cardboard which is not as durable as leather for which i would have paid more however it is very good value and the delivery was as swift as ever	18
0	will somebody please tell me what the appeal is \? yes i know it 's a classic but it 's a really really boring classic the prequel to charlotte bronte 's jane eyre is the story of bertha mason 's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why bertha went nuts it 's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they did n't like little french girls in jamaica racism sexism and classism drove bertha `round the bend there i 've saved you the trouble of reading it now re read jane eyre instead	18

0	this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook \( certainly by european standards \) but the physical packaging is a total disaster it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins it is difficult to read text near the spine and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page the most unuseable book i 've ever experienced	18

1	this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre christian origins of the marian cult other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so called quot bvm quot the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church	18

0	not even worth finishing this book ! this author does not know enough to even write this book ! i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be it is a one sided story not based on facts which it what most writers do but purely fiction ! the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on not the postive stories that i hear about everyday do n't waste your money	18

0	i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i 'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals	18
1	that about says it all bill bryson is a hilarious writer i like reading grammar books anyway but i was always excited to read this book as it 's so entertaining besides that it can teach \( or remind \) you of a lot of good rules of writing the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary and some necessary entries are left out	18

1	i enjoyed this book having read other non fiction frontier books however i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools objects etc i could have done without i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker because such descriptions were so detailed if you 're a technical hands on person then you probably would like knowing how items tools were built from raw materials in the frontier but for me i was more interested in the story than the instructionals	18

1	i really enjoyed this book it was n't completely comprehensive but did give a good overview of buffet 's investment style while it did n't go heavily into the analysis of stocks that i would have liked it did describe who influenced buffet thanks to this book i was able to pick up some fisher and graham and have learned quite a bit all in all i would reccomend this book for someone interested in a light biography of buffet or a little insight into how he makes decisions	18

0	with someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome why dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of shakespeare 's most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me it 's not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it literally if you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like wiley 's chemistry concepts and problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple straightforward manner for anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school 's curriculum is just absurd	18

0	i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them	18
0	thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we 're reading a story we like to look for clues in what we 've read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done john grisham cheats us out of that fun the villian of this book is n't introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then was n't valid to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings \? that 's bad read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules	18

1	wow wow wow get this book ! this has \( just about \) everything you need to be professional the only thing i did n't like is that most of the resources listed were geared to nyc residents but there was good direction as to how to locate similar services in your area i especially liked the opening that deals with how artists are helping to perpetuate their own starving artist myth and the ways to stop that it made me realize that i am the one standing in the way of my own success ! well no more thanks to caroll i am taking all of the steps listed i wish my graduate school had this information available	18
0	i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original in the original chinese and if that the case they should write their own version	18
0	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole quot adversarial quot situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard	18
1	the essential histories series from osprey could easily be compared to the cliff notes series they 'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with but no real depth most volumns are under 100 pages therefore do n't expect many man in the trenches stories this volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war and presented a bit better than most in the series	18

0	though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it 's the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction	18

1	charles h kahn 's account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion although less than 200 pages long is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality in a concise but intelligent summary kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn 's treatment \( or lack of \) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought but this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language	18

1	this is an extraordinary biography for while blumenson 's admiration for george patton is evident it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton 's personality both positive and negative the book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the general and far beyond the movie in exploring his character and motivations not an overly long book but thorough detailed and very enjoyable to read	18
1	for someone like myself that is new to selling and licensing art this book is so informative i am so glad that i bought it it is also a good reference book to keep on hand i recommend it	18
0	this simply is n't history in real life people do things for reasons historians explain what happened and \( to some extent \) why that is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts pappe gets plenty of facts wrong but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region this book is propaganda masquerading as history	18

0	blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund 's other books \( boy culture \) he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper if you like this writing style rettenmund 's books may be for you personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters	18
0	i did not find this book very helpful there is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to quot invest quot in \( it seems the pricier the better and i mean several hundred dollars i actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands \) and what kind of fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals i am not a professional chef just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple good tasting meals for my family the recipes here seem to be time consuming and complicated not much money to be saved here	18

0	obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed	18
0	i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena however i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me i disagree with the simplistic conclusion \( among others \) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china	18

0	many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm 's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate \? someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read	18

0	i bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me however the information provided is too extensive and confusing listing far too many points in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them the body map listing them is in the first part of the book so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to i also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous the way this system originated is also a little murky this is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public	18
1	practical sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it 's extremely dry the author 's writing is much more engaging in his followup and that 's a much faster read in addition to offering some practical tips the millionaire next door also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry 's money secrets a book called maybe life 's just not that into you and something from andy borowitz the name of which escapes me if you have to choose between the millionaire next door and the millionaire mind go with the latter	18

1	neverwhere is one of gaiman 's best yet ! i highly recommend this novel	18
1	this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to quot the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society quot but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results	18

1	angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5 star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman she focuses entirely on the black power movement in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves	18
0	at first glance this is a great book however once you 've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children 's books as well \? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however	18

0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
0	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer this book will provide lots of information it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog but for my taste i found the photographic results to be uninspiring too much posing too much portraiture lighting not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is	18

1	i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless i think it easily earns 4 5 5 stars it is over a decade old now and i do n't think it is intended as a source for scholars of english but for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read i ca n't compete with some of the above reviewer 's scholarly points but i do n't think replacing some of bryson 's dogma with their own is worthwhile mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational bryson 's dictionary of troublesome words is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me	18

0	this book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the sierra club it 's more of a philosophy book than a quot how to quot book if anyone wants to learn how to backpack and or camp he would be better advised to buy the several books by karen berger and chris townsend in particular the backpackers handbook	18

0	watson and crick pilfered the data of rosalind franklin \( unbeknownst to her \) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double helix nature of dna instead of acknowledging her with praise watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working \( ie a woman working in male dominated science n the 1950 's \) a classic case of reaction formation maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships	18

0	the content of this book is adequate but the layout leaves much to be desired the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents pages are not labeled with chapter information such as which chapter that page belongs to the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book i would rate it much higher	18

1	this book captures the human spirit at both its best and its worst schwarz bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy from birth and on he also shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man although without them humanity would crumble as future readers will find out their importance and if there really are just men in our world we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders	18

0	all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture the reader longs for the pair to actually do something in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones now i know why	18
0	easily the worst textbook i encountered during my undergraduate years unfocused sparse and almost completely lacking example problems riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life i'm not a big fan of the book by seborg et al either but if you have to choose between the two go with seborg	18

1	this is a highly informative and accurate book it presents the data in a clear and graphic form with a minimum of statistical manipulation the studies cited by the previous reviewer lloyd rowsey are based on econometric modeling since the one he mentions two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results one is by ted joyce the other by john lott and john whitney econometric modeling can prove anything if you want to understand crime in america in the 1990s buy the crime drop	18
0	while it 's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone	18

1	excellent as the title states the ultimate should be the first book purchased borrowed or stolen for the enthusiast	18
0	although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me	18
1	almost everyone you meet is having trouble with a relationship this book by charles swindoll is a wonderful tool to assist people to build better relationships from my own person experience i have come to conclude that the larger part of relationship problems are caused by lack of communacation in this book charles talks about how to be open in a relationship and the value of trust not only in a personal relationship but also in the church a wonderful must read	18

1	the author not only argues for feminism but she does so in a unique manner and innovative approach by arguing for feminism across borders she compares and defines literary and national borders this book is extremely thorough on all aspects of chicana feminist writing available by engaging historical theories as well as contemporary notions to really grasp the experience the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth substance truth and validity	18

1	this is a great book i love it and its very interesting ! great information and pricing	18
0	i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller goes to show you some people have really bad taste the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog it seems like the author was being paid by the word too much repetition entire scenes which added nothing to the story etc i would never purchase another book by this author glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can charli	18
0	i found this book vacuous and jejune and frankly i met the author \( without knowing who he was \) and he tried to pick me up and i 've never heard such a pile of cr in my life and i'm not even close to beautiful so good luck with his advise	18
1	pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees but what he thinks about the most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image and jerry thompson 's exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in truth and photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences	18
1	i would recomend this book to anyone it is fantastic and funny it made me laugh it really took my imagination on an adventure you really need to read this book	18
1	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy although the book is considered an educational read i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well it 's just an interesting book it doesnt get much simpler than that	18
0	i agree with the last reader i did n't finish this book it was so boring nothing happened and the characters were annoying i read a lot of books that are n't action oriented and like them but this one was awful	18

0	nothing in this book was usable for me okay very little if i was trying to write the next ethan frome then this book would be perfect instead i write sci fi and fantasy i was looking for tips to improve my description of things this book recommends describing different things too much emphasis on metaphor \( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious \) if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate this book might be a waste of your time however poets and pure literary writers might find it more useful than i did	18
0	all the reviews so far sound like personal friends of b w who are puffing the book the book is simple and would require more information so why not just go buy a book with more information	18

1	i am a prekindergarten teacher this book is a favorite of all of my students both boys and girls the story has an important moral that all children can learn from the moral is to be yourself and that you do not need to copy others stephanie not only does her own thing but stands up for herself this story gives children the courage to stand up for themselves and to be an individual	18
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	18
0	i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great i decided i wanted another for work so i ordered another one i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the preset weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled they sent me a replacement and it too is off station at this point i'm wondering if the first one i got was the exception i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am fm radio that part works great this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first !	19
0	the dvds are a rip off although i'm counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i 'd recommend verbatim 's dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i have n't submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments	19

0	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck	19
0	operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments poor battery life need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day needs mute function volume could be louder too i would wait and buy next generation	19
1	totally agree with the other reviewers' comments originally i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus even with shipping this is still cheaper \( by 5 bucks \) and its metal ! fyi if you do n't have any filters \( like i did n't \) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm \( circular polarizer uv protector and 812 warming len \) a good buy for the price i bought it because of the reviewers' comments and do n't regret it	19
1	i like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs just set back and relax your covered	19

1	received exactly what i ordered at a fair price	19
1	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case what i received is what i expected lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane other than that it was a good purchase for the price	19
1	plenty of room for my creative zen nano player ear buds and spare battery i only wish for something other than black ! it is easy to misplace	19
1	this is what you want top of the line never get lost again no more spat with your friends or others just get the magellan and you are on your way everyone should have one	19
0	reception is not that great with the stock rubber duck antenna and also the press to talk button and the channel changing buttons are way to close together making it awkward to use would not buy again	19
0	the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video besides this this is a good product for the ipods	19
0	my printing problems began two months after warranty expiration i tried every troubleshoot i could find three times what a beautiful machine it does everything very well it even looks great sitting there on the desk but what if it stops printing then what good is it \? i finally gave up and bought something else	19
0	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
1	i agree that these are not top of the line but they are n't bad at all i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for 2x in this case it takes longer but i get good results i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd i would buy these again updated on 7 3 2005 i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what so ever very happy with this product	19
1	i 've had this for about a week and it seems to be working very well the autoscan feature is very nice since i seemed to forget to switch between city and highway with my older units the voice prompts are very clear and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level i 've had several radar detectors over the years and this one certainly seems to be the best so far it is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles i found	19
1	i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing ! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go	19
1	this photo paper is truly top of the line profession grade paper i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints and they always turn out great	19
0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	19
0	the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do	19
0	while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players	19
1	great sound fun colored lights great design love this radio	19
1	i purchased this card a month ago i use it on my dell axim x3i so far it has been fully compatible fast and flawless i have n't owned another pda or sd card so i ca n't give you a first hand benchmark but i can say that accessing the card is quick and i have not had any skips while playing my music files the 256mb is good for the price if you wait for amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer 's rebate	19
1	i own the hp 475 and since it 's slightly larger then the rest the printer barely fits in the case it does fit but it is very tight i would not recommend this for the 475 probably i should n't have bought this but i really liked the case	19
1	great portability good picture for the price i like the fact that i can plug this player into any tv and play dvd 's and also take it in the car camping or anywhere i also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value	19
1	this is just great lots of storage for data files and pictures allows me to keep my file with me where ever i go no additonal software required just plug it in the usb port and you have instant files fast and easy to use small in size but big in storage i give it 5 stars	19
0	despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie 6 airlink 7db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you 're expecting 15db performance	19
1	not much to say here it works easily adjustable with just your feet feels good wearing socks	19
0	it works if there 's a direct line of sight to the reciever in other words if the ipod is lying down horizontally it wo n't respond you 'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work	19
0	i bought a 700 series iriver to use at the gym which came with this armband at first it was great but it did n't last there are two clasps which do n't sta attcked well and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use	19
0	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer	19
1	the item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices i e tv air purifier elec clock etc fortunately it has n't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced you have to turn it anumber of directions until you get the best reception then leave it in that position	19
1	i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me ! so far it does what it 's suppose to do i am pleased it 's a little clunky and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended we 'll see how it works in 6 months	19
1	this is my second iriver product the first one was fine but it could n't survive a trip through the washing machine this one works well is easy to navigate through good sound the case is rather cheap the other one was rigid plastic this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order all in all this is a great little mp3 player	19
1	great item powered off laptop its fans work quietly to keep laptop cool so you can actually us your lap without fear of overheating your computer an inexpensive solution to preventing costly repairs wish i'd purchased earlier as i already fried my cd dvd drive and had to replace them good product targus	19
1	it was easy to set up and use our remote was bad out of the box but panasonic sent us a replacement we were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old vhs over to dvd it took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the vhs tapes again to bring back memories	19
1	having a bad view of the southern sky i needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio it maded all the difference great product and it came with 30 ft of cable	19
1	love the wireless connection to my hp all in one scanner printer works great	19
1	bought this player for its size \( sports \) and its napster compatibility updated the firmware after having a rocky start but things seem a little more stable now also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods \( around 0 degrees celsius \) odd behaviour but mostly ok now that we are in the spring teens again have n't found a case yet to protect from sweat interface is what i expected dead simple no complaints for the price	19
0	the paper stripes of 1 4 are too wide at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear if somebody is really after information he should n't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper	19
1	i am new to this type of device but it has performed as expected	19
0	what more can i say than the above \? it is flimsy does n't stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot do n't waste your money this thing is junk it would be more appropriately priced at 5 00	19
0	7 out of the 25 disks would not write i didnt much care for the product considering this factor	19
1	i got this monitor along with a keyboard when i get home i plug my laptop into both and i have a huge screen to do my work on the colors are terrific the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen wish i had done this a long time ago	19
0	this cable looks nice when you do n't linger on a digital channel what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight the next day it will be a split screen mode showing double image of the broadcast to fix it i have to change it to a non digital channel and switch it back i guess it is possible that it is the cable box but nothing happens like that on the component outputs	19
1	this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works greatsmallconvienientbad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wronghas to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way	19
1	it works very well it 's nice to be able to listen to cd 's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed my only problem is that the cd player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent this happens rarely but it 's enough to be a little annoying other than that it 's a very nice product no skipping easy to use and a fair price	19
1	i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it 's category	19
1	i love my 2 gb sd memory card i use it all the time and have had no problems with it	19
0	this item is an all around piece of garbage after about 3 months of light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode i sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode do n't buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the garbage alley i would n't even give this to a bum because i would feel bad about it	19
0	product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web in addition no all region code supportted ! i will return it asap	19
1	the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off	19
1	i 've had a ge and a sony \( cd543rm \) kitchen under counter units i 've also tested a few others in stores the sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the sony 553 is superior to the sony 543 the 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and am fm reception	19
1	outstanding product ! keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 usb ports	19
0	claiming that this fan 's 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still does n't move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	19
1	this is my first experience with hdtv and wide screen this 46 sony tv is excellent with hd programs with regular broadcasts it is a bit muddy but that is the fault of the signal not the tv i am very pleased with the overall quality of the set i had the set professionally installed and set up and i am sure glad i did install and set up are not for amateurs like me if anything ever happens i will be hard pressed to reset things sony 's instruction manuals are not that great	19
0	for those considering the purchase of this unit keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your tv menus and playlists will not the very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable is n't worth it get some 10 00 cables for your ipod and save mone	19
1	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin	19
1	i purchased the hawking hwu8dd on the recommendation of several other rvers wifi signals at rv parks tend to be unreliable until now the built in antenna on my laptop could see the signal at my park but could not access it as soon as i installed the software and connected the hawking antenna via usb port i immediately accessed my campground 's signal the hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me	19
1	this is a great product for those who probably do n't write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally	19
0	really wo n't use the tv but the cd only lasted 5 days and i use it everyday had to buy something else	19
0	the cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic the cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use so i called coby they said i 'd have to pay them to send me a replacement ! my advice do n't bother buying coby	19
1	i bought this switch last week the installation was as easy as plug n play no major problems so far this switch is worth its price	19
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over 6 00 amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !	19
1	i have been using memorex dvd r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player recorder not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this 50 pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many dvd r blank media i found memorex dvd r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance	19
1	i am extrememly happy with this one for the price it delivers well the voice recorder works well my key need was to record lectures and listening to them worked out very well	19
0	with no mode settings \( repeat shuffle etc \) or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you	19
1	i used these speakers \( 4 \) as part of my 7 1 channel theater and i used the hti 55 center channel plus the hti 8 ceiling to finish off my system i have a denon 2307ci pumping these speakers and let me tell you i ca n't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers rock my entire house from the basement ! ! ! these are the best in wall speakers i have ever bought ! ! ! ! buy them now before they 're all gone ! highly recommend	19
0	please do n't be fooled by it 's inexpensiveness i am a victim of it i already bought this card and within 2 weeks i started getting read and write errors i formatted the card and it now has 2 mb of bad sectors unlike the other reviewer i did had 2 gb to begin with but i think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap it is not at all reliable now i am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me	19
0	my friend has this cord to connect his ipod to his stereo and it works great great sound good ease of use etc i wanted one so i went to bestbuy today and got one by rca that sounds just as good for 7 99	19
0	disaster supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but will not work with other desk phones ! it only works with cordless phones i wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset we were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones no mention of the hold 'music' in the manual this product is a mess stay away get a real phone system	19
0	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it as you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of non functional when it comes to many small files i had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing stay away or if you really want one buy mine please	19
0	not at all what i wanted it is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you do n't want them pushed ordered 2 and plan to return them i usually do n't even bother to write a bad review i just do n't write one but in this case i 'll make an exception yuk ! actually i rate it at a 0 but there was no 0 selection	19
0	i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6db on the box the performance was worse than the original 2db antenna that came with my wireless adapter back it goes	19
0	bought 4 ! they do n't work the batteries do not last we are trying to return them	19
1	i am very pleased with this item it is fits comfortably holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id keys extra batteries cd 's	19
1	seems sturdy however it did not fit my tv will not fit samsung lns 4692d	19
1	i bought this because i needed good phones without the extra bulk they 're really lightweight but not flimsy they have very good sound quality i really like the volume control on the headphones themselves it gives me the extra level of control all in all a really good bang for your buck	19

1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
0	i paid 35 for a barely adequate product case it does not securely mount or protect the creative zen it is overpriced and underperforms as others have mentioned you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player the set up feature is a joke you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product the design engineer should be fired do not buy this is jun	19
0	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19
1	if only other computer products were this easy to set up and use highly recommend this product	19
0	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p o s ! !	19

1	use original epson brand ink the heads in the epson printers it 's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer	19
1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot it is also silent and convenient it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable it was no problem to reformat to ntfs	19
1	these boxes are half the size of regular cases just right not too bulky like the regular ones	19
0	i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements \( in place of the rebate checks \) the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	19
0	i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it 's going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again do n't buy	19

1	this memory card works great with my 15 powermac laptop i 've had a noticeable increase in speed with no hitches	19
1	yep everything is very cool clarity etc but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop it is just dancing while i keep it on laptop	19
0	i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon and i advised them why the thx 800 cable is not blue the thx 600 cable is blue i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support they said they have never made a thx 800 cable in blue amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue	19
0	i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about 20 of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270 this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda	19
1	do n't let the size fool you i do n't know much about audio yet but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using much crisper with out all the fuzziness and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending i am sure the 600 mic is great but this is doing every thing i need	19
0	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
1	great memory card for the price i would highly recommen	19
1	came quickly and was exactly as offered i am completly satisfie	19
0	this was ok for the money decent sound quality however it died on me after just 2 months of use the usb drive still works \( sometimes \) but the built in player no longer works i found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use	19
0	i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player does n't work it 's essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point	19
1	i 've had this device for two years just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry \( not on purpose \) the thing still works ! ! i will not however try sending it into the dryer though beause i'm pretty sure that would fry this thing	19

0	purchased for my daughter an english teacher scrabble lover she said she 'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she 'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game she said it would end up on a shelf in her house she 'd rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary i returned the franklin she did n't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class	19
1	i purchase this on amazon for 499 no tax free shipping you can not match this quality at this price the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color i looked at samsung for 800 and i am glad i saved myself 300 with this lcd	19
1	very nice player hdmi works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy blue light lets you see the disc 's and looks very cool 1080i with upscaling on all my dvds	19

1	plenty of room for our hpa612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her hpa617 pockets for extra paper shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer	19
0	it was very bright at first then button began malfunctioning i emailed customer service and never heard back do n't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button	19
1	the only reason i did n't give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once so as of yet i ca n't call it a worthy 'road warrior ' however it is certainly a great case proportioned well and good design with space for essentials would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 widescreen notebook	19
1	just wanted to echo what others have said that these batteries seem to really last i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it almost as powerful as the 2500s here and the batteries ran out after a few hours replaced those batteries with these and these just seem to last on and on am very happy with them	19
1	my panasonic rv31k is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when i first took it out of the box panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon if this player ever dies \( cross my fingers \) i will get another panasonic i choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions co	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
1	these dvds are probably the highest quality and most reliable that i have tried and given their low price what is there not to like \? i would recommend these to just about anyone	19
0	this is an excellent item for anyone on the go who has an ipod nano no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano	19
1	this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly	19
0	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner so if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one	19
0	i use to love maxtor still have one from 1999 so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers well the darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone i did have a lot of it backed up but still what a pain now that seagate owns them spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive or get a couple of these and raid them but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping	19
0	have a second generation ipod \? if so this is not the product for you after buying my new green ipod i needed something to protect it so i bought the speck nano skintight delux with holster it just did n't fit it i tried but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off do n't do this i sugest making sure the product detail includes the second generation	19
1	if you own a canon digital camera this printer is great it is portable and makes great prints people think they are from a photolab it is also vey easy to use i have seen other mini printers from olympus and sony and they are not as good they cost more too	19
1	basically this backpack is all that i need in a back pack very well padded very roomy fits an hp pavillion dv8000 17 laptop its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear definately worth the unlike my previous packpacks the straps adjust so quickly and easily that i adjust them every time i put the pack on or take it off great product ! ! !	19

0	along with reception of new hd stations i expected high quality fm am to go with my complete top line stereo system instead the hdt 1 gives me very poor quality even less than a table top clock radio very high output can only turn amp up to lowest level and painful to listen to no response to inquiries from sangean	19
0	i bought it and usb was fine but the firewire ports did n't work lost time and money sending it in for warranty service	19
1	i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice	19
1	this is about the only mouse i buy have gone through a couple of them in the past few years i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using if you want a good reliable comfortable mouse this logitech is a good choice	19

0	i have this radio and it 's a pos remote is n't very responsive and the display is waaaay too bright \( will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person \) and the user interface is terrible the thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced ipod type radio on websites they are trying to get rid of it because it s cks ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	this 23 lcd hdtv has excellent image quality and looks really stylish too it also comes with hdmi so you can hook up the latest hd video source such as hd dvd or blue ray hi def dvd players the lcd panel itself displays vivid evenly lit images and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model i personally ended up opting for the sharp ld 23sh1u hdtv lcd monitor because the sharp works as pc mac monitor \( plus j r started offering a rebate \) but i think this panasonic is a great choice too no doubt about that	19
1	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it the sound is great and the amplifier works well for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar	19

0	very disappointing ! i was hoping i could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate vhf stations instead the best the antenna could pull in was color enhanced snow and sound laced with static tried all three antenna hook up options in fact my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna	19
0	i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i would n't even use this for a notebook	19
1	this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case although it seems like i'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen do n't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time though mr clean magic eraser works well for that but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard	19
1	it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning using the item \( i put it back on but fell off a couple more times \) i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well	19
0	this tv only worked for three weeks then for no apparant reason it suddenly would not turn on i sent it back to coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it no one should by from coby	19

1	the other effusive reviews are spot on the picture is fabulous on new dvds \( lord of the rings nemo harry potter \) a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony kdf 42e2000 42 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies \( some like it hot the king and i \) stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips	19

0	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i'm very disappointed and i'm returning it	19
1	nothing much to comment about on an ink cartridge it works as it should if they could only reduce the cost of these things then i would be impressed	19
1	the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool that will give up some room for future overclocking overall i would highly recommend the processor by applying for their credit card i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising about 170 00 with free shipping and no tax everyone else was 200 230 for the same processor it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon	19
1	i 've never had any problems with memorex dvd 's or cd 's when i was ordering and read some of the reviews here i had to go back and look at what i was using to make sure i 've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones i do n't know why some users are having problems but these dvd 's always worked great for me and i record on average over one a day	19
0	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic definently not worth the 15 i paided for them	19
1	when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it !	19
0	i just purchased this item now i'm planning to return it tomorrow one of the advertised features the ability to store liner notes just does n't work properly they just do n't into the pocket without bending and or forcing them in to me the liner notes have value and i'm not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet	19
1	they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably wo n't cut the cheese	19
0	what were they thinking \? or are they thinking at all \? sonic stage is a piece of crap it freezes hangs and very very user friendly \? \? \? \? since you need their software to load the music i would stay away from this player as far away as possible pros nice sound quality cons everything else my recommendation is go for creative usb players it 's very good quality and better battary life with creative players you just drag and drop files and you done with it i see why sony is failing in mp3 players market	19
0	very very not user friendly no instruction to install worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house decided to resell it could be its only because i'm apple illeterate	19
0	does not consistently work ! i have a toshiba a15 \( win xp pro \) and sometimes this works but usually it does n't lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver but lately it 's just been giving me a blue screen i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues d link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver ! bad customer service ! i will never buy a d link product again ! !	19
0	i ordered the unit twice and twice i received a carrying case not the adapter i returned both and ordered direct from cobra when i had called customer support for amazon the second time i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says	19
1	a great addition to the ih5 radio ! you could do without it but being able to adjust volume from across my apartment is a great feature	19
1	always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year	19
0	i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g4 it worked the very first time but after a restart it no longer worked was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again it was fruitless so i dont recommend this product as i'm truly upset with its performance	19

1	seems pretty good doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your c drive into it	19
1	recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one there is n't really anything special about this receiver but it a solid one the two year warranty tells me they stand by their product in case of a problem \( hopefully i wo n't need to use the warranty \) it gives good clean power and sound do n't let the 75w channel fool you this is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power time will tell however how well this receiver performs also for the price amazon was selling for i could n't pass it up	19
1	this is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages it works well with heavier \( cardstock \) paper it also prints great photos i have a mac i book i also use the print shop 2 program with it it gives me great versatility with my pages photos	19
1	i do n't know what was wrong w the other reviewers machine but let me assure you this is not an inferior product i got it on clearance target for 69 98 i have been looking for a long time for a good portable dvd player i have used it and had no problems with it whatsoever plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to target good deal all around highly reccomended	19
1	i have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints one of my laptops only has a usb 1 x port and it is incredibly slower for backups that has no reflection on this product but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have usb 2 x and do n't blame it on this drive	19
1	i purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up this mic was inexpensive and works fine so far we have n't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time	19
0	i bought 2 of these drives to set up a raid1 array \( mirror \) and one of them continuously has errors causing the array to be degraded i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid big let down i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more	19

1	i already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers the speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled the mounts are solid and can be oriented in any direction easily i am about to by three more for my center and two fronts i highly recommend	19
1	i 've had this printer for four years i print approximately 25 documents each week this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge it 's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time too compared to ink jet printers that i have had i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets great buy	19
1	i bought these as a gift for my husband to watch tv late at night without disturbing me he loves them the sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable	19
1	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially but when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network there really were n't any issues just following the directions \( and avoiding the easysecure option \) worked fine i would highly recommend this printer the quality of the printing is excellent the feature function set is quite high for a moderate price and it 's a great home office printer that has lots to offer	19
1	i'm so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny ! very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i do n't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool	19
0	i love the saitek 880 wired gamepad so i figured the wireless would be that much better unfortunately my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems there 's nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out i bought this and the batteries died i sent saitek an e mail and they sent me two new ones great they worked ! then they died soon after hopefully their new wireless which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues however this one 's a dud	19
0	i 've had these speakers for three years now hissing popping not holding signal all that has been true from day 1 and tonight one of the speakers just would not turn on the power supply was n't the problem it 's something inside the speaker box and something that apparently cannot be fixed so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution oh well	19
0	4 months into it and it stops playing jams up and i ca n't remove the cassette or any or the cd 's wo n't ever but pioneer again	19
0	when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di 624 router i wasted my money buying this device it 's useless and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop	19
1	one warning for users with over head lights the 6000 keyboard that has tranparent \( light gray \) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right i have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear go for a black key or similar model	19
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player but after the first week the earphone input \( hole in the player \) did n't hold the input jack securely resulting in no sound i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second but could not get it to work continuously unfortunately i threw away my receipt and box or i would return it	19
1	a great product snug fit on the laptop and appears to be a part of the laptop itself difficult to remove but no real reason to remove it anyway	19
0	the price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item but after only about 1 000 pictures all i got was corrupted data i had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera it definitely showed the card was the problem luckily i had recently done a download wo n't trust my pictures to this brand again	19
0	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality	19
0	this product has a known defect for serial numbers r641 and less \( see logitech website \) i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r635 it will be sent back tomorrow hopefully amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base	19
1	this is a very nice tv for the money great picture and with the built in dvd player that plays cd 's i was able to remove a big old crt tv dvd player and stereo from the bedroom i'm happy with my choice	19
1	i was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality \( colour and clarity \) over the standard playstation cable anyone with an s video input should consider making this simple upgrade	19
1	we received this item very quickly it was exactly what we ordere	19
0	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	19
0	returned it would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients \( note the product does n't advertise support for mac \) why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers	19
0	i ca n't say the reason but this card blocks all the time after some days without use for unblock it i have to take it out many times and clean contacts then without knowing exactly what worked it begins to function	19
1	this mount is perfect ! it sticks well to the windshield keeps the gps rock steady it allows you to swing to driver center and passenger 's views and back without any bending or remounting i am very pleased ! my roadmate looks a 100 better on this mount i hated the mount that came with the gps the build quality of this mount also seems to be very good i would highly recomend this mount	19
0	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges if any of them is out of ink you ca n't print at all if you 're out of yellow ink you still cannot print a purely black white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that	19
1	garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to this option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the gps now if only the software was smart about how and when to use the sensor	19
1	i purchased this for my teenager to use with her ipod nano i shopped around for a while before i finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly i 've only had it for a month but it 's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far	19
1	i bought it for my canon s3 is first i tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems then i did the suggested format by canon and it worked the same perfect fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera have n't any problem of corruption i 've been tempted to buy another one	19
0	they listed the 49x and they shipped the 49a \( standard capacity \) so like everyone else who bought this product it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get you may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around	19
1	makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands only thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier	19
0	the unit was 20ft from the receiver in the same room in direct view of eachother tivo would n't connect	19
1	this tv monitor rocks ! ! i 've been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office this lcd does both very well i'm writing this review with the lns4696d installed and everything on the screen is very large \( what i wanted \) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than i expected ! ! \( hint sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode \)	19
0	this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods	19
1	this is a good compact flash card this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive	19
0	this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	19
1	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product	19
1	i'm so happy with these speakers for the price the sound is utterly amazing i have a good moderately priced system and these speakers really make it special no one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such humble looking speakers	19
1	muy pero muy bueno es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira	19
0	as the other reviewer found out these cards ca n't be formatted to work with sd audio total waste of money	19
1	this is a great product for your mini the armband is well constructed from a neoprene type material \( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty \) with heavy duty velcro all the way around and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance this is n't a super cheap armband but as they say you \( usually \) get what you pay for this should last you for years of gymming running biking	19
0	why pay 46 75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer \( impact \) for only 19 95 at b h photo and video i have both the the dl 150 pentax battery that came with the camera and the impact imdl150 i ca n't tell any difference between them other than the price camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices	19

0	i had my pink ipod mini since feb 2005 it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it and the warranty ran out i got it repaired at an apple reseller and then it died again on the warranty expiration date what is it with the ipods \? it 's like they have a self destruct inside ! \)	19
0	sure these floppy's are inexpensive they arrived on time thanks amazon ! ! ! ! ! but the photo doesn't give it any credit these don't come with a plastic carrying case like the photo just a crappy cardboard box ! come on guys wheres the plastic case for these things now they will be flopping all over the place in my desk drawers etc	19

1	i have and have had lots of sw radios including a number of sonys this is one of their many gems great perfomance lots of memories and snazzy look good for travel \( certainly not as compact as the sw100 of course \) a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio and do n't want to spend very much good for listening and good for dxing while traveling look no further	19
0	this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke \( said there were no cd 's inside \) after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too	19
1	this is truly the best wifi you can get on the market right now its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1 most importantly i 've had the best gaming experience ever now i can host games on xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun the linksys wrt330n wireless n gigabit gaming router is well worth its money and a great investment i recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great wifi for whatever reason	19
1	i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that was n't too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it 's not terribly sturdy maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it 's in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too	19
1	i do n't bother charging my zune from the computer any more this is the only way to go	19
0	maybe mine was broken but i do n't think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter	19
1	contrary to popular belief i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support a few random disconnects but overall a great product	19
1	easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers	19
1	i want the dvds i'm making to last to as close to forever as possible so i did a lot of research before deciding what dvds to buy verbatim came out as 1 for durability i chose the dvd r format for maximum compatibility with various devices and i 've only had a few errors after burning about 75 dvds amazon 's sale price for these was great if you 're just looking for short term backup media i'm sure you can find cheaper but these are a different class of dvds	19

0	this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it	19
1	very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use before purchasing i did believe that these were noise canceling however that is not the case the foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that i am very satisfied with the result replacement foam inserts must be purchased online	19
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for 7 10 bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 25	19

1	this pny 2 0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife 's canon powershot s 900 elph to replace smaller memory cards although 1gb cards worked adequately with the elph we noticed early on that its 10 0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card the 2 0gb holds many more photos \( over 400 shots and counting \) than the 1gb at half the price of other brands the pny is proving to be very satisfactory \( we purchased two 2 0s at once \) we happily recommend the pny 2 0gb photo card for your photos it makes a great gift candidate get yours soon !	19

1	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time it 's small rugged and light so it 's easy to pack	19

1	the bci 3ebk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer i have used this ink for a couple of years now and do n't recall it smudging on the pages i print the price on this product \( compared to hp products \) is fair but i am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink of course you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text	19

1	buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer	19
0	for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children \? it 's going back	19
1	a very good product but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself howard rules !	19
0	had to give it one star because there is nothing lower this printer was the answer to my printing dreams for about three months with light home use only fault at that time is it is loud it will wake the dead which is ok since the dead do n't have to print things that often this is the perfect printer for them other than noise a faulty load paper error kept coming up then the paper load went bad it is very unreliable and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop tonight i'm trashing it buying another printer tonight ! do not waste your money on this piece of trash	19

0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and would n't do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	19
0	other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms907 you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms 40 wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one	19
0	this product is not worth the money or trouble i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up save your money and do n't buy this this would actually qualify for a zero star rating	19

0	being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print 500 pages per month 50 100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition	19

1	i bought this cute little speaker from walmart \( 14 \) and it is so compact and very useful it also matches with my other speakers of sony dream system this has 4 usb ports \( so good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pc sitiing down the table \) they are lighted so that you can plug them in even night speaker is good quality and it has one usb connection and one dc connection quality of sound is good if not excellent overall it is a great buy for the price	19
0	i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability there 's nothing convenient about its need for 2 usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging if you 're reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for 2 free ports amazon 's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports boooo seagate i'm offended that you 're offering such clumsy connectivity	19
1	right price and works off of usb ! the sound is terrible on macbook so this will fill in nicely	19

0	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money 's worth	19

1	i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	19

0	besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my 4 port kvm stopped functioning after six months there 's no information on the web to help either it 's as if there is no way to fix a kvm that does n't work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin 's website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin does n't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin 's without cables	19

1	my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality	20
0	i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots do n't line up just right the mug will not work i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation	20
0	i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we 'll have to live with the damage it 's a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time	20
1	my cats love this ! they will play with it by themselves or with each other it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat but he still loves to play on it	20
0	although this item 's description says it is made of commercial quality stainless steel it arrived with several rust spots so much for whatever commercial quality stainless steel means also be aware that the handles are not round but are u shaped it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush on the positive side the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips however on the whole i would not recommend these locking tongs	20
1	i recently upgraded to this machine i had an antique white that only sewed straight and zigzag imagine my pleasure at having a machine that can make 48 different stitches ! i'm very happy with the product you ca n't go wrong with a singer product	20
0	this electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last five electric blankets we have purchased however it stopped working within a month like the other four who makes a realiable electric blanket \? not sunbeam and not this brand since the texture on this one is nice we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket	20
1	great item just what i needed the price was fine and the company reputation was a serious consideration in my selection	20
1	our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs	20
0	saw the other review and had to share my similar experience the glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing it 's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings i have to return it because i know will get angry every time i pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess	20
1	this soup pot is an excellent addition to any cook 's set of tools using this pot there 's no need to saute meats of veggies in one place and then transfer them to an ovenproof pot to finish it goes easily from stovetop or oven to the table and is compatible with almost any dinnerware can you tell i really like my new soup pot	20
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery i opened the box to check the bowls everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present	20
0	the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good	20
1	overall this is a very nice item i have been using it to make mojitos and it works wonderfully the only negative thing i have to say about it is the handle could be longer	20
1	superior product great tasting expresso \( rivals starbucks \) and very reliable i have owned the granos for about 6 months and have found it to be a pleasure it is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso the style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests if you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte i ca n't recommend the granos more highly i plan to buy another for my office	20
1	i like a big mug of coffee and the senseo coffee maker just does not have that much room under the spout my tall mugs do n't fit but these do perfectly just a note for fellow senseo lovers	20
1	this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble ! this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 's fit just fine ! this shoe rack is perfect i highly reccomend it !	20
1	my three cats adore this playpen just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease they also love snuggling in the bed together \( 2 cats fit at a time \) my only complaint is that i ca n't find the replacement teases they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non catnip styles the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i ca n't find them at petco 's online store i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find	20
1	buy some rechargable batteries \( 4 aa 's \) and you 're set ! this fan has saved me time and time again at work when a hot flash hits just having some airflow around my face seems to help it 's not a whirlwind but just enough	20
1	if you like fondue you 'll like raclette as much or even more use your imagination do n't stick with what is traditional you can use your raclette for desert pizza breakfast and much more ! traditionally served with steamed red potatoes this will satisfy the meat and potatoe man in the group marinade the meat with different flavors to add some spice do n't forget the vegetables slice onion red peppers mushrooms romas and even pineapple it 's a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot	20
0	ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot \? \? now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot ! now i know that they are not supposed to be like this ! ! ! do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk ! ! ! ! ! on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours ! ! ! ! i am trashing mine today ! !	20
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out it was wonderful wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one i bought this item i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it i was suspect when i opened it poor quality material poor bed fit very very warm on the lowest setting after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires which are quite large in my ribs it had to come off i had rather be cold and i hate being cold	20
1	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20
0	this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk	20
0	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	i ca n't believe i spent good money on this vacuum i 've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems why it wo n't vacuum without pushing it with all my might why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children why the filter wo n't stay in place and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it i have replaced every filter and belt now i am going to throw it away i 'd gladly give it to charity but i ca n't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim	20
1	i bought this for my two classic revere ware 2qt pots \( marked clinton ill \) and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces all of today 's revere ware including this lid are made overseas the pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel but this glass lid works fine	20
1	just got it as a add on to an order and found that my cats really liked it all you have to do is open the bag and they come a runnin	20
1	the pot rack was just the right size and color it looks great in my kitchen without creating a barrier between my kitchen and dining room i love how easy it was to hang and the number of links provided with it mean that it can hang really low if i want this is just perfect for my kitchen	20
1	i am extremely pleased with the anolon cookware set it cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully many of my friends recommended this set and i'm glad to have taken their advice and made the purchase	20
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no frills straight lined attractive furniture it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set i love it ! and the price is right too	20
1	the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material	20
1	i purchased this for my niece who was pregnant at the time she started using it right away she said she feels like the last two trimesters were the easiest and gives credit to feeling healthier since using this juicer she said it 's very user friendly and easy to clean up	20
0	the blender i received also smelled as if it was overheating and the tachometer did not work i am sending it back and will be asking for a refund this clearly is not a reliable blender	20
0	i had this blender for 3 4 years and was very unhappy with it the design is poor \( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured \) the motor seems weak and it is hard to clean food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable today after only sporadic medium duty use over the few years i had it my blender outright died i have other cuisinart products that perform very well but this blender is a loser	20
0	the heater works fine but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period i will not buy an oil filled heater again	20
0	these covers are not even close to being red the are wine or burgundy in color	20
1	the sheets matched perfectly with my room which is the main reason i purchased them the quality is great ! the sheets are very soft and the colors are amazing i would recommend this product to anyone the reversability is also a nice luxury it was a wonderul purchase	20
1	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special	20
1	i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity cost and excellent coffee this has all three ! the first two or three times i tried this the coffee did n't come out that good either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day the other good news i 've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress	20
1	this knife has made me eat more vegetables just because it 's so much fun to chop carrots i was a little concerned with the handle at first but it 's very comfortable and is n't slick at all even in soapy water i also worried that maybe i should have gotten the bigger version of this knife again my fears were unfounded as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation you ca n't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job but if you 've ever had that feeling you already know how you 'll feel using a global when i slice carrots for snacks they come out as perfect translucent discs any vegetable i 've cut has been a joy	20
0	unsatisfied never received the item waited 8 wks before canceling order purchased item at macy'	20
1	delighted with them an franciscan apple collectors delight nice air tight lids	20
1	i only ordered these because they were only 9 99 for the whole set i do n't think they are nice enough to serve to your guests but i 'd use them on the weekend when i have brunch with my husband	20
0	i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i 'd buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one	20
0	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon this is by visiondecor furniture first it shows up on the curbside in pieces did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together \? this is not including the cushions the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy i do n't know if it will last a year ikea furniture is actually better quality paid around 550 with shipping if she would have spent another 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles she is very disappointed and wants to cry sad very sad	20
0	i ordered some replacement batteries and was told that they would be here last wednesday it is now thursday of the next week i have emailed them and told them to email me or call me to let me know where my package is and to no affail no call i will never order from petsafe again ! !	20
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	these rings are much too big and too lightly made for egg muffins and the eggs spill out the bottom of the rings total junk don't waste your money on these ring	20
1	i'm glad we went back to braun for a coffee maker tried a few others but they were n't as good braun makes a hot good cup of java faster than most i do wish they would go back to the 12 cup pot	20
1	aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4' setting it 's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it 's warmed up \( keep it closed \) i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do sure they occasionally stick and i do n't always get the batter in right and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it 's on but this is n't a 100 device it 's just a nice little waffle maker	20
0	the stainless steel lid has a glued in plastic piece that is supposed to provide an airtight seal to the canister my canister arrived with the plastic piece no longer glued in place i expected a bit more from a 50 coffee canister i'm returning it and going in search of a quality canister	20
1	this is a good bat house but does n't come with a pole i would recomend buying a pole or just hanging it somewhere	20
1	it is very light and worm i love it definitely worth the price !	20
1	i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps currently they 're working on chewing up the shelves so i'm off to buy one that 's entirely wire wish i had done that in the first place	20
0	this is not made in france most of the le creuset line is from a centuries old factory in france this pot is not when i saw where it was made i returned it buyer beware	20
1	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning we 've experienced neither of these make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great highly recommended	20
0	i returned eureka 437az back to amazon i was very dissapointed when i 've tried to vacuum my room the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical the only difference being color and hepa filter another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean	20
0	sigh was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's warning doh ! oh well live and learn live and learn refund please	20
1	i just tried this out for the first time and i was impressed it baked evenly and nicely best of all the cake came right out i simply sprayed it lightly with non stick spray and baked due the flexibility of this product you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability i will be buying more from this line	20
1	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well	20
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase the quality is as described and i will buy more !	20
1	i'm certainly glad to have this pointer you 'd never know it is inexpensive since it looks quite sleek \( like a fountain pen though heavier for sure \) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance pleasantly sensitive to the touch it needs no fussing you 'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model	20
0	although its description said it is a replacement carafe also for a different model for which i bought it it did not fit at all i felt it a nuisance to return it so i did not return it but i certainly wasted the money i paid i was very unhappy	20
0	just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them	20
1	the stool is excellent quality looks good and works well the surprise is the weight very heavy	20
0	it works fine but my cat wo n't use it i was thrilled with the reviews i read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived unfortunately i like it better than my cat does he largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass oh well before you buy make sure it 's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat this fountain has no water sound \( pretty quite actually \) i think that 's why my cat ignores it	20
1	these pans are great they are very sturdy and good quality do n't buy anything else ! trust me	20
0	okay there 's something wrong with brita filters they do n't always fit into the pitchers when i tilt the pitcher i can hear the filter shifting inside and yes i am aligning it properly it may filter out impurities contained in the tap water but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles i 've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month but darned if there is n't a problem with every single one ! do n't buy this look for another alternative	20
0	the humidifier started leaking after a few weeks in another website a few reviewers also had this problem the water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty very annoying ! ! the filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use it is also way too expensive	20
0	if this is in a jade or perhaps brick other earth colors let me know why waste everyone 's time with such a lame description	20
1	this bowl is very durable and i love the different colors that it comes in the bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times we basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream popcorn nachos etc i love these bowls and am going to buy a set of fiestaware for my mom	20
0	after remodelling our kitchen i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out when i saw the picture of the towel holder i thought it unique with its scroll work and would n't look like everything else i saw when i received it the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible i tried with no luck to remove the stains the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	20
0	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater	20
0	i got the expensive one rather than the 14 99 aroma cooker thinking it will be better quality wrong i only used it twice not only the rice get burn after i clean in and out of the cooker it still look dirty the quality of the material was really bad i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement do not waste your good earned money on this one	20
1	i love this filter ! it keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket silence was a key buying point for me as it was purchased for an aquarium in my bedroom this filter is absolutely silent so silent that i can now hear the hum of my fluorescent aquarium lights	20
0	my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker deliberately choosing one without a timer the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong right \? how can this company not even get the on off button right \? \? \? it 's so cheap when you push it the lighted button just pushes right in and does n't turn the coffeemaker off or on why did n't we keep the box and receipt so we could return it \? \? 20 down the draindon't buy this	20
1	i thought i would by this product just to try with my senseo machine and some coffee i brought from europe it works ! i also use it with my tea pods and got a great cup of tea i will buy more	20
1	this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem	20
1	i love this it keeps the bed toasty i takes some time to warm up the bed i turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour when i get it it 's very nice and i turn it down to 1 or 2 i find if i keep it on 5 all night i roast i do prefer this product to an electric blanket it has n't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills and it was worth the purchase price if you have a big pillowtop mattress the pad does n't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet otherwise i would have given the product 5 stars	20
1	i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion and they are n't expensive either therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use	20
0	i bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful it fell apart the first time we used it it even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood i do not recommend this product at all	20
1	we are really good about packing up our meat vegis and fruit right after purchase our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly the sealer came with rolls to make our own bags but i found it too cumbersome these bags eliminate the difficulty	20
1	well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic	20
0	i saw an ad for rabbit comparing it to reidel it is no reidel heavier than i expected and larger than i expected	20
0	i'm terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute does n't hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself	20
0	being lost without a timer for everything ! i purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features but the alarm is too soft i have hearing problems but even at a distance to 12 15 inches the alarm is easy to miss even my sharp eared children agree i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing a lesson learned for me	20
0	oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low i washed them once and they already shrank what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton after i dry with them i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric	20
1	plastic bowl seems like cheap plastic the motor is great as it puree and chops	20
0	while the water tasted better this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place	20
1	i bought this for my husband 's birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that do n't keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee	20
0	the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know thati would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop when using the wet mop it will leave water lines where i stop therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels when using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks ! i have not recommended this product to anyone a waste of 100 00	20
0	has to be seasoned just about everytime before use overwise great pan	20
1	i 've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32 and this works great ! i have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor this product lets me pick the length i need it 's metal materials makes it quite durable too hooray	20
1	yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it	20
0	beware ! on off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged the place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it 's been about 2 weeks	20
0	i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper i have washed it several times but it is still very rough also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed it was very cheaply made but my son does love it purely because its thomas i'm sure i would n't buy this again	20
1	i took a chance on ordering these and i'm glad i did they are heavy duty ! i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it 's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i 've also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great ! i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well !	20
1	both my fiance and i are very pleased with this warming mattress pad the dual settings work perfectly and the variety of heating intensities are excellent there is also extra emphasis on the feet a brilliant idea well worth the cost in my opinion	20
1	the flutes are absolutely great ! exactly what i wanted and even better than expected i will be purchasing more of these shortly	20
0	i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still have n't received this i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now wo n't get it until june 30th costumer service is ridiculous i was told it would take 3 5 days that 's why i ordered it don't get it if you need it within one yea	20
0	this toaster is more a decoration than anything else my kids eat a lot of bagels frozen waffles and this machine just does n't do the job without multiple toasting cycles even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle i also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place break off \( how \? \? it just sits on the counter no one is playing football with it ! \) i feel that i wasted 50 00 on this save your money	20
0	i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment ! ! they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on ! the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two do n't spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \? \)	20
0	do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service	20
1	we have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it it makes a great cup of coffee it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain then without any warning it stopped working i called hamilton beach and they are sending a free replacement no questions asked the unit has a hassle free 3 year warranty and it really was a snap we are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how hamilton beach stands behind their products	20
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	20
1	i ordered this four piece set and really like it the quality seems great and durable the color is defitely not white it is more of a light tan color but the price was too good compared to other sets i 've seen at pier 1 ect so i wo n't be retuning it just want you all to know it 's not white but very sturdy	20
1	i bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas i do n't think she has used it yet but i'm sure i did n't go wrong with a kitchenaid product i currently own the hand mixer and large mixer and love them both prices on amazon ca n't be beat	20
0	i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift	20

0	i was kind of disappointed with the black decker power mop it is to bottom heavey to flip the scrubbing brush easily you have to use two hands to flip the brush down and two hands to push the brush away i have already told friends do n't bother to spend 49 for this mop it is n't worth the money get a women to design this product i ca n't believe a women would have found this easy to use	20

0	this item is cheaply made and i sent it back the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left it plopped down to the left it could n't keep the right time	20

0	petmate makes a great fountain but their black model should be discontinued it is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it when i went to wash this fountain like i usually do every couple of weeks there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it i think the pump motor might have been leaking \( i'm not really sure \) if i had their white fountain i would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away	20

1	pros i have two chocolate labs therefore i have a lot of hair to deal with the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt \( wood floors \) it works alright on rugs cons not cheap loud the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you ca n't carry it you just have to roll it instead not a big deal	20
1	this cooks bacon crisp without any mess or spatter just place a couple of paper towels over the bacon i was using my george foreman grill but this is easier to clean	20
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully	20
1	i am very pleased with my new salad spinner it can hold a large amount of salad which means i do not have to reload and do the work over and over the mechanism is easy to use and works smoothly i am also able to soak the salad in icewater in it and then drain it and spin all in the same piece of equipment	20

1	i received this as a christmas gift i 've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you 're flying it 's the best way i 've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere	20
1	i was very pleased with how quick i received my purchase i had looked for a long time for bunny cake pan	20
0	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr electronics geek light sleeper it became a pretty big joke \( and embarassment for me \) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n' spell do n't bother buy the sound screens used in medical offices etc for half the price they 're so much better	20
0	i searched for what i thought would be a great dish rack this is without a doubt the worst product i have ever bought ! there is nothing stainless about this ! i have had it for only about 4 months and it is already rusting it was so not worth the money i paid for it i would not recommend buying this product	20

1	the pizzelle baker performed very well the batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good i recommend this pizzelle iron	20
0	while cute this little pan is difficult to use there 's no room to use a spatula so you 'd better like the eggs cooked through you ca n't flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it 's so small that it wo n't fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers	20
1	we have had one of these grinders for over 15 years it was always the best and easiest to use simple to change grind size easy to fill and the side turn gives excellent leverage when grinding we broke the top and kept it in place with duct tape not real pretty we were so happy to find the same grinder and now have two	20

0	the wire broke off as i was slicing my first slice of chedder cheese needless to say i do not recommend this cheese slicer last i checked they 're supposed to last longer than one slice maybe mine was faulty but regardless i expect better	20
1	these are so adorable ! the patterns are too cute and they can be mixed and matched just like boring cups and saucers they even make me happy when i see them in the cabinet they are a great shape and size ! i am inspired to upgrade my espresso machine because these only deserve the best !	20
0	i can put up with the weight the noise the poorly located on off switch the spinning brush that is cool but does n't work what i cannot put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on it will appear to be on correctly but if not the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister buy something else i ca n't wait for this one to die	20
0	i bought this sheet set the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son he too loves star wars and as i read the other reviews im nodding my head these sheets feel like burlap ! i have washed them regularly since december with no improvement they dont fade though which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 polyester and only 30 cotton very stiff and scratchy	20
0	i really made a mistake and bought 2 sets thinking i could always have extras ready i tried all types of grinds i packed loosely i packed firmly i packed tight i played and played still did not get a good cup of coffee finally threw them out just taking up space learned a lesson on buying quantity	20
0	i had my first machine for 5 months a gift from a friend when it started to let steam out all over the place i went out and bought another one i thought i was just unlucky with the first one it also only lasted 5 months like the first one i cleaned it vinegar etc like the instructions said no luck steam came from everywhere it would not warm the milk anymore i took it back never again	20
0	this thing basically self destructed the first week the handle pieces would n't stay together and when i pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart not worth the money ! i was very disappointed	20

0	i liked the price and all the different stitches however i needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things such as alterations and heavy sewing i'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine the needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread also the food feed stalls jerks and surges this machine has beautiful stitches but is for lightweight sewing only	20
1	i have found this to be a very good product and easy to use i would give it a 5 star rating if all the removable parts could be washed in a dishwasher i can't see why they could not be	20
0	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped and they were not as light and crispy it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs' which i could n't find in local stores since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one \( incredibly light \) pack	20
1	appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner ! it 's a bit tough on the fingers if you were n't expecting the carafe to be heated basically this is a good coffeemaker just not quite worth the price tag for that amount of money i expected something more	20
1	we love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff we love nothing more than our cast iron and lodge makes great ones at decent prices	20
1	i have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick i was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer the first ones came out and were sticking to the surface i was disheartened thinking i am having the same problem as with the metal i switched to nonstick to avoid this oh well try again and from that moment on was smooth sailing i like the light indicator on this model the easy clean up storage design just everything	20
1	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up i use mine constantly and did n't think i would when i bought it we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own i love my fiestaware you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes	20
0	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
0	i ca n't figure out what is so special about this rice cookerso i am irritated by the price which is making me wonder iftheir whole product line is over priced	20

0	we bought this krups flf2 j4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs it is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water however an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains it had n't diminished during that time it smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee not pleasant we felt it just was n't safe i 've repacked it and will return it if possible krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual	20
0	we bought four sets of the victoria collection 600 thread count queen size the fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed it seems like that were made for a full size not queen size list this as a reject we are very very disappointed	20
0	drip drip drip one drip at a time it takes 20 minutes to fill a pasta pot we 've had it 3 years \( it never worked any faster than this \) and sometimes i'm just tempted to just use the tap water and not worry about lead poisoning from the pipes	20
1	my son and i love this item ! it 's so fun to be able to quickly and easily make shaved ice sometimes we freeze juice or soda in the molds \( rootbeer is a favorite ! \) and sometimes we just use regular ice and sno cone syrup this is one of the best kitchen gadgets i 've ever purchased ! !	20
0	i love water filters this perhaps is my third first was a brita gave to family member years ago and it is still in use went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers then to this ultra this pitcher leaks i suspect it is the style leak is not big time but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items i am not happy elain	20
1	i only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter has n't slept in it yet but i set it up and it was super easy almost one touch set up it is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome it has moons and stars on it the take down was 5 minutes if that it 's small enough to fit almost anywhere and deep enough so that a toddler \( my daughter is 2 \) will not roll off \) love it and i know i will be using it often	20
1	the refill accessory \( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes \) definitely cuts the refill maintenance in half since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected	20
1	i purchased this in cobalt blue it goes with my fiestaware dishes as well as my pzaltsgraf and longerberger pottery i also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful and much nicer in person than online it has a large capacity and pleasing lines i 'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals to be able to use more than one	20
1	this maker pours well and has a soft handle we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online nice little coffee make	20
1	this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it 's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you 'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it 's worth it for such a fine knife	20
1	my cats started drinking a lot more water after i bought this the intention of this product is to mimic flowing water cats love water movement they are attracted to it and want to drink it the more water they drink the healthier they are try it your cats will love it too	20
0	if you read between the lines on the other reviews here i think you 'll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk and their right ! ! ! no matter how small the job it wo n't do it it 's just one more made in china piece of junk that i 've wasted money on it wo n't suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors i do n't get how any company let alone a well known vacuum company could sell such a usless tool my only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars \? \?	20

1	i got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected well made with a sharp edge that holds up the only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip	20

1	this fan is incredibly powerful it can definitely move air around a room my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium i do n't know if it 's just mine that is that way or not and it is n't a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i 'll tell ya when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse	20
1	great product at a great price the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item thank you	20
1	works just fine for my needs i use it to press my 'wrinkle free' dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package 'disappeared' at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups \( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing \) the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	20
0	i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it 's trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	20
0	do n't buy this fan unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed also if it has green lights \( like my blizzard fan did \) it will light up a dark room at night also you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling low speed is quiet enough for sleeping but high will disturb you the angle tilt adjustments are not precise and are difficult to do there are better choices	20
0	amazon is out of red after waiting for 2 months they shipped a white while the packing list states red when contacted they said that they do not have a red for replacement if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for 7 99 not i have to go through the trouble of returning it	20

1	this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart which at best made mediocre toast and had that icky plastic worn out look this toaster is metal sturdy and has a great retro look in today 's colors mine is red i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen amazon service has been great and with the 25 off i got some great buys	20
1	everything about our miele \( red velvet \) vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company 's products	20
0	i have nice sharp blades i sliced veggies and got all these tiny little plastic hairs that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies had to toss them these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough or any other purpose other than for what they are made for chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects for the price it was worth testing them out	20
1	i 've been wanting a knife sharpener for decades but just could n't justify spending over one hundred dollars on one when wa la i discovered the wusthof 2904 model on amazon ! it 's so easy to use and while the scissor sharpener does take some practice it 's wonderful to have useable kitchen shears and regular scissors once again ! sheryl california	20

1	my husband was skeptical why do you need a new 200 pot he said well i bought the dutch oven with two days of receiving it i made the best beef stew he has ever had he said the meat was much more tender than when i make the stew in a crock pot never again will he question me when i say i need a kitchen tool	20
1	i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i do n't like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gonna look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing	20
1	this stock pot is enamel on steel not cast iron it was never meant to be no reason for any confusion i 've had mine for 5 years there are no chips or scratches no matter what i 've made spaghetti sauce posole or any kind of soup nothing has ever burned nor has the enamel come away from the pot turn the heat down i always get perfect results lecreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and does n't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some i 've read above	20

0	one should n't have to empty water out after every use one should n't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware ca n't even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details	20

1	i bought one of these for my apartment and it 's quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it 's a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it 's a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor \( particularly for indoor environments \) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty 's respiratory system	20

0	i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon they shipped the first one damaged then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one ! very frustrating and time wasting think about it its a plastic product that if not shipped packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer	20
0	this steamer performs very poorly the wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space	20

0	omie izzy are brother sister kitties about 6 months old they received this as a gift it 's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we do n't play in it much on our own one of the wires broke already and we 've had it less than one month	20
1	this is a great product for holding your knives my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present i could n't figure out how i could transport the knives along with the blade savers this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives	20
0	i had this vacuum for about a month the suction was so bad that after every room i had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction i hated it ! not only that but the bagless was a pain ! i had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy ! not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever it made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in ! i did not want that in my house ! i absolutely hated this vacuum	20

0	i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i did n't realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	i got a set of 8 a few months ago first one package arrived with a broken one then all of them ended up broken they break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side they break if you set them a little too fast on the table one of them broke by just holding it such poor quality i am extremely disapointed but i loved the design though	20
1	my six month old son would not eat anything off a spoon or out of a bottle finally i tried mixing baby cereal and putting it in this then i mixed cereal and babyfood and or mashed food he loves it ! no gagging either ! i'm here now buying the replacement bags	20
1	this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it 's durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 ! a great deal	20
0	i received this item in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 unable to use still sitting in the box unused tried to contact the 800 given by the rep to return to date no luc	20
1	it was nice to be able to purchase just one mug the delivery was quick	20
0	walnut tradition kitchen scissors \( asin b00005am7r \) do not have comfortable wood handles secured with triple brass rivets they have unattractive chocolate brown plastic handles the bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature and simply get in the way	20
0	what a piece of crap just putting this together broke it and was missing one of the snap parts truely a waste of money	20
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	i bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy i then bought one for my daughter she used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit the blade assembly as per other reviews it is going to cost about 50 to repair now mine is smelling i am using my old 15 year old oster and it is still working also to my surprise it is doing a better job just not as pretty i have ka stand mixer hand blender food processors large and small emersion blender and attachments for all love all of them will buy other ka but not this again	20
0	i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here 's why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the quot stainless quot steel does in fact rust and corrode2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly	20
1	a great ice cream maker no prefreezing bowls it is loud so plan your ice cream making accordingly you will not want to be in the same room as this thing when it is going unless you are already deaf lol ! the price of this remanufactured unit along with the amazon discount running at the time brought it to 125 with no shipping fees try to get that on ebay ! this unit stays on my countertop at all times and attracts much interest from visitors the ice cream is wonderful i recommend ben and jerry 's cookbook and a good ice cream scoop replacement parts can be found on the manufacturer 's website and are reasonably priced	20
0	this is the worst pan i have ever had we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap 1st the silicone smell was horrible 2nd the pan warped in oven i used the sled it came with and followed directions3rd i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue4th the muffins did not come out i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck i will never buy silicone anything do n't waiste your money	20
1	i purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines i have had no issues with the decanture being delicate infact we machine wash it after each use the only issue i have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture	20
0	this red and white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter however it arrived warped so that i really can only use one side \( the board slides around on the counter when i flip it over \)	20
0	i also have this fountian in black i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty the filters do not seem to last very long either i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one i do not reccommend this color at all ! the fountian has been fine until now but it should n't of broke down already	20
0	i am extremely happy with this product it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick it 's a superb design and i am very pleased i would highly recommend it	20
0	i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing	20
1	these glasses are perfect for keeping drinks colder or warmer and the best part is you do n't feel the temperture on the outside nor do you have condensation from the differences between inside and outside tempeture	20
0	i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor \( e g little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose \) also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter maybe it works fine who knows the design and manufacture were so poor i did n't keep it long enough to find out	20
0	gaggia used to be the cat 's meow in espresso they have lost the bubble in the last ten years many other machines do more are easier to use and produce better cups in an easier manner i still have my old gaggia but now rely on a saeko in my home the difference is obvious	20
0	so this clock woke me up alright ! the snooze did n't work and then i could n't turn it off ! i had to rip the batteries out of it to get it to stop it is very cheaply made \( explains the price i guess \) but yeah it works just fine as long as you do n't need to use the snooze ever	20
1	i was very happy with the princess comforter it was plush and soft my granddaughter was thrilled	20
1	we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings \( the friday only sale \) to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold \( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from \) the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions	20
0	this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment ! the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere and if you do not use additional paper filters you get coffee grains in summary a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee the plus \? the water filter but that is it	20
0	well its uz hot to the touch and it has n't really seemed to help my cat with her tension maybe she just does n't have a problem that feliway can help anyway i'm not too thrilled speedy delivery though	20
1	my girlfriend received this kettle last christmas and it 's still working i even use it at times so easy to use fill it up 3 4 of the way with water and push down the red tab thingy nice and hot in 30 45 seconds a minute for larger cup full	20
0	the image in this product is misleading it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior	20
0	beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews	20
1	i bought this exact same slicer 20 years ago for my mom and it has lasted it 's a unique item that guests love and it 's easy to clean up as well	20
1	i have just opened the three sets and they are beautiful they arrived in perfect condition and i cannot believe how fast the delivery was a perfect addition for our dinner table	20

0	the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does n't work disappointing	20
0	2 years ago i purchased these dishes i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star until 6 months ago all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half \( these dishes are microwave safe and no children \) all have broken in the same place 2 broke when picking up 4 have broken while microwavingyet all my cups bowls salad square plates are still in perfect condition but without my dinner plates my set \( s \) are useless ! !	20
0	i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best ! i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake ! do they make them anymore \? ebay help ! !	20
1	i purchased 2 of these perforated pizza pans and they are perfect for baking pizza also i found them great for baking breads and other items as well i would reccomend this product to anyone that bakesthey are easy to clean up and can store very easy	20
1	this is a killer machine it is a little noisey but well worth the small inconvience i have been using this for three weeks and am lovin i	20
1	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable clean up is a breeze i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces	20
1	soft comfortable perfect i came back to buy more i want to throw the rest of my sheets away i was reluctant to buy sheets without being able to touch them first but am so glad i took the chance	20
0	poor workmanship rusted inside of chrome cover \( is it really chrome with rust on it \) very poor construction of the rubber piece and is smells like rubber i really do n't want to smell rubber in my closet	20
1	i was a little hesitant to spend over 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really are n't worth more than a few bucks however i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one the quality of this item is top notch it 's much more sturdy than any others that i 've seen i 've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes the handle is terrific \( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle \) and seems to stay cool while in use this even got raves from my mother	20
1	i use this in my 29 gallon and the filter is excellent the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in it is also very quiet however when the power goes out and comes back on it wo n't begin working again you must add water to it to get it up and running this has been a problem when i 've gone on vacation and i 've come home to cloudy water the refills are also pretty expensive and can get a bit messy it 's all worth it though it keeps my tank in nice condition	20
0	i loved it until it broke after using it for a day now when i turn it on the sound will not turn off if it actually worked correctly i think i would have given it a better rating	20
1	i have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for this is by far one of their favorites they love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often \( keeps them off the furniture and other areas \) i know they play with it daily very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats ! !	20
1	so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i	20
0	as you can see in the picture the pestle \( the part you hold in your hand \) has quite a wide bottom unfortunately this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location making it practically impossible to grind seeds \( e g cumin \) to dust i tried it once on cumin seeds and gave up	20
0	ive had this vacumn for about 2 years after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way still has very good power bad news it doesnt move around easy it is like dragging an old tire around hard to turn and direct canister always rolls over the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt and dont vacumn that often i guess because i dread using it i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while but still like i said lots of power if you keep the filter clean	20
1	we are very pleased with the quality of this couch the leather is soft but durable the craftsmanship is excellent and it is very attractive also the delivery was exceptionally fast we highly recommend this product	20
1	the pillow was in the manuracturer 's box in brand new packing and condition and was delivered right on schedule	20
1	beautiful good quality bowls heavy and thick they wo n't break easily vibrant colors i 'll be buying more	20
1	i am looking for a new book light and as a former owner of this light i was suprised at the bad bulb stats this bulb like halogen bulbs get very hot it is imperative that you do not touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it the oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp and hastens failure hope this help	20
1	just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another \( cheaper \) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect ! as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china i was astounded none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker just perfect plump fragrant rice the countertop stayed clean as well did n't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker clean up of the cooker was easy top notch excellent product you ca n't make better rice than what this thing produces	20
1	i loved my hamilton beach unit and when i got use to the small about of noise that did not bother me dusting was way down and now that my unit has stopped working i notice a big big difference in the dust and my allergies i have no idea why it stopped working after only having it for 3 years but it did anyone else have this problem	20
1	i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish ! looks great on my table \( along with my red salt and papper shakers	20
0	some how my previous review text got a little glitched up but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected it 's the first time i ve been totally disappointed we 're returning the knives because they are not worth the money really they look great in the picutre but they are very poor quality why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars	20
0	first off i paid 25 00 for this at walmart so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for 54 00 secondly it works fine for the amt of money i spent thirdly my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it i will have to put ear plugs in seriously this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm ! ! i have an email in to eureka com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to	20
1	keeps the tank warm for my little fish friend	20
0	i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money	20
1	by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non stick pans it 's already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface	20
0	the add said it would seperate small berry seeds the holes on the smallest grate are about 1 8 you could fit 20 seed through one of them very disappointing	20
1	the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer 's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly	20
0	ordered this at my wife 's request she 's tried cleaning silver earrings run multiple cycles added detergent as suggested it just does n't clean an old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better a very disappointing piece of junk	20
1	i bought this product for our family to start making pizzelles its so easy to make and the size is just perfect i would recommend this product to everyone kids can do this too	20
1	this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i had n't foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it	20
0	this fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room go for the industrial strength expensive ones	20
0	a couple of days ago i depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me thus causing the demise of my applicance i now realize i paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year	20
0	i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product would n't even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you 're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen	20
0	riedel 's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in france of glass \( not crystal \) the stem 's too short for wine in my opinion but you could always use them for water the water glasses are more suitable though as they have a wider mouth	20
0	my beagle \( 13 mo \) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks not smaller barking or any form of whining \( even if extremely loud \)	20
0	it seemed like a great idea at the time but it does not work at all simply the grass is n't growing it only made the water in the fountain dirt	20
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top i was sent new doors but they did n't fit frustrated i accepted the promised 175 00 off to keep the doors knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later i have yet to receive this refund the delivery was also a major problem there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone so i tipped him to bring it in for me i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	the sewing machine is built very cheaply does not even sew correctly i understand i didnot pay that much but to feel you really are just ripping people off its an item i ended up throwing out for it just took up space	20
1	i have been in love with the set for years they are versatile sharp and reliable ! each piece has its own speciality and the whole set satisfies all your need for kitchen endeavor i personally like the vegetable chopper and the curved bone chopper best	20
0	i paid what i would call a fairly high price for a blanket i could have gotten from a discount club for half the price the photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed the left right sides are simply cut i expect this to disolve within 4 washes will not buy from this manufacturer again	20
1	i was looking for an quot offset serrated knife quot as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights	20
0	the humidifier worked great for 2 weeks but now leaks all over the floor during operation i would not recommend buying this product	20
1	gorgeous unique useful ! i bought this as a gift and it is the recepient 's favorite great gift do not hesitate buy now !	20
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it does n't spill any thing	20
0	i bought this machine after researching it for a long time i could deal with the hard cleaning of it i was willing to shell out 100 00 for a good quality maker and i loved the design after two or three uses it started to leak after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly i did n't return it i just will never buy bodum again	20
0	i did not buy the whole set my review is for an 8 fry pan it was one of those try it deals i do not like the grooves in the pan because after for instance frying an egg the grooves retain food and if you do n't use a brush to scrub the grooves you 'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves i ca n't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware yikes	20
1	this product is great to have on hand in the past i 've used purchased yogurt as a starter but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt after a small delivery snafu the company immediately sent me a replacement they also sent me a follow up e mail just to make sure that i received the product \( thanks fred ! ! !	20
0	saucepan made in indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely there was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit it was in the construction of the pan as a long time user of revere ware we were very disappointed in this product sent to us we will never purchase another revere ware product once burned we will not go back to a second treatment	20
1	i absolutely adore these kyocera knives they are the sharpest things i have ever seen i ordered this through witbecks and the first one got lost in the mail that can always happen when i contacted matt witbeck he responded immediately \( that night from home \) and the next day sent me a replacement i have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service and so i want to recommend witbecks to anyone	20
1	this whisk is excellent it is well made and easy to clean i use mine all the time to beat eggs for making omelets etc it is excellent quality that will last a lifetime highly recommended ! a	20
1	this is a very good product it is exactly as it is pictured and described clear insulated unbreakable and does not leave a ring on your table the company is very quick shipping along with great follow up and follow through a fine product and i will be ordering more	20
0	i loved this vacuum initially you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint you ahve to empty the filter every 5 10 minutes i do not have a terribly messy household just one with no stairs going to the front backyard	20
1	it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed	20
0	alas this had no discernable effect on my cats however the product arrived in good time and in good shape	20
0	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet item is being returned	20
0	the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down	20
1	i just recieved this a few days ago and it really works great i purchased this for using with my non stick cookware and it works like a dream i made alfredo sauce and it thoroughly mixed everything with no problems and the cheese did n't stick at all great item as well as product line	20
1	i like this style of salad spinner when i ordered it though i did n't realize that it is as small as it is it would be adequate for one person who does n't chow down on salad all day i recomend the product if you do n't have much salad to spin	20
1	i really enjoy cooking in this pot it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes the enamel surface is wonderful i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family the only drawback is how heavy the pot is but that does n't change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen !	20
1	item shipped lightening fast ! in perfect condition ! just as describe	20
1	ove glove is great everything they say it is my husband is the chef it was my valentine 's day gift to him and he 's happy as a clam ! thanks ove glove	20
1	i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it 's a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i did n't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it 's also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila ! a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money	20
0	i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser when it arrived the teapot was broken with a large section missing from the side i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price after receiving my second teapot it was cracked in the exact same spot i returned the product and complained with no response i was refunded the price for the teapot but i am out 10 in the cost of shipping it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot so i would try a different product	20
1	a very nice blender it crushes and purees just about anything i 've had it for three years now and it is still in great condition and still very powerful very loud ! you might need ear protection as you use this i often turn it on leave the room do something else and come back in when i think it is done ! i'm not kidding !	20
0	i would not recommend purchasing these sheets they are thin not very soft and they wrinkle easily	20
0	i only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on \( not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on \) caused the inner lid seal to break the lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced now i have to deal with seeing if amazon will help me replace the unit even though i already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago i would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein	20
0	this product did not come with all that was advertised	20
0	although i have used this model before and have all good results the one i bought for christmas did not work jura capresso states that they test their machines before they leave the factory they might have tested mine and it may have worked but all it did for me was spit out hot water underneath the tray i tried different grind settings but to no avail water flowing out the bottom of the machine too bad as this was a gift for all of my family imagine the look on their faces when all they got was water dripping onto the floor	20
1	after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic natural than using a loaf pan the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old fashioned way when it 's done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre heated bread stone in the oven the loaves look and taste great	20
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided much smaller than anticipated i can only fit a tablespoon in it	20
0	the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i'm almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though	20
1	wow this speaker is fantastic ! ! ! it took a little time to get it setup but once we figured it out it worked like one of our top quality indoor speakers ! ! ! when i read the reviews i was hopeful but not sure now we love it and would recommend it to anyone ! we can use it in the font yard down by the swings and even in the basement \( which we did for our son 's pirate brithdday bash \) please do n't pass this up ! if you are in the market for an outdoor speaker this is great ! it may take a little time to set up but worth it enjoy ! !	20
0	had this grinder for 8 months two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds i'm tossing it and getting a different brand all form no function	20
1	i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there 's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i 've had good success with the waring	20
1	i have a beagle basset hound mix who as you can guess used to bark all the time after only using product for a coupld of says there is a vast improvement he does not even have to wear it all the time now there is a lot more peace and quite at my house since i purchased this product it saved my sanity	20
0	this product does work and produces great tasting water for a while i thought maybe we 'd done something to make it leak but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time \( approx 8 months \) there 's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks and then eventually squirts water all over the place there is no way to fix it we wo n't be buying this brand again	20
1	what a great masterpiece ! this beautiful salt and pepper shaker set is an attractive useful set great to use for bright rooms ! cheery color even the pepper will brighten your day	20
1	i was lucky to get the stainless popper on clearance it is wonderful we have used it for several months now it is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn i am so disappointed that target is not carrying the stainless model anymore my college children who do n't live at home want their own even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan i'm sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models when i bought mine i chose stainless because i knew it could handle the high heat well and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher hey target how about carrying the stainless model again \?	20
0	it looked okay when i opened it then i washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of cranberry colored lint \( wet in the washer and dry in the dryer \) the next time i washed it was better but still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer it is not warm enough alone it might be okay in the warmer months but not what i expected for winter	20
0	i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous which it may be but on the first pizza i cut \( on the mountain woods peel \) the edge is now folded over a bit rendering the edge much much less sharp than out of the box so i would suggest you save your 3 and the out sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while	20
0	i bought it some time ago for much less also from amazon it is not worth 24 00 may be 6 9	20
0	i also had the surprise and joy of having my carafe 's glass lining explode the carafe had a little over 1 5 years of use and i never used any sort of abrasive on it note that for the price of this replacement carafe you could pay for most of a whole new coffee machine	20
1	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it 's also compact i gained a little more counter space	20
1	love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh this one holds a larger amount than others i have had it is a bit more awkward to hold however it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up love the emile henry colors	20
1	this is the best book light ever my only issue is the battery life but i fall asleep and leave it on all night sometimes the pages are illuminated very well and it 's easy to use makes a great book mark too do n't let what i said about the batteries influence you not to buy i have both sizes i'm rough on them and i 've had no problems	20
1	still allows some dust deposits live in az and do n't have water softener need to change more often than recommended	20
0	after about 10 days from date of purchase only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle i would have to push the on button get another 2 cups after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through the design is bad for left handed people it 's very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid overall not a good design i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker	20
1	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i'm really glad to add this to my pantry	20
0	received this as a gift and i must say i'm very disappointed at its highest setting it takes forever to toast the other issue is that if you buy any bread with non standard width \( like home made gourmet breads \) it wo n't fit into the toaster	20
0	the design is great the function is not always difficult to get both in the same package ! i'm going to return it it toasts unevenly toast is not crisp it burns a corner of the toast	20
0	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	20
1	this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container	20
0	this is a lemon lime press the oranges in china must be real small so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit	20
0	one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector 's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a 10 tie for his birthday	21
1	the pump works well certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price ! it does however leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot the instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty and it is best discarded in reality the design of the pump just does n't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level i was however able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large mouth jar when poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it leaving only a small amount that i did n't mind discarding	21
0	you have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is \? this product is proof of that i really wanted to avoid poison and traps so i thought i would try this p o s to solve my gopher problem humanely sure i was skeptical but some buyers reported success after 4 weeks i can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product i noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity but i have seen nothing nada zip numerous fat happy gophers before numerous fat happy gophers after caveat emptor	21
0	the bars were represented to be 25 inches long in fact they measured 22 amp 9 16 inches long the required length is 23 amp 7 16 inches in either case they wo n't fit i am in process or returning	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
0	this unit will be lucky to be within 15 deg of actual out side temp after several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different sending unit which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit i would not recommend this unit to anyone	21
1	i have two of these one in my bedroom and one outside they work great i also have one simular to this one except it has a 4 ft external temp sensing wire that can be used for a pool or freezer i use mine in a freezer in my shed 150 ft away all three send a signal back to a small base unit in my living room that i monitor daily i lost power to my shed last week if not for the temp sensor in the freezer reading 20 degrees i probably would have had a lot of food spoil if these sensors ever go bad i will get new units	21
0	i purchased this in january and finally got a chance to use it for easter it never registered a reading from the meat i was cooking now i'm stuck with an expensive timer if you 're thinking of purchasing this wireless thermometer think twice	21
1	cover fit easily over grill no problems plus it was cheaper than name brand	21
1	this is a good rack it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together \( i cook mainly full spare ribs \) i have rib racks from steven raichlen that are perfect the more spacious racks allow for better basting heat distribution and more even cooking when the meat touches like in the weber rack the meat does n't cook as well	21
1	this is a great little table ! i'm able to stand at the table and cut fabric for a sewing project then adjust the height and the kids can sit at the table and paint or craft i am very pleased with this purchase !	21
1	for the price you get the same as other units selling for double or triple the price the most important feature for me was exterior temp and humidity plus the unobtrusive design of the unit all functions are easy to read on the display could not be happier with this purchase !	21
1	love it ! ! ! projection of time in soft red light in numbers that are easily read without glasses extremely non invasive light especially enjoy feature of two separate alarms very accurate temperature readings of both indoor and outside temperatures well worth the money ! ! !	21
0	be carful where you place it must be put in a shady place or it reads crazy ! hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously ca n't be seen at night	21
0	when my house painter could n't figure out how to use the nozzle he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts i looked everywhere on line for a replacement part but could not find anything finally i called hozelock in new york and they sent me a replacement part they charged me about 6 for shipping a part that cost about 3 the system ca n't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler also it is hard to reel the hose in overall i do n't think this item is worth the cost if you need to call hozelock their number is 1 800 297 7461	21
1	i did a lot of research and if you follow directions it is safe and fun it takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb turkey the pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird the turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering watch the oil temp so it does not go over 350 do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells	21
1	i just received this table and i can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking the table is adjustable in height so no matter where i am scrapbooking i can adjust the height to fit the chair i am sitting in the table is light enough for me to move by myself and will fold up for easy storage the table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters i'm thinking of purchasing another so i can spread out even more !	21
1	heavy guage vinyl grill cover made specifically to fit char broil 65 inch grills covers completely good quality nothing bad to say about the product glad i purchased it to protect my grill in winter	21
1	i ordered this clock for my dad and he loves it it is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically the indoor temp is a nice addition and the price is right	21
1	we were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it but we are really glad we decided to buy it ! so far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around ! and believe me we live in a mountainy area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage i have not seen them ever since we bought this product it is working for us	21
1	this is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings plus all the attachments make cleaning very versatile i looked at a similar system listed in the frontgate catalog and almost purchased it for more than 120 00 then i found this for less than 40 00 it 's great and i recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb dust free	21
0	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
1	we had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds we ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly w o special instructions to do so when we received it it was a bit thinner than i wanted but for the price and fast delivery it was great ! ! ! the material is durable and of good quality our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it 's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear like i said it 's a bit thinner than i wanted but a good buy	21
1	accurate and easy to use just push the button amd insert better for grilling than oven work a bit bigger than i would like but not too long maybe a foot and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil very accurate and sturdy the on and off label has come unglued on mine so i need to reglue it	21
0	ordered the stainless flavorizer bars for a genisis 1000 which is supposed to be 13 bars what i received were 5 porcelain bars for a completely different model	21
1	very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my weber spirit 500 grill took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button no more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy cold day	21
1	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21
1	set up easily stores easily transports easily for grilled meals for two skewered food sausages steaks burgers fish corn on the cob it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big bbq the folding legs keep the direct heat off any surface underneath with this efficient little griller we 're enjoying patio cook outs much more frequently than before	21
1	when i ordered this mitt i did not know any thing about this brand or if i would even like it i found it to be absolutely perfect for my needs it is thick enough that you will not burn your hands but soft enough that the leather will not scrape your hand with prolong use it was just what i wanted	21
1	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	21
0	the turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off the stake is round and too short it wo n't stay in ground pretty much useless	21
1	this is by far the best grill accessory i have every gotten it cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender i have n't tried cooking anything else but i'm sure whatever it was it would come out great i would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill	21
0	i received the lacrosse weather station as a gift it started out working ok for about 4 weeks plagued by software and communication problems i do not recomend it to anyone the tecnical support team is of little or no help it all goes back to that old saying you get what you pay for a very dissatisified customer	21
1	bought this for my wife she loves it perfect for a first time bounty hunters it works very well for anyone that does n't need all the professional features	21
0	i normally bbq 8 9 racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you 're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that 's not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law	21
0	this product is a waste of money the mice in my room are completely unaffected and walk right by the device without any sign of concern besides being ineffective the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound \( not silent as advertised \) i now have to buy a set of \( humane \) mousetraps and i recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves 40	21
1	we 've used artificial christmas trees for years and every year we 've taken off the ornament etc and broken the tree down for storage this year we ordered the christmas tree bag this year we took off the stand and set the entire tree ornaments and all in the bag only about a foot of the trunk stuck out after zipping up where has this bag been all these years \? next year we 'll unzip put on the stand and set up the tree plug in the lights and away we go	21
1	it is a very nice looking clock i received it in the early afternoon i placed it on the wall in my home office it repeatedly failed to adjust itself over the next three hours i removed it and placed it facing outward against the pane of a north facing window it adjusted to the correct time within 15 minutes i rehung it in the home office and it has been keeping good time every since i am very happy with the value that i received for my money	21
1	works great cooking space on grill holds a large amount of meat fish etc we would like to see a canister that holds more gas than for cooking only five meals	21
1	this platter is suitable for serving a main entree as it is bigger than the average plate metal insert comes out easily for cleaning have owned it for over a year and it has been durable no complaints	21
0	i tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some i didnot see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes actually thereseemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed i did try different locations perhaps they are attracted to it but they are not being sucked in looking at the tray it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects	21
1	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
1	well made comfortable and attractive folds and opens easily only tall \( 6' \) or wide people need this size i'm 5'10 and the standard size fits me better	21
1	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21
1	good price for a good working clock clock sets itself in about 24 hours not bad would have been nice if had acutal barometric pressures instead of the picture of the sun or clouds and trending arrow	21
1	this is an easy device to set up it works great ! i am very pleased with this produc	21
0	the editorial review states its big enough for two heads to rest on it it would be more informative if you stated the dimensions of the pillow !	21
1	i am extremely happy with this perfect accent lights for my front planter i will definitely buy another set for the side planter price was right but shipping costs a little too high well packaged on delivery	21
1	weber discontinued it and amazon no longer has it my pal has a condo with a balcony \( not large \) this is the weber for her equip it with one charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking usually the 14 inch smokey joe 's are too small often my 22 inch performer is too big but this jumbo joe is just right weber bring it back ! !	21
1	these birdie hose reels are such a nice addition to my yard i bought two packs and have lined my front garden with them they are a very nice heavy weight and the overall detail is much more then i expected especially for this price i agree the stakes could have been an inch longer however i am having no issues with the size of my hose fitting into the track i am not sure what size hose the other customer is using it must be a professional grade hose ready for spring !	21
0	i have two units and two sensors i thought they would all be compatible i just received this sensor yesterday and find it works alone but is n't compatible with my units i wish i had checked this out more carefully before i purchased it	21
1	after much research and reading lots of reviews we chose this weber it is more expensive than others in its category but the high reviews and our past experience with weber and the warranty helped us make this our choice we love it so far we live on top of a hill and one of our concerns was the wind well the grill performs superbly ! even on a cold \( 40 degrees \) and windy day it heated up in less than 10 mintues	21
0	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
0	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
0	the major problem with this device is its placement location in proximity to the indoors e g on a window the indoor temp seems to affect the outdoor temp reading by anywhere from 3 to 7 degrees would be better if it had a wire probe that extended further from the device returned item do n't waste your money	21
1	these are a big improvement over the porcelin ones the food seemed to cook faster and tasted better they were heavier than i thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my silver b	21
0	i have have had this item for 6 months and tried to change the time since it did not update itself for daylight savings i waited about 15 minutes to reinstall the batteries when i did there was no time display i waited for possible transmission overnight and positioned it to the north and the south sky still no time i changed the batteries several times no results i will never buy this brand again	21
1	here 's what i like about them 1 they 're metal i ca n't tell you how many times i 've broken those cheap plastic ones when i was trying to put them into the ground2 led lights they have a nice white glow to them instead of the crappy yellowish glow that normal bulbs put off3 the packaging everything they use for packaging is recyclable \( cardboard plastic bags that are clearly marked with the recycle logo info	21
1	i bought this for my husband in december we put it in december 25 \( we have an acre for our back yard \) with about 40 mole holes the ground has been freezing on and off and we put one in the middle of an old hole takes 3 d batteries and believe it or not the thing is still vibrating \( sounds kind of irritating if your close \) but who cares beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery no new holes you could chew more juicy fruit which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard but that only lasts you about 3 weeks i m buying another for the front yard	21
1	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	i 've had one of these for years and bought them for gifts several times they work great	21
1	received this item and its great ! ! i have this under a gazebo and wanted an asian modern look with straight lines this was perfect the type of wicker \( actually plastic \) is very durable the cushions are thick and actually solid some are real soft \( cheap \) these are not this chair is really wide and sits low to the ground i could not have asked for better i bought the whole set and everything is great email me with any questions chris schaffner gmail com orange county c	21
0	a handle was missing the box was retaped may be a return from a store etc overall the item is chintzy you have to assemble it the charcoal pan is painted black this will burn off slowly i am going to assemble it but this item when shipping is included is a total ripoff john	21
1	i bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area it creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports the cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles the sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm	21
1	while we 've used coleman folding stoves for years if you have trunk space there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill the small tank makes this practical for camping if you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available this is a great choice for camping equipment we still like the coleman for boiling water but i love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	21
0	this item is such a huge hunk of junk ! first off the instructions are totally impossible to figure out and second off the outside temp is always off by at least 12 degrees	21
0	i purchased 8 of the aa batteries because of the low price of 4 99 for 4 the fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps after many days of refreshing the battery in my la crosse bc 900 charger i ended up with the following 1634 milli amps1795170120011769178117541549so two of the cells are below spec earlier i had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from sanyo on amazon for about 12 99 per four all of them were within spec i'm glad i did n't pay a penny more than 4 99 for four	21
1	i have an oval table that seats six the chairs are both stationary and swivel style this fits the set perfectly nice durable canvas fabric handles to pull to the sides straps to anchor cover to furniture set only negative is it has pull straps to tighten the cover along the bottom however the canvas does not move well enough to really pull it taut great value though	21
0	it does not like rapid changes in temperature when the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back all of that is moot because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors though it is a mere 45 degrees outside sent it back	21
1	this grill is a great alternative to the expensive larger q grills perfect for an entry level weber for an apartment etc the only thing i can think of that i dont care for is the handle gets very hot so be careful	21
1	i'm new to the world of smoking and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing it works fairly well and the flavor is great but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill i 've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way a worthwhile purchase	21
1	you ca n't really beat this for 12 ! it 's fairly attractive and seems pretty well made it seems as though it will do a pretty good job at removing dirt etc from shoes as the bristles on it are very tough and the crevaces are alot bigger than you can see in the picture this would cost at least 10 more in the stores thinking about buying one for my other 2 entry doors	21

1	one of the most comfy chairs i own just delightful to sit outside on the patio i love my chair in fact i 've got two i ca n't say anything more then these are beautiful relaxing comfy chairs	21
1	just got to use the weber baby q griddle it worked great the only complaint i have is that it could be bigger it covers just a little over half of the available grill area more would be better other than that the design is excellent and it works great	21
1	i have been using a grill mat for 4 months and i love it i grill fish and chicken on a broilmaster grill and i have only great things to say about the mat i spray a bit of olive oil on after it is warm and then grill my food and it is great ! !	21

1	this is our second weber grill in the past 10 years in fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s same size and features we actually use natural gas rather than propane \( i goofed on the order \) but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one we 've used it a few times and it works perfectly quickly heats up and grills evenly looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill	21
1	my only reservation is that i had no choice on the specific type of basil plants i receive some of the ones in the kit are not ones i am interested in	21
0	i am surprised that amazon permits the sale of this equipment many scientific evaluations have shown that the sound generators have no effects what so ever against rodents or for that matter against mosquitoes	21
1	i bought one for my girlfriend over a few years ago it sets itself and projects the time on the ceiling in a soft red this is an amazing feature no more getting up or turning your head to check the time it makes the sleep experience much more comfortable	21
1	first off the picture is all wrong the tools are just like the ones in the mr bar b q 5 piece oval stainless handle tool set except you also get the plastic case scraper 8 corn holders and 4 knives not the wooden ones shown in the picture it comes with the xxxl spatula and tongs i mean these thing are huge in every sense of the word its a nice set for the price i would have like a smaller spatula and tongs like the ones shown they are almost too big but i am sure this will last a long time the tools look quite durable good buy but just be aware what you are actually buying	21
0	i ordered two of these sets and was not sent what is described there is no large aluminum basket and no fish fry basket included the description says it is professional grade but i received commercial grade customer service has offered to send me out a replacement but i am assuming the same thing will happen again it seems as if amazon attached the wrong picture and description to this item beware if you want everything that is listed that's not what you will get	21
1	easy to assemble lightweight but solid enough for outside comfortable to sit in and eat on the table top is a bit springy but all in all perfect for tight spaces	21

1	for the money 10 99 i wish i had bought another set now that i see the price has risen these are heavy and they stay in the ground where put i have had no problem whatsoever with them coming up due to pressure from the hose my hose is very long ultra heavy and thick and the guides keep the hose from going into my plants at the corners they are also very good looking and are a complement to the yard now that the price lowered to 9 99 i bought three more in december 2006 the new ones have the same quality as the earlier one	21
1	i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	21
0	these devices tested by the fda decades ago \( including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches \) do not work there have been a number of class action lawsuits against the companies that sell these they simply do n't and ca n't work against insects or rodents it 's science	21
1	i bought 2 of these chairs back in june 06 they are great ! they are built well and look wonderful very comfortable and roomy i have them in an area that gets diffused light but they got rained on alot with winter upon us i now have them stored outside under a protective cover i would definately buy more of this line local stores want 300 400 for a chair of this quality great buy	21

1	everything about this collection is first class the pictures on the site were accurate i was glad i made the purchase it saved me hundreds of dollars compared to the retail mark up from my other distributor of patio furniture i ended up purchasing the whole collection	21
1	what is great about the salad greens seed kit is the aerogarden the instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up watching the greens leaf out waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat and healthy ! we are now watching baby herbs sprout !	21
1	the clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on all i had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of colorado and i experienced no problems with it then or now i would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate	21
0	what a joke not worth the money i put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through swapped batteries pulled it out washed it and looked at all the parts it was either used and resold to me by amazon or it was defective from the start and since they have a 30 day return policy i am now stuck with it i will see what eastman says next very disappointing i will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it	21
0	beware amazon lists this cover with the weber performer grill it does not fit the 2006 performer and should not be purchased together	21

1	this is the only feeder that attracts hummingbirds to our door we had birds eating right at the glass slider on the front deck all summer long ! the birds loved it and my family did too	21
1	this cooking utensil is unlike any other its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well say for example that your meat is not turning out well at all infact it does n't seem to look like meat anymore just crap well with this fork you can whack the meat stab it and then hurl it across the yard and trust me you 'll feel much better	21
0	i spent 3 hours putting this thing together all the parts were there and it all fit together okay after i finished i noticed that it seemed small for my deck i bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8 square well it actually measures 9'8 square so now i have to take it down box it up and start again	21
0	very disappointed purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the spring and summer time well i think these units invite the ants in we 've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room etc these devices do not phase them at all they continue to parade right by	21

1	while the 04' model of the performer is slightly pricier than the latest 05' model there is no comparision between the two models in terms of design function and useability if you want the best charcoal grill made your choice should be an 04' performer ! ! !	21
1	my wife and kids love the chair but i do n't care for it that much i thought the chair was a little bit constricting assembly was easy give yourself alot of room for it the base is huge	21
0	the material and construction are good i purchased this because the ad said it would fit a 9' tree the bag is 6' long	21
1	these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella very low tech and smart my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for they are totally stationary and do n't have a tilting feature that might be standard i just do n't know but i would have wanted that flexibility oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible and they 're simple to put together and take apart great price and they block the sun and look terrific	21
1	i never know what to get my mother in law for her birthday my husband mentioned that she had a lot of hummmingbirds around her house so i got her this feeder she told me that all the hummingbirds now go to this feeder and not the others she was very pleased with it which made me very happy she 's a great mother in law	21

1	just received this and think it will turn out to be a great table bought the bench and matching chairs they are a great set	21
1	i got this grill last year as a father 's day gift i 'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill man for a looong time this smoker makes it easy i 've done ribs brisquet pork steaks chicken all turned out great that brisquet especially ! make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it there are instructions in the box also if your model does n't come with the built in thermometer make sure you order one from the char broil website using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat	21
0	i had this watch for a few months and feature wise it meets all my expectations but i snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off no big deal i thought i 'll just snap it back in that 's when i noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the plastic casing and was thus unrepairable over the few months i have had it it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing great features poor build quality not recommended	21
1	this wonderful hammock continues to offer my family a much needed break from gardening raking or playing with the kids the kids love to pile in and spin until they are dizzy while i enjoy a much needed break and read a favorite book	21
1	this is a quality heavy duty grill cover when you pay good money for a weber grill you want it to stay looking good do n't go buy one of those cheap walmart covers for 10 it will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two this cover wasnt cheap but by the looks of it it should last a long time	21
1	wood chips and this rotisserie you are missing one of the great pleasures in life well made and built to last years	21
1	this card table is very sturdy the legs are solidly locked in place both when extended and when stored the top appears to be durable overall this appears to be a quality product	21
1	i ordered two orders which equals four chairs the boxes are thick and double boxed the chairs are placed one inside the other all wrapped with paper around the legs arms and on top of the back fairly light weight and solid frame nothing to put together the color is a low luster pretty taupe color with tiny specks of silver very expensive looking the cushions are a golden taupe color with an expensive weave pattern and piping around the edges top and bottom for structure it feels durable and water proof the back corners have velcro straps to hold the cushions in place they can be neatly stacked i'm extremely pleased with this order thank you amazon	21
1	this umbrella 's quality belies its bargain price it assembled easily and opens closes smoothly the construction seems sturdy and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate my only complaint and it 's almost trivial is the resin finial faded rather quickly in the sunlight i'm overall quite pleased with the product and i'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these	21
1	these herbs are too young to taste yet but they are coming along ! i previously grew the salad greens which thrived but were n't as handy as having fresh herbs growing especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store i am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis	21
1	these are very nice quality and comfortable everything was as expected and came in just a few days	21
1	nice build quailty works well in sub zero temps surprised two fold easy assembly and made in china !	21

1	i just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand the grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel i got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle i got i tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula i felt like a short order cook !	21
1	there are probably more authentic ways to make real bbq but nothing any easier if what you like about bbq is the flavor not the work this unit is for you add water to the pan chips to holder put some dry rubbed pork on one \( or all \) of the four grates light the gas and you are good to go it holds temperature very well unattended adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want your friends will think you are a genius	21
1	nice fabric and construction backordered item came 3 weeks before expected fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website but that ca n't always be helped	21
1	i 've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts a turkey and a pork roast were quite good ! i anticipate excellent results as i gain experience one caveat it does n't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10 15 lb roasts the instruction booklet does n't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes but there 's lots of both on the internet i suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w a gas grill but i 've been using charcoal for many many years and that 's that	21
1	well i like the cover but i it is hard to put on i hoped that it would slip over the grill easily it does not it is a tight fit the quality of the cover is excellent i just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier	21
1	just from looking at the picture i can tell that this chair is made from redwood and is constructed with quot mortice and tennon quot joints a very solid method of construction my only hesitation is that there are no measurements given plus if the chair and chair back slats are n't thick enough they will be prone to spliting	21
1	i do n't own one yet but i am buying one this week ! although i am a diehard amazon customer i am not buying it here cause lowes regular price is half what it is here my friend has owned his for a couple of years loves it i have had some food from it it was so moist flavorful i 'd recommend it but i would probably check around to see if it 's cheaper in your area	21
1	the firepit was exactly as described and of good quality arrived faster than promised a quality item to get and enjoy an evening with the family roasting marshmellows	21
0	like other reviewers initially i was impressed with these very stylish and comfortable chairs however after 1 year outside \( in colorado \) the rubber on the arms was all cracked and peeling and the cords were frayed the overall appearance was of a much older chair of course it happened to be my mother in law who sat in one of the chairs when it gave way a second chair 's cord gave way shortly afterwards	21
0	i purchased this for my husband and it quit working after 3 months	21
1	i wanted this since i did n't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier has large and convienent display due to its size and battery power i can easily move it around the house to check temp humidity in different rooms	21
1	cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do i i purchased two as gifts one for my husband and one for my son in law for fathers day both are extreamly pleased with the product	21
1	i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews it did the job i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual	21
1	in using this product i actually did find a mouse later in the kitchen caught by a trap this product should be used in coordination with other devices to kill rodents and not depend on it alone	21
0	the cover that i received was much shorter than pictured someone else had the same problem i sent it back it seemed pointless i am using my old weber cover it does n't look real pretty but it provides outdoor protection which is the point	21
0	i loved this smoker the first two times i used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it did n't work at all after examining all the parts i noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points it was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but i was forced to pay the shipping ! i used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use i think i 'll go back to my charcoal grill	21
1	bought a nice grill wanted needed a cover works well a bit ackward but does the job	21
1	i purchased this for my deck i needed a place to store the seat cushions and bench cushion when not in use this bench is awesome it is waterproof and has a good amount of storage space easily assembled with out any tools great extra seating for outdoor parties	21
1	i purchased this smoker last summer the assembly was simple one piece of hardware was missing but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place i replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat i desire it is sensitive to wind though	21
1	the product work perfectly and the displays are very good beaufiful and modern design	21
1	i use this along with the 807 bbq fork for the bbq and the smoker i use the bbq fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting the lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light the alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached the silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free	21
1	bought this for my apartment have two remote sensors one in the bedroom and one between a window and the outside screen for outside temps works flawless and gives the same temp outside as it shows up on the weather channel ! humidity reading is great too as its led me to buy a humidifier for the dry months all in all a good product	21
0	worked ok for about a day and a half then it would go off every few minutes for no reason changed batteries several times to no avail changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it moved it from place to place even watched the scene and still sounded the alarm for no reason this is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy ! ! ! avoid ! !	21
1	this griddle is very useful especially if you bring your grill to the camp site the surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job at first i thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating my only criticism is that it is n't a more non stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use the gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills this item really rounds out the baby q 's options	21
1	we bought our performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store it was the best purchase we ever made ! its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition about 15 20 minutes you 're ready to grill for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal its a piece of cake \( we had our reservations too ! \) and you 're going to wish you switched sooner food never tasted so good	21
1	i 've been looking for an atomic clock with functions and design i finally found it with the 8249 the large display is very nice all info are logically located on the display one quick glance and i know the time indoor outdoor temp humidity day date and month the clock update itself about 2 to 3 times a day i ca n't really ask for more than this especially the price on amazon was really good	21
0	i agree with the other reviewer buy flowtron instead my flowtron 40c lasted 20 years with the same bulb and never had a clogging problem with bugs for the same price the flowtron 40d is a much better buy	21
1	nice cushions that dry out pretty fast seem durable they also seem high quality the only thing is they are more of a tan color the picture shows them as white which is what i really wanted but they are nice could use a strap at the top also so the wind does n't constantly blow them over	21
0	this hummingbird feeder looked like a good idea until i filled it \( following the direction \) and put it up on the window and it fell off 15 seconds later and the glass busted	21
1	i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars	21
1	the companion group works to create new and innovative barbecue accessories that exceed expectations being the first to produce the compartmentalized grill basket means we have a learning curve to balance out before attaining perfection we have identified improvements including a simple insertion mechanism for the detachable handle and have stream lined the compartment lids for easy opening and shutting these adjustments have made for superior functionality making this a product we are proud to call part of the steven raichlen line we sincerely apologize and would encourage anyone who received the unsatisfactory product to call our customer service manager \( 800 521 0505 ext 3512 \) and we will replace the item at no additional charge	21
1	i use this for tailgating primarily it is great because it 's cooking size much bigger than it 's counterparts it holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do it 's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe but does a nicer job because of it 's size i use it often and will continue to do so too bad it is being discontinued	21
1	picked up the time signal within five minutes set your time zone and you 're in business no more guessing if you have the correct time no more resetting twice a year for dst large display characters are easy to read neutral design fits with most any decor i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed a full black circle is actually a full moon	21
0	i was hoping it would repel roaches a common problem in nyc but this thing absolutely does nothing ! ! in the two weeks i used it three bugs wondered into my place in the vicinity of this pest repeller besides you can hear the ticking noise of this device very well like a clock	21
0	i purchased one and it lasted about 3 months light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it stinger replaced it under warranty this time it lasted one month same problem stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1 2 months again same problem will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again will buy a flowtron which i had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2 3 years	21
1	like all weber products i have owned this brush does an excellent job	21
1	we gave this set to my dad for christmas and he was very impressed it has plenty of sturdy all aluminum tools and the case is awesome too	21
0	would not buy this product even on sunny days the lights will only last a few hours in the evening and are not very bright i bought portfolio brand lights which are much better	21
0	i spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest bbq expert these were one of the worst do not buy them the locking mechanism is clunky they do not open and close smoothly the oxo 16 inch tongs are much better and lighter you do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up good luck i had to send these back	21
1	great value look fantastic on the chairs excellent price could n't be happier	21
0	i have one other weather station from la crosse that seems to work ok but this thing is a paperweight as far as i am concerned it shows that it is raining out when the sun is out ! it constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off i have attempted to contact la crosse but as other reviewers have said that is a lost cause they never answer any emails regarding product help or issues and no one seems to answer their phone either maybe i have a lemon but i feel for what they charge for their products la crosse should be more responsive to their customers	21
1	this rack works so much better than trying to balance the chicken on the grill using just the can and the legs now someone has to figure out how to get the chicken off the can after it is cooked	21
1	highly recommed this grill cover the appearance style is classy with it 's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio and it is sooo durable ! i'm sure it will last for years no more ugly black vinyl covers that you punch holes in the first time you try to drape them over the grill i 'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now ! !	21
1	we bought two of these for a large party and have used them 3x times since they are easy to clean and are great for frying and seafood boils ! !	21
1	i paid 200 and free shipping for two chairsthey look like they are worth at least twice that amountglad i ordered them	21
0	as the title says the remote sensor died a quick death so i got a replacement unit the remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well i know that sometimes things go wrong with good products but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke this is a cheaply made piece of equipment so i guess you get what you pay for i gave a friend an oregon scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong so i 'd advise you to stay away from la crosse and go with oregon scientific	21
1	the new burner 's work great good as new ! only problem was removing old burners the screws that hold the ends in place were rusted in place i had to drill them out and replace the screws but all fine now much cheaper than buying new grill	21
1	this is an excellent value for the price the assembly was easy and the storage room exceeds expectations	21
1	after reading these other reviews i decided to wait a while to post a review i bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great relatively easy to put together and really sturdy they are still looking good with no issues with fading or anything my wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all i hope she does n't read this	21
1	this item arrived 1 week early i took it out the box and it was already assembled it is so sleek and extremely comfortable it is a great addition to my patio the price was reasonable and it had free shipping you ca n't beat it ! ! i want another one	21
1	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	i got my grill to go advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far the makers of the grill 2 go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill the open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models it is still easy to transport and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my tarheels play basketball a lot of fun i completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non stick cooking surface for the cooking area	21
1	the best money i 've spent in a long while got a great bargain at amazon com ! food turns out delicous and it is easy to keep clean charcoal grillers unite ! this is an excellent grill for a small family	21
0	i did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows i had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover go to weber in the future to get what you need its worth the extra money	21
1	we have really high ceilings this works great ! and for under 30 you just cant beat it !	21
1	after a few years of use the original rack on my gold c grill was rusty and unusable this is the exact replacement and fits like the original making the grill that much more usuable again	21
1	this little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink it scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean sturdier than any other brush i or my family has used the one we have now has lasted quite a long time it cleans each rail on the grate beautifully the wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean	21
1	to keep it from cracking i am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather	21
0	i purchased a 40 wt stinger insect killer from home depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months since it was near the end of the season i decided to store it and replace the bulb when i put it out in the spring the bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently insects also clogged it after a couple of days i gave up on it and recently purchased a flowtron bk 40 and it works great do n't waste your money buy a flowtron instead \( my last flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb \)	21
1	i hate to admit but we have roaches ! actually we had roaches until last week when i purchased this product i had tried everything sprays bombs traps etc but nothing worked the first day i plugged this little device in there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids would n't go into the kitchen by day 3 the roaches were gone ! i do n't know where they went and i do n't care this device saved my sanity	21
1	clock was a great value and looks good on the wall just keeps ticking always on time thumps up to river city clock	21
0	waste of money the manual does n't have proper instructions and settings buttons also not working as per the manual i do n't know its fault with the manual or button settings i struggled for a week and returned this item	21
1	this thing catches mosquitos ! it 's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane it was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does	21
0	a pretty simple device not really a waterfall concept of any kind the water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc nothing runs down the chain i suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow it 's mostly an asthetic piece	21
1	down here in southern mississippi you can sit inside with the ac in summer or hang a hammock in the shade but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it 's so lightweight i prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it 's so durable i 've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat the grandbaby loves it	21
1	this was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall i was very familiar with this clock since i had the original one for almost 3 years i like the look of this clock and i like the choices you have for different displays overall this is a sweet clock i did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and program this clock it wo n't do what you want it to do not sure if it how the owners manual is written or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features	21
1	i bought this grill locally after researching many others i originally did not want a side burner but have been very happy with it it works great for cooking vegetables in a pan and is superb with the griddle for cooking breakfast i can cook an entire dinner or breakfast without using the stove i do agree that it did take a long time to assemble \( about 2 hrs \) but is solid and works beautifully i would highly recommend this grill for the money it is a great deal	21
0	i bought two of this bite shield there is a small fan to blow out some smell of chemical the mosquito does n't care about the smell i was surrounded by mosquitoes and got bite the same as without this product there is almost no wind it is really disappointed	21
1	the flowtron bug zapper is a great product but bulbs do wear out the cost of the bulbs are not cheap but the destruction of bugs by this unit is very good i use this unit 9 months of the year	21
0	it worked for barely 24 hours on the second day many of the segments that make up the numbers disappeared making it useless	21
0	i bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month one night i saw a mouse running across my stove so i brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop later that evening i was washing dishes and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of shake'n'bake right past the rodent repellant five times ! !	21
1	i'm so excited to use this table the weather has been rainy ever since i got it it assembled beautifully comes w it 's own little tool it 's a nice strong sturdy table but it 's not overly heavy i was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w o any help it 's going to get a lot of use this summer	21
1	i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges \( 2 \) they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive well these are good and i do n't need to replace them the design actually matches my table set and i did n't even realize it until we unpacked them fully assemled ! i only have one complaint and it 's really not that bad the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions are n't cushiony enough other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality	21
0	way to small of a cushion had to purchase another one from a local store	21
1	we own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean \( cobwebs ceiling fans windows etc \) that are out of reach we found this product online and it works great our kids even enjoy using it around the house each attachment is perfect for the task at hand i wish we bought it five years ago	21
1	i purchased 2 of these and could n't be more pleased like another reviewer i gave 4 stars only becuase i 've only had them for a few days and do n't know how they 'll weather they arrive mostly assembled and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set they look great and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon not as huge and heavy as the ones we used to make but they 're solid and much easier to move	21
1	i just rebuilt the genesis i it didnt need the igniter as it lit on the first clickevery time anyway but changed it as it was 7 years old orso also changed the flavorizor bars as they were aboutworn away	21
1	this storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside it was easy to put together and i got it on the friday sale for 69 99 so the price was awesome ! all other benches like this that i researched were over 100 0	21
1	i'm very happy with this product setup was straightforward and the sensor measurements seem to be consistently accurate i think it was a good value i particularly like the outdoor humidity and dew point lcd displays on the body of the outside module in addition to the remote display of the information indoors it is also handy that the remote display shows local time referenced to nist 's wwv	21
1	protects the pit well but is hard to tie tight on a 33 inch pit	21
0	my husband was so excited when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up he is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right only to have issues withthe wind barameter we have tried to trouble shoot with the online andhandwritten manuals unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box sooooo needless to say theexcitement is gone	21
1	it is a great product for the price the prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels it was easy to put together too	21
1	choosing our first grill really was a simple decision we knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while weber was the only way to go in our minds now that we own this grill i can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we do n't use it ! i'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer this grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy and for the two of us this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained highly recommended	21
1	i have owned one for the past 4 years \( have n't turned it off since the day i bought it \) and it 's still projecting strong as ever i bought one for my friend for christmas also and he loves it just as much as i do	21
1	keeps the ribs from searing lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	21
0	i was disappointed with these tongs which was surprising since oxo makes good kitchen utensils i agree with other reviewers it is difficult to grasp and close them unless you have a rather large hand \( which i do n't \) you 're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel ! when comparing these to my 12 tongs my hand grasp was at the same point which really made these 16 tongs no different from the 12 ones	21
0	i ordered this piece and the matching chairs i have waited since july for them to be available they became availabe in september so i ordered them they kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs said they could n't get them so i had to cancel the sofa as well now i am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue ! !	21
1	elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put oxo good grips on the grip map i bought this to complete my good grips bbq set the only thing it lacks that some bbq'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle but that does n't bother me seeing as i do n't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design if the dog does n't get ahold of it it will last a lifetime	21
1	got this on ebay for 150 00 it was barely used give me a high five	21
0	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
0	the clock works well but is really too small and the projection only works well in dimly lit locations it also has to be at some optimal distance from the wall to actually see the numbers it does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it close to a wall	21
1	this was the best price on the internet for this item it fit perfectly and solved the problem	21
1	timely arrival easy to use just the right size for my 10 year old daughter the only suggetion i would offer is to have plain brown packaging this was a christmas gift and arrived on our doorstep the box made it very obvious what was inside	21
1	i have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years the igniter was actually still quite good it is very well made as are most weber products the stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting \( yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat \) it is easy to replace and i end up giving the entire grill a cleaning and tuneup	21
1	it 's a good watch i'm happy with it it does the jobthe altimeter is not that accurate but that 's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters if u do n't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is okthe rest is a o k	21
1	i got my chia herb garden about a month and a half ago and making them grow has been very easy and pleasant they are still tiny but they are doing good my advice is to follow the instructions carefully frequent watering trimming full sun or artificial light as explained in the instructions and plant food not only they can be used in cooking they are very decorative and cute	21
1	if you have a problem seeing the time on your watch at night then this is the answer the time projected on to the ceiling is great also the alarm is unique as it starts slowly and then it starts to accelerate until you turn it off	21
0	i have had this smoker since august and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better	21
0	totally not worth it ! i was shocked to see spiders crawling across the stupid thing more than once ! it does n't work i 've had it for several months and i am still seeing bugs all over the place	21
1	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
1	basic smoker but an outstanding value for the price arrived before expected well packed easy assembly smokes efficiently although the temperature gauge never goes to ideal i'm very pleased with this product	21
1	excellent product my third experienced with oregon scientific products simple to set up and accurat	21
1	really goes good in my room i really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings	21
1	as far as the variety of hummingbird feeders go this is in a category all its own you got your basic plastic molded crappy looking feeders your glass bouble oddly resembling a hanging easter egg type feeders then this lovely mobile which even empty in winter makes a lovely display	21
0	radio reception is bad in the city so i was n't surprised when the clock did n't set itself to set it manually the instructions say to hold down the snooze button for 3 seconds and the time will flash it did n't	21
0	honestly the projection is n't bright enough to see unless you 're in complete darkness i would n't recommend this to anyone	21
1	we bought two of these we were very impressed how easy the set up was since installing the weather station we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures one feature of this weather station is a ice alert up here in north we do get freezing rain ice and snow this station has been right on thebutton with those predictions i would highly recommend the purchase	21
1	put a few racks or ribs and a full chicken in the smoker on the first use and everything came out great with the lp gas it was easy to maintain a pretty steady temperature and the large chip box made great smoke for a long period great barbecue with very little effort	21
1	do n't be fooled by pictures but this set is huge nicely heavy and a bargain for the price	21
1	we stuck this outside our bedroom window now we can see what the temperature is outside as soon as we get up in the morning no more waiting for the weather to come on the news to figure out what to wear !	21
1	the drawback is you ca n't grill at the same time you use the rotisserie but it works wonderfully ! delicious	21
1	we had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds we ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly w o special instructions to do so when we received it it was a bit thinner than i wanted but for the price and fast delivery it was great ! ! ! the material is durable and of good quality our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it 's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear like i said it 's a bit thinner than i wanted but a good buy	21
1	this is my second bug zapper took another brand back that did n't work this zapper is working great and that 's all thanks to its intelligent design some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs this zapper works really well in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we 'd always have bugs coming in the back door now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor great product	21
1	this is a great little barbecue from carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs this little guy does a great job	21
1	my sister gave this to me at christmas and i kept it out on the counter all winter in hopes of an early spring ! ! ! i put all my feeders out the first of may and seen my first hummer the 2nd hope they will find this one on my window they are so neat to sit and watch make your own nectar to use in your feeder i use a funnel works great to fill feeders	21
1	we had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves \( and we know our directionals here \) so if you get it just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up	21
1	i give this 5 stars because the price was right for a name brand it works it is no better or worse than any other grille brushes that i 've used	21
0	i picked up this unit hoping that it would do the job in my backyard all that it has picked up is a few flying insects nothing else unless i am missing something do not waste your money	21
0	my driveway patrol worked okay for a few days then stopped sensing cars as they drove past does anyone know what i can do to get it working again	21
1	i am delighted with this product it is beautiful and reasonably priced	21
1	i love this clock i wanted a small clock for my bedroom and did n't realize it projected when i bought it \( was an impluse purchase when buying a dvd player \) i ca n't live without it now i am nearsighted so this is great in the dark i have given four as gifts \( that 's what i'm buying today \) and i find that when i go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling ! i will always have a projection clock from now on i could n't live without it	21
1	just received one for a housewarming gift have used it twice and am sure it 's a sleeping giant what a great bbq ! ! ! a little messier than a gas grill and takes maybe 20 mins for coals to be white hot start to finish but what gas grill will get the temperature up to 700 deg ! \? \? talk about the ultimate in broiling ! super easy to light push button ignites w propane in 3 5 mins then wait 15 20 mins and go everyone 's going to want one of these ! !	21
1	\( husband writing review \) i use my lodge sportsman as often as possible but sometimes it still has to go into storage for a while this is a rugged cover that is custom fit and i appreciate how much cleaner my grill is when i pull it out keeps the dust and cobwebs to a minimum keeps the rain out if you forget and leave it outside it 's well worth it if you 're going to invest in the grill	21
1	this is a very nice mitt although not as good as another one i have which is a bit heavier still a good buy though	21
0	looks nice when it was standing took several hours to erect doing it by myself had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and i had to throw it all out wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after i received it and heard nothing back so if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy but if not say goodbye	21
1	this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations i 'd shopped around and did n't want to spend 400 plus for a chaise lounge this is a great price plus you get free shipping they arrive completely assembled and well packaged very attractive sturdy and most importantly very comfortable i highly recommend got the side table with ice bucket and love it as well	21
1	i purchased this prep station for my yard it is the nicest prep table i have seen for the price it is durable while still nice looking delivery was on time i did have a problem that some parts were missing from the box but they were replaced free of charge from the merchant	21
1	when i decided to purchase a weber kettle i knew that a side table was required several reviews have spoken about the table splitting i ordered mine from my local hardware store and when i picked it up i asked about finishing it the hardware folks \( and this is a really good store \) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table bottom line take some time and finish this product your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily	21
1	we already had 2 this was a gift for my father easy to make easy to clean does not make a mess on the bbq like other poultry roasters the pan underneath catches all of the drippings the secret cap keeps all of the moisture in the only way for the liquid to escape is through the chicken therefore very moist	21
1	we bought this for use at a beach house the grills provided at the houses are always dreadful it worked perfectly to grill shrimp hamburgers and hot dogs it is easy to transport and easy to use with very little assembly required	21
1	traditional grill brushes quickly clog with grill funk and the wires bend thus rendering them useless in a short time this has a pad that fits any grill and they can be removed and washed \( or replaced \) rated number one grill brush according to america 's test kitchen	21
0	this feeder was great the first year but the screw in connection cracked and leaked after one season	21
1	had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms \? try this one ! very nice design looks great simulated wood finish pole easy open and close we are very satisfied	21
1	i have had this smoker for about 8 years as i live on the east coast of florida it has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions sun rain heat salt air and the occasional 150 mph sandblasting the only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs \( without the wheels \) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom and the grills had to be replaced maintenance is a snap just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black she may not be the youngest lady at the ball but she still makes the best ribs chicken and steak	21
1	this weather station give reliable outdoor weather consistently i had a cheaper one that would lose the outside temperature on a regular basis that has not happened with the la crosse ws 8025 read the owners manual there are alot of features to set up	21
1	this is a great little barbecue from carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs this little guy does a great job	21
1	ca n't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works it installed as easily as expected and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced if the previous part is any indication it should last about 5 7 years hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence	21
1	i'm pretty happy with this detector it works really well i just wish i could turn the volume down the beep is ear piercing i started using headphones with it so now i have the pleasure of ear piercing beeps even closer to my ear drum this was purchased to help find a lost item in the backyard so it would have been nice to have the option of turning it down for the neighbors sake	21
1	i did buy this grill in a store and now that i search amazon for acessories i find that it is a lot cheaper here it is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking many parts are not as sturdy corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as i would expect	21
1	keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord i bought a 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord and i'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature i got this cord at lowes and it cost around 18 dollars the manual says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can also thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out got to go my ribs are almost done	21
0	ugh ! i agree this thing is never going to ship ! ! i am now looking at similar products not happy about this at all	21
1	i bought two of these sets along with the table and wow i get so many compliments they are beautiful on my new front porch i was skeptic at first because of the price but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more	21
0	do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill ! there were warnings with this product saying that it should n't be left outside but i figured it could n't be that bad a couple months later i discovered that my cutting board \( left on a covered porch through a mild california winter \) had completely split into several pieces for a 30 outdoor product this is really unacceptable a plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	21
1	using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill 1 \) an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank 2 \) the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank it does n't look like it is included as offered the quick connect adapter by itself wo n't do you any good	21
0	the chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head my stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can mind the instructions when you are putting it together if you do n't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around also the wood is almost orange in it 's color	21
0	i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii	21
1	my grandfather bought the bounty hunter sharp shooter 2 metal detector for my daughters and my self they are 5 and 8 and love going to the beach to search for quot treasure quot	21
