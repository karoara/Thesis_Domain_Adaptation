0	i received an email from txshirts stated that i should direct all inquiries to csr txshirts com i did this on two occasions and received no reply customer service finally contacted me only to ask why i had left negative feedback on amazon they stated they never received any email from me their gym shorts were not as described the description said covered elastic waistband instead i received an uncovered elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin their response \? i should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back but who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised \? \?	0

0	very cute i always get compliments but i wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up you 'd think i wear them everyday ! i'm just upset i paid over 60 for shoes that will barely last one season	0
0	i purchased these about 3 months ago they have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere i have been wearing them perhaps 2 3 times a week to the office and home they are already ripping in the back i would n't recommend them however i do get many compliments about how cute they are	0
0	i purchased 3 different embassy purses last december none of them were the quality i had hoped for and none were used as the gifts they were intended for in this case the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used i would not buy from this company again	0
0	i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap does n't hold my foot firmly in the shoe when i walked around in them i could feel them flopping also anytime i raised my foot \( to simulate my fiance taking off the garter \) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe so just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe for the price this is not worth the buy	0
0	the jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive the elastic and threads bite into your skin if you use this one for sports you will constantly be distracted the feel of the material used is very rough against your skin esp at the waist	0
0	i really really didnt like this product at all i hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying very hard to keep them tied also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off the product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all	0
0	i usually wear size 7m however this shoe of size 7m is way too small i have to return it to amazon and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself i will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	0
0	have n't worn it yet to test the quality however the structure is all wrong one leg is more narrow than than the other \( i could barely fit my leg into it \) and the waist is really high	0
0	not what i expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong even though i contacted the seller have received no response	0
0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
0	our 6 year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up he could not wait to get this belt we had purchased the police uniform earlier the first time i ordered the belt it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it when it finally arrived he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long it is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it it is less than 4 weeks old and probably wo n't make it through the rest of the month	0
0	i received the trousers in a timely manner they were what i expected although they did not fit i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company	0
0	this pillow is an inflated u that fits around your neck one of the problems is it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck this can get pretty irritating the longer you use it fortunately it is dirt cheap so then i guess you get what you pay for	0
0	shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige which leads you to think the color is mostly white the true color is neither ! there is absolutely no white in these shoes i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off white shoes not beige shoes no i did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so i kept them and i have worn them once but do not like the color at all the style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain the materials are an excellent quality if you like beige earthtones you will like these shoes	0
0	our company ordered these shirts from the texas shirt company while we were happy with the quality our order was missing 2 shirts over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for as if to say we were not telling the truth if you do n't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company	0
0	i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12 hour flight to japan however it was way too thin to keep her warm after using it for about an hour we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline since i spent over 40 dollars on this blanket i could n't even throw this away i had to haul it around for the entire trip i do not think it is worth 40 dollars 10 dollars blanket would do the same \( or even better \) job than this	0
0	this was a nightmare order i paid extra for expedited shipping to assure christmas arrival package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until after christmas disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr old grandson that his gift did n't make it the shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed they are also impossible to reach amazon could n't even get them on phone thank goodness the shoes fit i ca n't begin to imagine what a return would have been like the product is great	0
0	these shoes look great but are horrible running shoes the soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact i do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes they may be a good walking or all purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them i returned them and plan to try something else	0
0	i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me if people ca n't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out two thumbs down	0
0	beware this is a little girls camisole and cheap looking	0

0	i am a 38 ff and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back	0
0	this shirt was larger than i expected i got a 2x because i'm a 12 14 but it was way too big also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured	0
0	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store never again	0
0	i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn i now know why i pay 15 00 for two pair ofjockey 's	0
0	the fabric is a little stiff at first bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes the elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric after a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable while cheap and nicely packaged these things suck spend some money on decent underwear	0
0	i received the night gown tried it on and actually hated it the built in bra was loose as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top the straps are too wide the rest of the gown was okay although it too seemed too drapey and long i sent the gown back 3 weeks ago now and have still not received a refund i am very disappointed with the whole transaction product	0
0	the sizes listed do not print on the invoice instead army navy uses 'codes ' when they send the wrong sizes then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15 restocking fee plus return shipping	0
0	quality was terrible undersized or seconds later i saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1 3 of this price i would not recommend these to anyonei paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere it is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface i am disgusted with this product	0
0	the shoes were n't the color that i wanted them to be to me there cheap and are over priced ! the quality is not good they can easily be scuffed am definitely returning them ! !	0
0	these tops were cute for my 7 10 year old neices how in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things \?	0
0	the material 's good but the suit runs way too small i ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements but all my wobbly bits are poking out i do n't think i could wear this out in public ! not for curvy women !	0
0	i never received this item when i was promised it so it was cancelled and my account was credited	0
0	not the best fabric scratchy and see thru you get what you pay for on these	0
0	these socks are okay but after one wash they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz also they are too warm socks	0
0	i received the wrong size and color i returned the product and was told that a refund would be credited to my account i am still waiting was told that amazon forbids seller to ship a replacement item	0
0	shoes was not excalty the same as pic shown on web site it was kind of used	0
0	i actually had to send this back cause of the size they run really small	0
0	these shoes were very cute as i thought they would be from the pictures but because of the sides being so short they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking especially when going up stairs i returned them after only wearing them for 1 day	0
0	very poor quality falling apart at the seams also really long	0
0	these shoes are no longer being made in italy but in india the quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be i have worn this same style of bostonian \( marco \) for several years and was completely satisfied this is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great comfortable well constructed shoe return to having them made in italy !	0
0	if you see the description made in italy be careful ! they are made in india i have written to amazon to let them change but if you still see made in italy be careful ! everybody knows the difference	0
0	this adapter nearly caught fire the first time i used it watch out	0
0	so cheap the seams were n't sewn up all the way am returning	0
0	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
0	this has been the complaint of others i see but there is no sizing information for this product and consequently i cannot purchase as i don't know what i'm getting	0
0	get ee if you get these the d is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	0
0	the tie does have gorgeous color to it but when the description says good quality its a little off base	0
0	it did n't meet my expectations it was flimsy and wrinkled and looked messy	0
0	i just received this item and now i have to figure out how to return it this clock is a piece of trash i never could set it correctly each time i set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode the setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set if you buy this clock you will regret it	0
0	i ordered two bras and both were defective the left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing	0

0	beware this item is not a zip front hoodie as the item description says it is a pullover !	0
0	the other reviewer is spot on these are pretty \( but not truly mirrored \) and they broke after only 4 weeks use i bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price definitely not worth the 16	0
0	they 're pretty but flimsy very light construction the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock off gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face	0
0	i have worn jockeys for almost 20 years but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years the fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly and the underwear is for some unfathomable reason heavily perfumed ! i had to wash them at least 5 6 times to get the smell out plus some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight and some was so loose i could n't wear them and they were all the same size very inconsistent quality i do not recommend these anymore	0
0	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	0
0	the 2 bras i ordered were they same style it even said so on the labels attached however they both look and feel different the white has a lot more padding a rounder shape and the lining is tearing away from the padding \( part of the design \) the navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding \( which is what i wanted in the first place \) i was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had in addition i had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen i was not informed that it would have to be backordered not happy with my overall experience	0
0	the one size fits all does n't fit my slim body and the item looks made in china if you know what i mean rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong they look much classier than the transparent beads with nylon string of the string of bubbles panty	0
0	all i have had with this product is problems the clip in the middle kept popping open even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever do n't waste your money	0
0	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	0
0	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyi made a mistake by buying i	0
0	first i tried these pants on in my size and i looked like kramer in that episode where jerry dares him to wear jeans it was ridiculous i went back to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans i 've ever owned	0
0	very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color it does n't look as nice as what they show on the internet i returned it for a refund	0
0	product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back bad experience	0
0	only the front of the bag is actually beaded and the quality poor the original price should have been 5 or fewer to be reasonable this would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory	0
0	i 've had this coin purse not even 2 months now and i 've only used it about 7 times unfortunately the zipper broke already ! i could n't believe it	0
0	i purchased this item judging by its comfort factor all 's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place the straps slip off occassionally causing the shoes to come loose	0
0	i ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and i had the same problem with the turpentine smell i was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price i wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem i washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink i'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they do n't make my other clothes smell and i'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them	0
0	even for only 12 these were n't worth the money they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least 2 months since i have received them the smell has not dissipated they are extremely stiff so even if they did n't reek i still would n't wear them b c my feet would be in tatters by mid day i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes	0
0	i was able to track the progress of this item and it took almost two weeks after the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped i also paid for 2 day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me	0
0	also item shipped is not item pictured	0
0	the main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap i boughtit for my wife to carry all that stuff to work with out the strap it does not work i requested another one got it no strap on the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was if any thing over done gre	0
0	i just got my pair of sandals i regret i didnot read the customer review before buying although very cute and trendy sandles but are very uncomfortable	0
0	this is a very pretty high quality leather shoe the wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow if you are going for looks only they are good if you want any kind of foot comfort skip it	0
0	i love the style fabric fit extremely comfortable \( but it is a t shirt \) i'm 5'2 and it doesn't come past my hips	0
0	the shoes have sparkles all over and do n't serve my purpose i ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle a nice shoe to use during the night	0
0	i bought this for me but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight i have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner the shirts are not by any means high or even good quality	0
0	the material is nice but the size is too small i usually wear size xs for tops but for this tee the sleeve is too short	0
0	these underpants are too bulky and puffy my daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	0
0	i ordered 4 toddler long sleeved tees' in the same size i thought when i received the shipment all 4 tees' were different sizes even though they were all labeled the same size i have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small and the workmanship is questionable which translates into that i will not be able to give this item to my loved one for christmas	0
0	i would not recommend these hats you definately get what you pay for the sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed \( even for a 6 00 hat \) i basically threw it out the sad thing is i spent as much in shipping as i did on the product	0
0	i wish there was a rating of 0 this was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided the armband cut through and tore the back completely off i am returning it	0
0	i would have loved it if they sent it but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock on it 's way the company fessed up that they were out of the color that i chose the other color that they wanted to sub looked pretty bad so i cancelled	0
0	the pic that i ordered showed a knee length half slip instead i received 3 long half slips from her room i cannot use the long half slips and i sent them back also i had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and could n't find where to apply that so the cost was put on my visa thanks jeanne alle	0
0	this wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from brazil maybe is good for another country`s document	0
0	this product never made it to destination it was purchased with pants to match \( which were pin striped and did n't \) and it was never sent to the recipient nor was i invoiced so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point or even if they intend to send the correct pants \? \? \? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday and the wrong products otherwise i will not purchase from this seller again	0
0	straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro they are too short i tried to add velcro but that did n't work i had to give the shoes away the strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable would not recommend if you are on the heavy side	0
0	there 's a fine line between tacky and hip and these slippers are not it these slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person also the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber y fabric they 're not made for warmth all around disappointing	0
0	i have seen others wear these slides and i know adidas usually supplies an excellent product i did read the other reviews that warned of a need for breaking in the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process however i 've worn these slides for 2 months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless i continue to wear socks i am disappointed in the slide but i will stubbornly continue to wear them maybe some day they will be broken	0
0	these are the absolute worst things i have ever bought serves me right for by a sandal without ever having tried it on i walked around the block from my house with them and barely made it home they hurt the bottoms of my feet so badly i may need to take an extra day off of work the part of the sandal where it might normally be flat and cushioned has sharpened plastic spikes knifing the sole of your foot take your money and throw it right into the garbage and save yourself the misery of ever having worn these so called sandals and i love adidas	0
0	they were very cheaply made thank goodness they were just for little girls i would have been embarrassed if i 'd have ordered them for a gift for someone i know i should n't expect alot for 5 but i 'd have thought they 'd be better than they were	0
0	i love the cotton color just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks the show style it the most unconfortable of any clark shoe i have have there is something strange about the left shoe it give me a blister everytime i wear it	0
0	it looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that i cannot wear it	0
0	boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost 20 to return exchange	0
0	these boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that i wore them out although each boot split along the outside toe sole after approximately 10 wears these splits although tiny allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant west coast puddles i still wear them but now only for fashion instead of function	0
0	and poison ivy in my mouth would n't keep my hands warm these things itch like hell i know they 're wool but shut up i think whoever made these had to steal the wool no wonder they felt so bad get it \? steel wool \? ugh go away	0
0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together i do not suggest that anyone buy these	0
0	i wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie	0
0	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body my husband is 6' 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon amazon acted quickly to post the credit	0
0	the item looks cheap i ordered a medium size but it was 2x bigger than the regular size ugly	0
0	i quesss for the price you cant beat it but i think it should have said patch leather or leather pieces also the size runs larger than regular coats xl was really more like an xxl but like i said for the price you cant beat it i really should have invested more and got a better coat thank you dlan	0
0	did n't like the way these boots fit the souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked they also looked really wierd on they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways returned them and paid for the shipping myself	0
0	i broke through the toe on the second wearing lousy product	0
0	i keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices 9 10 or 11 where are they \? how do i find out	0
0	super low price advertised on 'select sizes and colors' oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price	0
0	this shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining the people who like it must be quite thin indeed it does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it does n't breathe very well either i am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me for the price you can do better even at someplace like target	0
0	easy to install we used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates you can still hear the engine running but no movement hardly any use at all maybe 10 times we tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you ca n't open it to see the inner workings i have never received a bad item from amazon before i am very disappointed with this product	0
0	these pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all if they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these i have lost the 3 pairs i biught to the self same calamity and always in public please save yourself the trouble by the way the lee version of these pants also do the same thing be afraid be very afraid	0
0	i had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions i wear they are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room he 's only 6 and when i had trained him i tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear in my personal thoughts are that men 's boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it	0
0	too bad there wasn't a rating of 0 star this is the worst piece of junk i ever bought first of all we were looking for a brand called sports afield this item fell under it when we did a search when it arrived it was some off the wall brand they were paper thin but thought maybe they were warm being it was from an army and navy store wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they served no purpose at all were not warm at all we washed them per directios on tag and shrunk so bad i don't think a 2 yr old could fit in them do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! jun	0

0	i wore gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks i discontinued using them because i started wearing different styles than the crew white standard now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes perhaps they sold the co or came under new management in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic making them basically worthless yippee	0

0	i am vey unhappy with the sales professional in nautica outlet stores i had a very bad experience at nautica store outlet stores the customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional they basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer other customers will still buy \( if that is the case why are prices slashed by 50 it is because people do not want to pay the full price \) i do not think i will ever buy from nautica a few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company	0

0	with a title like 'swirl skirt ' you 'd expect the fabric to be able to well swirl but the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable plus the cut \( of the size 12 at least \) was awkward giving my tummy a bubble that was n't even there and the last thing i want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is so i do n't recommed this item	0

0	i'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received but the case i received does n't cut it for the 60gb it fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them i do not recommend this product for the 60gb i suppose we zen 60gb owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	0

0	these shoes look great on however are extremely uncomfortable they run very small in size \( i went up 1 1 2 sizes from what i normally wear in sm brand \) i would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot	0
0	i do like this t shirt i liked the organic cotton and the general style but i will never buy american apparel again not only are they very labor and union unfriendly their ads exploitive of young girls \( i mean i can tolerate some of the young models in general but these are particularly young girls in amature porn looking situations \) but a friend 's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores i know i can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere ick	0

0	it clearly states for the shell material 100 nylon the price and the nylon shell was the main reason i bought the jacket the jacket is completely polyester the tag says shell 100 polyester and lining 100 polyester returning it would be pointless i'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information	0

0	these pants are fine if you have a very short rise but i ca n't imagine that they would fit most people i will be returning my order	0
0	the sizing on this cardigan is way off i ordered a women 's medium and it looks like a child size large the sleeves are about 4 too short and the overall profile is far too small to make matters worse i ordered it as a x mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and i'm stuck with a bad product	0
0	tommy what were you thinking \? although they are lovely to look at they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe bar none the shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk i even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem i was wrong take this design back to the drawing board and start again	0
0	for the money i spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around it gives a classic torpedo shape to the breasts does not offer any lift and is pretty much unwearable	0
0	i do n't think these skechers are made out of leather so i'm very disappointed i thought i was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer but with such a low price it was too good to be true	0
0	sometimes you get a good bargain cheap price for a good quality shoe this case is a classic you get what you pay for cheap price for a cheap shoe 1 \) this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe 2 \) no arch support whatsoever the rubber is almost too thick 3 \) i have serious doubths that this is a leather shoe feels like cheap vinyl at best 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute this paper like vinyl leather is pretty thin and cheap looking this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned \( this is my 14 pair	0
0	while they are certainly bold and noticeable and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information they are n't even close to being leather i do n't think i would have bought them if i saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller	0
0	tan color looks very synthetic cheapens look of shoe also very wide fitting	0
0	you 'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole is n't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me	0

0	one of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other genius ! not the result the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other grrr one more thing only the screen is protected by a clear plastic the wheel is not	0
0	did n't like these infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o	0
0	i never wear this top after having purchased it the stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them the shirt itself hangs very awkwardly i prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and therefore is n't very flattering i think i 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon generally i have been pleased with adidas products but this shirt did not work for me personally	0
0	i bought two of these hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event and quickly returned them since it took over two weeks for delivery i am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return refund the sashes are not the quality that i thought was represented by the term charmeuse and are thin and gauzy they came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz much of that must have been the packaging a quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction	0
0	the product would have been great but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes i requested xl long pants they sent size 3x pants so they are completely unusable and do not respond to my emails i would never order from them again	0
0	these are paper thin cotton and feel rough they may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! a big thumbs down from me and i'm usually a ck underwear fan	0
0	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon this store never again !	0
0	this bra was well made fabric very soft but the sizes were way off cup is cut to big it would be difficult to wear a scoop or v neck top as the cup covers to much of chest area would not buy this brand again or style again even for 7 each	0
0	i bought 2 lilyette embroidered minimizer bra 's here and both of them broke within one week i have never had such a negative experience with a product before where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment they broke right away since i do n't know how to get my money back or an adjustment this cost me approx 60 for a loser of a purchase my suggestion do n't waste your money on this one	0
0	i really wanted to like these but they just wo n't stay put it 's not a thong but it will be after a few hours of wear i usually love dkny products so i am disappointed	0
0	the product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was my son exchanged it	0
0	i never wanted to write one of these but i feel i have to i bought these boots they were great but one size too big so i tried to exchange them amazon does n't do exchanges apparently too difficult on top of this the price doubled after i bought them so now if i want the boots amazon will not honor the previous price this is something that any dime store would do but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't this is very disappointing and i would never recomend this company to anyone ever quite the opposite	0

0	i bought this watch from rei the first one 's electronics gave it up on the first night when i connected it to the pc on the second two the plastic housing started separating that 's right i had to return the watch three times the 3rd time i just wanted my money back also it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading too bad the watch sounded so good	0
0	please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop i received with battery problems it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it you have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner the suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all	0
0	i'm just not too crazy about this thing doesn't quite fit right or look right at least i only paid 5 bucks	0
0	thin cloth aweful insulation factor does not look good on me	0

0	i ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends juilliard they looked terrible because they were shiney the worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange	0
0	i have a 33 34 waste i bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32 34 waste the thing is too tight ! it almost blocks circulation to my legs plus the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch i was mostly disappointed with this product you can find a much better value at this price	0
0	sling is a misnomer for this gimmick think tourniquet and you 'll be closer to the reality there are several buttons and eyes on the sling to adjust the fit i tried every configuration and they all felt too tight a snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around despite the problems with the strap i like the briefs my recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap the sling technology needs more r d before it 's ready for the big time	0
0	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour if these briefs enhance a man 's profile at all it 's because they 're so darn tight it has nothing to do with the sling support and talk about low rise the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up i'm in pretty good shape but if these things shrink in the dryer i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore my advice anybody ordering c in briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear	0
0	bah this skirt looks weird and cheap it is not sewn on the bottom just cut	0
0	i bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match i'm really pissed off if you gonna buy this piece of junk beware with the size	0

0	this was something that i could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me 60 with shippng the leather is cheap it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker buyer beware would not buy again bottom grade leather	0
0	this is a very styling money clip however it is not like a big paper clip it opens like a butterfly then closes together with the strenght of the magnets it feels that your money and other cards might fall off i'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information	0
0	this is very cheaply made from very poor quality fabric the styling is not good and the fit is poor it does not resemble the photgraph i would pay \( at most \) 5 00 for this dress	0
0	the shoes look and wear great however the leather is pretty weak i think i must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter size scuff on it i will have to try to cover it up by oiling it obviously i do n't think this pair will last long at all	0
0	classic sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking \( and now spinning \? \) i hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor dangerous for working out and certainly not classic !	0
0	terrible bra what i mistake i made thinking this would work out for me terrible fit not made for dd cups or for that matter anyone over a b cup very disappointed	0

0	i bought 3 fleece with different size but the size of the fleece are not proper though it says medium large xl everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned	0
0	even though i bought these for 9 99 i still somewhat regret it the quality of the jacket is really poor every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed from the pockets to the zippers while wearing it the jacket smells like paint or what they used to bleach the colors on i hope the smell gets out after washing i am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when i wash it and onto my other clothes	0
0	i am a bit disappointed in the quality it looked like a possible reject off the factory line there are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets you really should not expect too much you may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain	0
0	if you are a weightlifter or bodybuilder the yoke piping will cut into your lats and pecs unless you buy a larger size than usual this restrictive band makes the jacket rather uncomfortable the velcro isn't quite right either the material itself is nice to the touch but the design is flawed wasn't worth even the sale price	0
0	i was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra i loved the cotton one hand closures and the lack of underwires it felt and looked great when i tried it on but after a few hours of wearing it had the classic problem of riding up in the back eventually i gave up wearing it at all i bought mine in a boutique where i was professionally fitted so i had the right size \( 34f \) i 'd recommend a bravada bra for larger sizes they consistently fit great and stay put	0

0	it 's true that you get what you pay for the good thing i can say aboutthis product is that the price is right but the quality was low and the fitwas poor however if you are strapped for money then they are certainlywearable but get a half size smaller than you usually would get	0

0	this jacket is worst outerwear that i have ever seen although the image might look good in here my size is usually between medium and large i ordered size medium however when i received and tried it on i end up look like wearing xxx large jacket also the craftmanship is very poor the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing i hate to return anything that i had order online because i have to waist my time to go to post office and i have pay the shipping and handling fee nevertheless i returned it yesterday please do n't waist your money on this order it 's not worth it at all	0

0	can you say p a i n \? this is what steve madden shoes are pain the soles must be made of cast iron the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough i am convinced that this madden person hates women if it were in my power i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs only standing walking and dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain	0
0	i ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever growing collection of credit cards grocery store cards insurance cards club cards hotel cards airline cards you get the point i was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the accardion from collapsing enough to zip close i ca n't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card i would not recommend this product	0
0	sadly this well designed item does n't work for me it comes detached from its clip while i'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off	0
0	i was disapointed with this jacket it was advertized as cashmere when i received it the label stated it was recycle cashmere and it did not look or feel like cashmere i was very disappointed and i returned the item	0

0	i bought this for a woman who is a small size eight one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose not this tiny shirt it looked all right when she opened the package but when she wore it it made the kid look as if she had flub it was inexpensive enough that i wo n't bother returning it but the item although well made was sized so small as to be useles	0
0	the pajamas are way to long they look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall	0
0	the trunks look great as long as you do n't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see through i guess that could be advantageous for some but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches	0
0	in my previous review very happy to receive my kc shoes but to my surprise these were a disappointment ! very cheap looking there were some visible defects \( noticed right away \) too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn tribeca 's are my favorite kc shoes but again if you wear a 9 go a size up for a better fit and comfortability good luck shoe shoppers	0
0	warning ! ! ! can not use button features to operate zen player because leather case is way too tight ! you can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem sadly it 's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk	0
0	i bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back very rude	0
0	i wore the boots one time and it will be the only time the boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable the material is so hard and did not give i even wore socks and that did not help i would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort	0
0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0
0	this is the only haynes t shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck it is light and drapes well but it is too light for printing	0

0	the product was not quite what i expected but i got a quick return to my satisfaction happy shopping	0
0	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts i usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form \( i played a college sport etc \) after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier \( free weights included \) perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this	0
0	i do n't know why but it is an ugly dress it does n't look like the pic maybe it 's my shape \( i have wide angular shoulders \) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny like	0
0	i was so disappointed in this product i bought the ad hook line and sinker thinking that the memory foam was a great idea that it would give me bilateral plantar fascitis suffering feet some long awaited relief after about 2 hrs of wear the foam is completely flat which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard save your money ! these are awful	0
0	while this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival it does not function to transmit the ipod via fm frequency it can hook to the ipod cradle the iopd and charge the ipod but it does not transmit the product was made in china but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return while i could probably process back through amazon and the seller it is not worth my effort all in all a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product	0
0	this device didnt work properly at all i lost my money on this purchase sorry but that 's how i feel	0
0	plugged it into my wife 's car set it listened to 1 2 of a song then went to remove it to try it in my car the plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter leaving part of the plug in the jack returned it satechi sent my refund quickly	0

0	i expected this bag to be much more comfortable but i have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags however i do like all the compartments for organizing	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0
0	does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only supplier does not carry the wide ones birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths not here no exchange possible now i'm stuck with shoes that do n't fit and midwest sports could n't care less i wo n't ever order from them again	0
0	never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items contacted seller and u p s both told me basically i was out 45 00 tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info on their web site live and learn wo n't shop amazon again ! thanks 4 nothing amazo	0
0	well it is a cool product and good idea to use but the bulb was broken in first 3 days we put the second one on dont know how long this second one will last we used it only few minutes in the morning when we need to get some cloth out of closet also it is not on line product only i found bed bath beyond has it and cvs has it they sell 9 99 without extra bulb but still misleading to say online only	0
0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0
0	this light worked for one day i should have known better because in the past i bought a tap light and it worked for only a few days too do n't waste your money	0
0	i have a small head and it makes it look huge ! maybe if i had a big head it would look alright pfff	0
0	i got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance thickness etc however it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes the heels and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places my 8 month olds' socks are fine however he does n't give them the wear of a three year old so if you have a baby these socks are great ! if you have a preschooler very poor choice	0
0	turn around time to receive item was good material of the shirt was sub par \( very thin \) for the price	0
0	these jeans were so very disappointing after hearing about pdc many times i was excited to own a pair but these jeans were made of cheap uncomfortable fabric and the style just does n't work i wo n't be buying pdc again	0

0	in theory this boot seemed perfect added some height came in perfectly wearable colors was made of real leather the price was unbeatable but \( yes unfortunately a big but \) like everything else which seems perfect it was perfectly flawed i did my research read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual but still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet totally crushing my veins i'm a big shoe collector and i can recognize a design error when i see one surprisingly that it came from this brand usually so quality reliable these boots are not meant for walking if you want to take a pretty picture in them they might fulfill that purpose	0
0	good features include many pockets bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining as a result the two pockets where i carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets	0
0	i thought this case would be like the ipod cases i have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod it is not the case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage the belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand does n't work well overall i would not recomend this product	0

0	save yourself the trouble and get the braided \( 3 line \) latex hose type of clothesline want suction cups rings snap hooks etc \? buy them for pennies at a drug store the problem with this clothesline is that you ca n't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines they slide down to the lowest point in the middle the only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they 'll dry is with a braided line period	0
0	the sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use i wo n't recommend it to anyone	0

0	i was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice just because gift when i opened the package i was really disappointed the color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together now i have to return the item because it just looks bad the problem with returning is the non refundable 7 50 to ship to me and the 5 95 i have to pay to ship it back to them i also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who could n't find my order	0

0	should n't amazon address this in some way \? if it is real i would buy it if it is fake \( and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score \) should n't this be off amazon 's site \? i think it becomes an issue of amazon 's credibility	0
0	i purchased a bag from this vendor thinking that by being affiliated with amazon that they were legit i got the bag and thought it looked fake the vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique the boutique confirmed that it was not authentic so i am returning the bag i got from moda party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney unauthentic bag	0

0	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	0

0	a year or so ago i bought several of these on sale they are poorly sized \( i have 4xt \) far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat i 'd avoid buying these	0

0	the fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful egyptian cotton but the bathrobe was huge it was more like a tent than a bathrobe it was an anniversary present for my wife \( size 8 \) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18 i was very disappointed that i could not have ordered at least a general size \( large medium or small \)	0
0	the phrase more efficient sourcing means that lands end is now buying these in china the pants arrived with a strange smell \( fishy odor \) the fit was odd and after one washing the fabric looked bad they went back asap ! i bought khakis from lands end for over a dozen years until this recent product change notice the past tense ownership by k mart holdings is definitely making an impact on the company	0

0	i would not buy this sweater it is flimsy and not very quality feeling the price was too good to be true	0
0	i found the wallet to be cheap looking and much smaller than the picture lead me to believe to call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product this is more of an insert to a wallet consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket i was n't pleased with the purchased expecting quite a bit more the 14 i spent i can go to target and get a wallet for less that what i paid for this one and it will be a full wallet not a sorry wannabe	0

0	these underwear were supposed to be size 34 but i could barely shimmy them up over my legs the fit was so tight that i could not wear them even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine they are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs if you must try these buy them at least 2 sizes larger but you would do better with another product	0
0	awful fit ! i usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me however the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls at first i thought it was the size so i purchased another and found the same issue steer clear of this model	0

0	i bought this product several weeks ago they looked nice but they are extremely sheer they ripped right away which was very disappointing	0
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	0
0	i bought a bunch of these shirts because i saw the good reviews at first i was happy they fit perfect then i washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than i ever seen shirts shrink in my life my medium shirts became xxs i wish i had a 8 year old son because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now	0

0	i have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats i'm very disappointed this is supposed to be a reversible coat however the hem of the black side is too long consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed and it does not look good at all the company needs to revise this pattern	0

0	i bought these shoes on a whim from amazon and was very disappointed and returned them i normally wear size 10m from adidas as i do with my metrum shoes and superstar iis yet with these shoes size 10m is way too small and quite painful they were returned if you order them make sure you get a larger wider size	0
0	i got the shoes for a while and i must say it was a total disappointment ! the look and heel were ok so does the gtx xcr however there is a major problem the shoes wo n't hold your foot ! the opens for the shoes lace \( the tounge \) are too big so the shoes wo n't hold your foot intact this is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe hate it ever since i put it on i have total of 3 pairs of gtx hikers now and this one is the one i regret to out money in	0

0	great concept but they slip off my ears way too often often enough that i stopped wearing them	0
0	ok i do n't why this bra is available in any size larger than a b cup because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust \( i see that is available here in 38 dd and i shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing \) it 's comfortable enough to be worn around the house under jammies for a little support when just relaxing but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day this bra wo n't do it the front closure just does n't allow for any lift or support unless you possess a smaller chest skip this one	0
0	i bought a sweatshirt from them the tote was a freebie and too small for much use anyway customer service was awful they sent me the wrong size a man 's size not the woman 's i was searching for \( and the photo had a woman wearing it ! she must have been an amazon \) i returned it the next day and they refused to accept the return saying it looked worn	0

0	i 've ordered from this seller before and the dress i recieved from the previously was perfect while delivered promptly this dress was not as it was pictured the bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill fitting unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it it 's basically too unflattering to wear	0
0	i got this because i thought it was a good deal but the clothes were n't very cute and were n't good quality i gave them all away i do n't recommend	0
0	i have several pairs of clarks shoes that are wonderful the lalita is very uncomfortable they are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub i was truly disappointed	0

0	extremely disappointed in this bag it was n't even heavily loaded just some folders with papers keys phone make up wallet on the very first use the strap broke before i even got home also the stitching is coming loose also the strap is not leather a big waste of money	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0
0	i purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit i ordered 2 suits through amazon com but to my surprise the size 34 that i ordered in reallity is a size 28 which makes it very unconfortable to wear so becareful when ordering look at the manufacturer 's sizing list \( very small letters \) to find the right size by the way i had to pay to return these items because i did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart not a happy camper	0
0	i purchased two of these sports bras based on brand price and product description this is a very uncomfortable bra for runners the seams chafe and it does not wick away moisture the slow shipping did n't help my opinion either it is a nice bra for less active endeavors	0
0	one shoe did not fit properly also did n't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking	0
0	i purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortableand because they looked like they were made of leather they are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and notattractive they will be returned	0
0	first of all they look cheaper than i thought they would look but the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the top of my foot in other words the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot and caused blisters i am hoping that if i keep trying to wear them the leather will soften up and become easier to wear	0
0	i guess you get what you pay for the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item it reminded me more of what i would find in my cat 's litter box than a magical device	0
0	in my case the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough my feet are size 14 and eee width \( but some ee made on wide lasts can fit \) the boots that i received were marked 14 ee but would n't even allow my feet half way in i wish they fit because they look good the quality is good and price unbeatable however i lost 8 50 at the ups when i sent them back	0

0	these booties are very cute and soft but they just slip right off my son 's feet they do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet the 'tongue' part just pulls right out not a good value for the money	0

0	this item was cancelled by amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order very poor customer servic	0
0	well i guess the title says most of it i am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so i have to put them in the washing machine with bleach a lot then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed i 've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dose n't work they look the same as before but they are comfortable i also like the high arch in them they are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives i would n't recommend them	0
0	these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color they do appear to be well stitched however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !	0

0	while the suit fits and looks great my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit it 's really the placement that bothered her there is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam which from a distance looks like one had an accident in their trunks thanks but no thanks these shorts are being returned	0

0	i 've been buying these t shirts for 20 years without issues about 9 months ago calvin klein changed the manufacturer these t shirts are nothing but crap now ! they are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads the price has n't gone down just the quality please do n't get ripped off do not buy these shirts here is another case of american immorality at it 's best let 's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours	0
0	i got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these unless the bottom of your feet are tough i would not get these	0
0	these pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems i look forward to your reply	0
0	at first glance you 'll think these are great but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt	0
0	the boots were not what i expected the pictures made the books look different then they actually were they were exremely wide and the sizing was off	0
0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0

0	i have worn jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time the product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! i shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings given the cost of panties and other similar products you 'd think the quality would be decent however jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product i guess until i can afford to spend substantially more for panties i'm stuck i will only pay sale prices	0

0	cute shoes but extremely uncomfortable i am not sure that i will get much wear out of these shoes i know my size but i starting to think they sent me the wrong pair i am so frustrated with amazon where shoes are concerned this is the 3rd pair of shoes i have bought that does not give me a good fit i suggest that you buy a 1 2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big it 's a catch 22	0
0	i was impressed by the look of this bag it really looked like it would seal the contents well unfortunately it did not i tried several times and each time the contents of the bag were soaked ! fortunately i tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool and only ended up with soggy money if i had put my cell phone and watch in the bag they would have been ruined i don't recommend it	0

0	i had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while i type they keep the office i work at at very cold temperatures these gloves seeemed perfect because many fingerless gloves do n't have fingerless thumbs but these gloves do the cost was only 2 99 for a pair of black or navy gloves i ordered the black pair well the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing there are many stray strands at the fingers they snag easily they are warm and i would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily but i did only pay 2 99 for them so i guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for	0
0	all over the neighbourhood now we 're getting divorced and it 's all your fault male power sheer bong thong ! i hate you	0
0	really uncomfortable i wore them twice and then threw them out they sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little and they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment not worth the 5 i paid	0
0	this review is n't really about the flip flops because theyre great why would you buy them here for 5 61 when you can get them at the store for 2 50 each \?	0
0	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve	0
0	i bought this dress for a trip i'm taking in one week should 've known better you get what you pay for that 's for sure this dress arrived balled up in a usps bag it did n't look anything like the picture shown on this site more like a slip than a slip dress and here 's the kicker it was ripped ! had two large snags on the back of the dress i'm sending it back and they better not try to charge me shipping i'm po 'd to the max and who knows if i 'll find a dress in time grrrr	0
0	i bought 2 sleepers sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on a real waste of my money	0
0	these shoes are cute but 1 \) they are made wide 2 \) the heel is a little bigger than 2 3 \) they are uncomfortable to walk in i think i could find a better pair at wal mart if i had to the company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a big two thumbs down for that	0
0	i had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products i received	0
0	these boots were the worst ever ! they were grossly missized and not as depicted the back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering when returned the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving never again	0
0	shipping was quick the shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer when soiled they clean up well some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most the little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip i was doing alot of walking the feet were really swollen i am pleased with the shoes so far	0
0	i never receive this item i want may money back or replace my order	0
0	the sleeves are long and the shirt is short i dont know about others but that is not how i like my clothes wont look to good with low rise jeans ! at least not with my average body i dont weight 95 pounds	0
0	these boots are very cute and comfortable however they are not leather as stated in the description they are clearly labeled all manmade materials on the inside of the boot since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal but the price i paid is not worth it for non leather boots	0
0	this order was most unsatisfactory i received the shoes with the security device attached i had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached i have yet to receive them i would advise customers to avoid orders	0
0	i purchased what i thought were deals from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed to get a pair of decent fitting sweats you have to pay the price and you wo n't regret it i hope this advice helps	0
0	and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas	0
0	i loved this bra when i first got it a year ago it gave me great support it looked great and i was the happiest with a bra that i have ever been my girls are in the f range so it has been difficult to find the right size a year later the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it i am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost 70 for one bra they are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time one year just does n't work for me	0
0	i absolutely loved this bra when i first put it on but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm i thought it was just a rare occurence but i bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime they cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them i am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	0
0	i had got these for my husband for christmas nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it	0
0	this bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable the lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material	0
0	this is a disgraceful garment i am not kidding when i say that the sweater is less than 1 mm thick the best description that i could give you is tracing paper it is virtually see through when i put it on for the first time all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed there is also an obnoxious z on the left chest area very tacky this will be in the very back of my closet until i get around to donating it or throwing it away miserable miserable purchase	0
0	they are warm and comfortable while they last all of the sheep skin inside has fallen out there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper the outside of the slipper still looks like new it is sort of depressing they only lasted 3 4 months	0
0	i bought these based on a previous review after wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart maybe the quality control person was out that day \? \? \? i returned them and got a full refund	0
0	not happy at all with these slippers do not buy them they lasted 3 4 week and then he inside was shot	0
0	these slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things i 've ever put my feet into the concept is good but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger that might solve the length discomfort but there still is n't sufficient heighth comfort they felt like an all encompassing vise squeezing my feet so tightly that i had to remove them to gain relief very uncomfortable	0
0	those are a good shoes but the delivery provide service is the worst i buy the shoes dic 15 06 in expedite service 1 3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail bad deal to me	0
0	i bought these at target for my sons my six year old wore his two months until they fell apart not too long in my opinion	0
0	very cute but have a funky balance wobly and on the vergeof falling over not comftorable poorly designe	0
0	really cute boots but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they were n't supported and about to slide out the 4 heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and i had to take these off after half a day my next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help	0
0	i had this bag on my wishlist and got it for christmas i wanted it for when i take daytrips to the beach i am really disappointed with the size it 's pretty deep but not very wide at all no way i 'll be able to take everything i need to the beach in this bag still i 'll be able to use it for other things	0

0	these pants were washed one time following the washing instructions they were not put in the dryer and they shrunk not only around but lengthwise i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems i look forward to your reply	0
0	the colors of bandannas i ordered were not the colors i received the invoice sent with the bandannas did not confirm the colors i ordered so i did not have proff that several errors were made but i know what i ordered i was concerned after placing the order because the colors were not stated on the checkout page but since i had ordered them before i thought there would not be a problem	0
0	i ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team 's competition but i only received 12 in the mail the packing slip said 16 and i was charged for the 16 it was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time	0
0	i purchased the dopp money clip and card holder for a specific vacation cruise it is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed one it will only hold about six bills and two it demagnetized my room key card twice over eight days realizing this could also demagnetize my regular credit cards i removed them from the card holder i am reluctant to use the money clip again	0
0	even though i favor leather every once in a while a pleather product comes along that i really appreciate well these boots sadly are not in that category the pleather started cracking after i wore the boots x3 the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling the sad part is that for the amount of money that i spend on these boots i could have bought a pair of leather ones after x mas	0
0	i am solidly a size medium but i was swimming in this jacket i think it is more of an xl i 'd say the medium is for someone 5'10 and 250lbs	0
0	there was no picture of this selection so i guessed it was a ringer type t shirt instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching i never wore it but gave it to goodwill	0
0	i ordered this dress on march 6th i recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by march 8th on march 16th i receive an email saying that they are out the size i wanted and my order has been canceled this is unacceptable from a business i should have been notified by march 9th that the dress had not been shipped i have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress thanks alot	0
0	i was very dissappointed by this item it arrived folded into a 6x6 square bag and was very creased when opened it will take considerable pressing to try and get it out the fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well the length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap the return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	0
0	very nice prints but the quality of the briefs is not good to top it one of the briefs was even damaged i guess the maker does n't have a quality control department overall a bad buy	0
0	beware the size is not true size fitmy small turn out to be something that fits like a large from some other brands this is not a small it 's loose fitting and it 's a straight line cut it 's really bad it 's so disappointing everything doesnt holds in places it doesnt look like the photo at all the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy and if you are a medium you need a small for this dress and it will still fit loosly on you that 's how big of a dress this is i'm returning it	0
0	size 9 5 fit like it was an 8 i wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in and was unable to walk in them at all without pain i 've bought steve madden before many times and know they run slightly small but this pair was ridiculously small and i suspect perhaps mis labeled	0
0	i only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute other than that they were quite unusable i usually wear a size 7 but i could not even get my foot into these shoes and they are quite hard had to get rid of them	0
0	i acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit i even complimented her on them i liked so much how they looked on her that i took the time to locate them online \( amazon \) i ordered them with much anticipation that i would also look cute in them needless to say looks are deceiving perhaps they felt better on her than they did on me but i felt like i was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic i was disappointed if there 's nothing i 've learned being a woman in her mid 30s i come to realize that there 's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes	0
0	these shoes are not as cute as they appear the heel is really 2 5 the material is cheap the fit is too wide the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in etc etc etc on a positive note it 's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress be warned the company claims that all their shoes have 2 heels when they do n't and they charge tax on shipping charges	0
0	the footbed on these clogs is very comfortable but buyer beware the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily \( in my case after two wearings \) the seller 's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside they wo n't take them back i had to sew the buckles back on in my opinion 100 shoes should n't need to be repaired after two wearings the suede is also much darker than the picture still a pleasant color but not what i expected when i ordered	0
0	my daughter bought these herself because she could n't afford the real birky 's she bought them in august 2006 now november 18 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday wasted pair of shoes anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys \? \? pat mother of msu college freshman	0
0	this bag is much smaller then i was expecting the zippers do not open shut easily i was very disapointed	0
0	i have purchased ak in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed the shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy i would not recommend this shoe to anyone	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0
0	wow the headband on this skull cap is cutting off mycirculation ! it is way too tight for casual wear also the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty hose andyour hair will poke through if you have a buzz cut like me if you 're not an athlete then do n't buy this skull cap it 's meant primarily for bald football players to wearunder their helmets	0
0	i ordered 4 of them because they were on sale but all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be in addition the fabric is bad there are tores in all of the edges	0
0	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark a cotton cotton blend or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses	0
0	this bra has an akward fit i had to return it a better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria 's secret	0
0	i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting by the end of my fitting my feet were throbbing red and pinched literally my pinky toe was purple i bought my true size but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger they must just be really narrow	0
0	the advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving because it does n't properly show it from what i saw on the amazon site i thought the wallet will be much bigger amazon does n't give measurements of the product and there are not enough pictures of the it basicly it is n't worth it to buy a product if i'm not sure of how it looks like now i have a wallet that my husband does not want and i can do nothing with it i feel that i wasted 25 00	0

0	i am a 44dd i am having the hardest time finding a good bra i ordered this one and i am a little dissapointed the underwires in the front poke out and make it look like i have these bones sticking straight out of my chest everthing else is ok no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone	0
0	ordered gray they shipped black since it is from canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges minor inconvenience yet still folks i ordered gray ! pants are also not new the tags are ripped and torn it looks like return or wholesale merchandise i feel cheated angry but mostly just disappointed for shame people for shame	0
0	need to use a belt definitively does not look like the picture if you do not use a belt you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top	0
0	the color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture also from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows good customer support though i could n't return it because of being a gift	0
0	this boot looked so much better online for this boot to be by nine west it looked very cheap i was very disappointed with this product that i returned it but i'm still waiting for my refund ! !	0
0	these boots look good on the first wear i bought the black patent boots and after one not so wild night they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material if you need boots for one night for that perfect outfit these will suffice	0
0	the elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear otherwise the quality of the lace shoes is good i 'd wear them if the elastic did n't dig into my foot \( i have small feet too ! \)	0
0	poor design and fit such that after 4 5 wears the front of both shoes wore out into a hole not recommended	0

0	the stockings were not in the package and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place my girlfriend was disappointed and i felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call i will not do business with this company again	0
0	this product worked well in holding up a strapless bra but after a few hours my skin developed a blister underneath the tape i would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters so use this product with caution	0
0	horrible must go through hell to return it too they wo n't give you back the shipping to send it to you just the cost of the item do not buy do not recommend	0

0	i could not believe the quality in these shoes horrible ! the material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper they have an awful smell and are uncomfortable i bought chinese shoes in china town for 2 they were wonderfully comfortable still smelled funny but they were awesome these are not !	0
0	it is a horrible item if i could have given this hairagami a no star rating i would have and to think i wasted almost 20 for this junk it snaps unexpectedly all the time and always while you are twirling the hair it totally tangles the hair it is a nightmare to get out of your child's hair my oldest 12 really wanted this hairagami and was totally disappointed she told all her friends not to buy it	0
0	material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light it 's very dissappointing for an izod product i would have returned it had i not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging	0

0	i realize this is n't an expensive bra but i expected it to at least fit ! i 've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy ! the band was way too big and the cups were way too small needless to say i'm returning it save your money ladies ! on top of that it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock even though figleaves displayed the item as in stock this is the third time figleaves has done this for amazon items i think i 'll skip buying from them in the future	0
0	the mask is way too tight either that or i just have an abnormally big head which i do n't think i do it should be adjustable and it 's not would not recommend this	0
0	the battery function did n't work discovered poor battery wiring inside i might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering i'm not surprised by the crude construction from a 11 item however the hand grips themselves are worth the money no more cramped hands	0
0	we received this product in a clear plastic molded container however there were no instructions at all nor was there any label we immediately thought this must not be a new product not knowing exactly how to attach it to the psp or detach it one of the clips has broken we also have more questions can the battery inside this charger be replaced \? if so what kind is it \? i think we 'll be returning this product	0
0	when i got ordered these shoes i was so excited because the picture looked so nice do not be deceived by its looks i saw it in another store and i tried it on for fun the shoe fits poorly and its actually really ugly i would definitely not reccomend it to any one	0
0	i bought this for the flashlight feature you have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on also the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on the buttons on the front are cheap and do n't seem like they 'll last very long	0
0	you have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly they only fit properly for one wearing stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry i have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought i would try these you get what you pay for applies to this product	0
0	these socks were thin large and horrible they had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently absolutely worthless	0
0	i received the smart tool dynamo instead of the illuminator very disappointed because i ordered 5 for xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder	0
0	illuminator is shown in ad but a generic brand was shipped to me the light was n't as bright and it was n't made very well the crank was cheaply made and the button that you press did n't work every time	0
0	i was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings i have purchased leg avenue before and found them to be excellent however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone 's truck brand as a matter of fact i 've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings ! leg avenue is now off my list ! of course if they priced them three for a dollar now that might be worth the price	0
0	this product was disappointing not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected i guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit	0
0	i wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe should not happen at nearly 6 a pair and a logo of gold toe	0
0	these socks are advertised as seamless toe socks they are very thin and they do have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe not only does the seam press into the toe but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself terrible product	0
0	i was very disappointed with this bra i would definately not recommend it if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead this bra looks sexy but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra \( at least not for a size 38dd \)	0
0	this listing ise n't correct item nts1 is a nylon tank top shirt not a t shirt	0
0	i bought this bra because the ad says 100 cotton there is no cotton in this bra it is 86 nylon and 14 elastane if you want a cotton bra this is not for you	0
0	although the description of these booties says they run true to size they do not ! i ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter 's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet now i have to pay more shipping for an exchange not a great transaction experience	0
0	this bag was not what i expected the leather was cheap and it was n't really big enough to fit much i would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items paper	0
0	i have the same jacket in black but i bought this from elsewhere what a rip off it is it is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day i had to remove atleast 20 25 of the feathers since they peek so much i doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers ! ! ! do not buy	0
0	this jacket is extremely poorly made i have it in black but i should say black and white because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through	0
0	when i purchased this i was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped the skin is so thin that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons the belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that i used it do n't waste your money spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while	0
0	when you buy natori you expect the best but this product just is n't up to their usual high standard most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings for 20 dollars they should be awesome they are n't my favorite panty right now is a nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks i have n't seen them online but this is worth a trip to the store	0
0	i have found gerber brand clothing to be disappointing the do n't stand up to laundering very well in that they shrink quite a bit they already seem small for the size on the label but it gets worse after you wash and dry them \( even on the delicate cycle \) my 6 week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3 6 months ! it 's worth spending the extra money for a better brand such as carter 's	0
0	this is an okay jacket the padding in it is okay sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal there is no liner and you will get cold riding at night overall the jacket has only 2 layers and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up	0
0	i thought i was on the same page as crocs when i ordered the pwclog it confusing i thought i was ordering a sale on crocs they are not crocs	0
0	i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke i love the way they look but not the quality of them i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them	0
0	why \? i do not know but be more carefully anbout it	0
0	for starters this shirt is not a lighter royal blue like it is pictured it is a very dark navy blue very dark also the sizes run big every t shirt i own is a size large this shirt is a size large but is way too big be warned	0
0	although very cute crocs are not good shoes they are a cheap plastic shoe that is over priced and not comfortable at all i bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are non slip she did slip in them many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet they are the right size but i just think they are not made well do n't go for the hype they are a useless shoe	0
0	first of all they dont even go up to the thigh ! they attempt to sit right above the knee ! ! second they do not stay up at all whatsoever ! ! ! i was sooooo embarrassed i went out with them on and every ten seconds i was pulling them back up i am 5'3 and i weigh about 125 i'm average these are a joke price is too good to be true do not bu	0

0	my review appears to be inconsistent with the others weeks after i received my jacket i had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places this is not following heavy use but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office in addition the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look when considering the cost of the jacket shipping and repairs i should have to gone to macys and purchased a nicer jacket	0
0	waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit very unhappy with return policy wondering if i 'll ever get my credit	0
0	i just received this dress today not only was it cheaply made \( there are rhinestones missing threads and it does n't flow smoothly \) the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight also the support is badly made i have a very small bust but i do n't think this would compliment anyone who is n't built like barbie definitely would n't recommend it looks great in the picture but it 's not being modelled on a real person	0
0	first of all they did n't sent me the pictured panties but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print butt ugly second they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse returned right away very disappointing	0
0	not very good pictures or description wallet was smaller than i expected quality was ok not competitively priced	0
0	so i just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks what a dissapointment i open the box and immediately i see what appears to be a defect the inside of the shoe \( like on your right foot the left side not the right \) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area including smudging on the asics logo this was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged also the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe poorly done last time i will ever buy asics shoes again	0

0	lookslike it would be a nice product but it 's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches my baby is very long and just does n't fit wish target amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing	0
0	we have not opened the package the item is advertised as one size without a notice that the one size is not one size fits all it is xl \( grand plus for those that speak french \) my wife wears a size 2 or 4 obviously this was a waste of money	0
0	this hoodie is very poorly made i bought a blue version and i had to return it after washing it in cold water on gentle it faded substantially changed shape and the threading came loose not recommended ! !	0
0	these garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear	0

0	these bras do not hold up very well i started wearing them in june after the birth of my son and i have already had to throw both of them away six months later	0
0	i ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product i received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame that is where the only star i am giving is coming from i am concerned with having a good supportive bra i have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years this bra is the farthest thing from supportive i had to cut the straps and re sew them to make them shorter so i could even where it the material is soft but thin and stretchy i have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and i will not again	0
0	i have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable i could not wait to take it off champion should stick to making sports bra do not buy this bra or you will suffer plus it looks much thinner in the picture it is really thick it feels like a maternity bra ugh	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
0	on sept 17 i ordered a cashmere wrap i finally got the company 's attention when i placed a negative review on this forum i was told if i removed the review after recieving the item i would be credited for shipping the item arrived oct 16 as of today november 20 my credit card had not been credited i emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days	0
0	ok i am not overly modest and 95 of the shorts pants i buy fit when i purchase and xl size these shorts are made for anorexic bean poles if you have thighs legs or even a tiny bit of junk in the trunk forget it these are designed for 16 year old girls not men shipping is also super slow	0
0	the picture of the shoes was deceiving did not want ankle strap you could notgo by the picture which is how you do online shopping returned the shoes	0
0	buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe the real shoe has an ankle strap also the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller i had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs	0
0	the skin is fine and all the extras were nice the one thing i really needed was a good elastic band for the arm this product does not have a good elastic band it 's too thin and not durable enough	0
0	these boots look very nice but unfortunately it is way too narrow \( and i have narrow feet \) my whole foot felt squashed back to amazon it goes	0
0	this shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot	0
0	these socks do not fit the sizes specified the elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet i gave them to my 12 yr old son and they were too tight on him also i threw them out this is the first and last time i will buy those socks the reebok sneakers are great though	0
0	i wear a lot of rockport shoes almost exclusively i was very disappointed in these shoes they are the same size as all of the other rockports i have yet they are too small	0
0	same as the capezio jazz shoes way to small for normal people none of the kids \( 48 \) could fit into the shoes in the sizes that where recommended all had to go up at least 2 3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides very frustrating makes me want to start my own dance shoe business not for profit	0
0	not comfortable the thong between your toes is too thick and too tight if you are looking for toeless this is not the way to go try dkny hosiery instead expensive but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable	0
0	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces	0
0	i wish i could give them 5 stars i got these to replace a pair of new balance 999 that i had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around 170 should be really good i could n't be more wrong the lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day ! ! ! stay away at all cost	0
0	i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it i was disappointed the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me	0
0	bag was well made but too small ca n't put much in it nice well made leather bag if it was three times bigger it would be a perfect	0
0	i was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991 however i had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had the shoe is hard uncomfortable and much wider than the 991 my foot slides around everywhere i recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first do n't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991	0
0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
0	big for the size advertised not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals hoped it would shrink since i'm a perfect 6 and it did n't disappointed	0
0	this is the smallest extra large i have ever bought my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it 's super tight on her this was very disappointing to say the least if you normally wear a small in other things i would suggest you buy the extra large in this the quality of the material is great that 's what made me even give this product a 2	0
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old luvable friend 's onsies are awful the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies and the velcro does n't even stick they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old lastly even the shirt tag stinks it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son shame on them for making such a cheap product shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !	0
0	i was excited to finally find a black nursing bra this bra fits horribly do not buy if you are dd e cup ! this bra is uncomfortable and does n't hold your goods properly	0
0	while i ca n't agree with the other reviewer re the quality of the 560 jeans \( it seems excellent to me having owned six pairs over the last two years which i wear to work every day \) and certainly as men 's jeans i do n't think they 're out of style i do have to say amazon 's price on this item is far far out of line you can find these same jeans online elsewhere for 38 \( with free or cheap shipping \) meaning the cost is nearly 20 less than what amazon is charging	0
0	out of style ! all the girls make fun of me for wearing levi jeans they say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style the fit quality durability and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago there is definitely a noticeable difference and not a positive one the price far exceeds the value overpriced !	0
0	these slippers are very comfy and fit true to size however the fabric part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper it 's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when i walk the slippers fall off my feet i will not purchase these slippers again	0
0	this seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap when i opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off when i emailed alys 's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable needless to say i do n't recommend this bra	0
0	i really wanted this product to work but it really did n't help with my problem i always have erect nipples no matter what and this really does n't fully flatten them or make them less noticeable with t shirts etc	0
0	i was so disappointed in these i am full busted \( 38dd \) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time i used a band aid and it did a better job these provided no help at all and they really hurt taking them off	0
0	these did n't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much they do have great adhesive also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola because they are pretty small i used every pair just thinking i was putting them on poorly but everytime i was a pokin	0
0	the nippits did n't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
0	it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces look at tunebelt they have one that fits pretty good	0
0	i was disappointed when i got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin i emailed the company i bought them from and requested an exchange return many times they never responded and i ended up keeping the shoes as i needed them for work i would not purchase from this company again	0
0	i would n't order from andrew christion again ! i ordered three shirts more than a month ago they sent only two and never responded to my emails ! where 's my shirt ! ! \?	0
0	i was givin this case for christmas and i thought it was great for the first month then i took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen i am a total scratch freak but still i was really mad warning if you do n't like your ipod scratched do not get this case ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0
0	i purchased a ipod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside on the inside of the case they 've got some ruff edges that will damage you ipod screen if you 'd like scratches on your ipod screen then purchase this case but if you 'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then stay away from this case !	0
0	the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes i have used it about three or four times and i do n't feel it will last much longer what there was of it seemed to work well but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use	0
0	i purchased the crocs butter thinking it would be something special just for crocs shoes as soon as i opened the package i noticed the crocs butter is just like any other shoe buffer cleaner with the black sponge i already own two shoe buffers one of which i received free with purchase from a local shoe store needless to say i returned the crocs butter since it 's not worth 4 95 plus 10 shipping which i was not refunded what a crock	0
0	these were not as expected there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels there was just an open hole he has problems using these too !	0
0	this shoe is extrememly uncomfortable ! ! the straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail i wo n't ever wear them again	0
0	the jacket we received had weird arms they had a hole for the thumb and then another for the rest of the fingers great for skiing or snowboarding but for casual use in florida winter was n't very practical columbia in general is a company i swear by	0
0	i realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3x is in trouble in the conservation of fabric but this manutacturer must be very generous the garment was so large i could have made two out of the one unit this certainly was an error in sizing or i am smaller than i thought i hesitate to purchase from this retailer because i can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle	0
0	i hate this bra the elastic band is not soft and rolls up as the day wears on shoulder straps are skinny inadequate only good thing is that it is low cut i prefer my 12 nursing bras purchased at wal mart i only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low cut	0
0	these gloves should really be called simulation leather they are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather i wouldnt feel comfortable riding a motorcycle with these if you hit the pavent with them they 'd probably just vaporize	0
0	as much as seller might like this backpack to be 11 by 8 5 by 6 5 the one i 've got is surely not that big \( 10 x8 x4 at best ! \) and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it \( and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise was it what they were aiming for \? \) the material is ok so is the craftsmanship but the fact that they lied \( yes ! l i e d ! \) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal a great dissapointment ! ! !	0
0	i have had my bag for a couple of months the liner on the inside has already ripped	0
0	i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips !	0
0	i ordered a 11 5eee size slip on shoe despite the labelling in the shoes they felt more like 12 5ee in other words too tight across the arch and so loose on the heel they wore like flip flops unfortunately the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them which voids the company 's product return policy anybody want a worn once pair of shoes cheap \?	0
0	the top was very roughly finished the end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place because the seams on it were very rough so i had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be the top got completely ruined on the first wash i followed the instructions to a t during washing but still the blue on the top ran and i had to throw it away the skirt is still fine after washing it twice but i would not recommend this outfit to anybody	0
0	i love vanity fair their bras just fit me perfectly when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair not only that but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material i tried it on in hopes it may fit it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on not because of size it was bulky rough and obviously inexpensively made the tag said something along the lines of made in hong kong	0
0	the main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order amazon had said they would rectify the error although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle buckle and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties and a different strap entirely	0
0	first time i 've ordered a product from leg avenue and it 'll probably be my last ! i opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 runs in one of the legs before i even tried them on what a waste of money and if i would pay to ship them back for another pair then i 've already put way too much money into what should be an inexpensive product	0
0	the glasses look fine from a far distance they are produced very carelessly given that it 's on sale the quality can not be as high as normal however it should not that bad	0
0	i thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase when i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag which was in my pocket i then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed	0
0	i was disappointed with the shoes when i received them on the website the shoes looked gold in color and were described as gold but when i received the shoes they were beige i am sorry to say that i could not wear the shoes	0
0	these are not ray bans ! they should not come up when i do a search for ray bans get your cheap crap out of my search for genuine ray bans	0
0	i got two problems with this here lingeree 1 that model at the top of the page is sparkin hot how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend \? eh \? false advertizing if ya ask me their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does or a warnin label objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear 2 i paid 14 95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on my suggestion go for the crotchless or the bustless or the fishnet but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend	0
0	my son picked out these shoes for basketball he liked them at first and gave them time to get broke in but the outsides of the shoes had no give most shoe will form to your foot these did not at the end of third stripe you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe we had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better nice looking shoe but not the greatest fit	0
0	i have been wearing boyshorts for ages and i gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute the fit is horrible ! ! ! the seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places i mean the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies ! i even bought them a size larger because some brands tend to fit a little snug	0
0	i ordered this product from general discounters and i have tried for 4 wks and still i have not gotten a response from them and i havent received my order as far as the actual cologne it is nice but order it from that company and you 'll not get to smell it because you wont get it all other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller	0
0	i am not happy with what i got in the mail today i thought i was getting a real used fencing foil instead i got a kids plastic fencing sword ! sending it back asap to get my account credited for sure ! why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil	0
0	i bought this item because it said optional belt clip the belt clip is only optional if you opt to leave it on and not use it you cannot opt to take it off i would not call this belt clip optional i would call it will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in	0
0	i wish i did not order this one the picture looks nice but when i got it today i really got disappointed when you look at it closer the wood beads sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking i wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads	0
0	i ordered 5 of these belt buckles the company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they did n't actually have this belt i needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it was n't in stock i could have ordered it elsewhere	0
0	these tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini however as another reviewer noted there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin i'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that i own are for my size medium 32 34 streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam but i 've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this maybe buying the next size up would work but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and i like keeping 'em close to home	0
0	i bought some of these i find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable other than that they are ok but because of this i mostly wear these inside out	0
0	look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs the elance is poorly made and designed jockey is barely evern trying look on the web guys there are better choices jockey 's elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame	0
0	i am not leaking so i do n't need those annoying papery pads but i would still like a little padded protection so i was hoping this bra would do the trick well it served that purpose alright but it was a pain as far as nursing went the clasp was difficult to release with one hand the cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult worst of all the underwire gave me a rash ! this bra may work for some but not for me	0
0	like a permanent wedgie these kept riding up my crack i do n't recommend these at all the liquid metallic look is only useful if you 're going to be a male stripper otherwise you 've got liquid metal up your crack not very appealing	0
0	you ca n't beat this shoe for comfort but they 're definately cuter in the picture i thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel did n't quite seem to fit the shoe i returned them	0
0	i agree cup had too much left at the end and all i can say is pointy	0
0	the bra cup itself is too big for my chest and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30 's and 40 's it is not at all comfortable blah ! and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure	0
0	i bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for christmas she loved it the downside the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off we would have returned it but it was christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat we ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine ! i guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone 's head	0
0	this hat is not suitable for a small child it is way too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff if i had been there when it arrived i would have sent it back	0
0	these slippers are anything but comfortable besides the sizing being to small i felt like i was putting my foot into a kid 's slipper the width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone 's foot and the inside material is also anything but comfortable	0
0	there was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit complete waste of money \( yeah i realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither \) didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever point being i didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when i was out of town and didnt have time to return it ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me just be smart	0
0	this is a piece of garbage it 's cute looking and just barely will fit just your ds and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth but as far as any kind of long term travel functionality look elsewhere the charger does n't fit in there very well which i do n't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case i was able to squeeze both my ds lite and the charger in there for awhile but recently the zipper broke and i had to split it apart to get to my stuff and now it 's useless if all you want is something to carry just the ds in this is a decent option otherwise forget it	0
0	i purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her nintendo ds lite the case does not fit at all and i have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game	0
0	this carrying case was a terrible purchase the zipper broke within hours and the nintendo ds lite does n't really fit into it very well i was very disappointed my six year old used his own money to buy a g pak case which is a much better case for the nintendo ds lite	0
0	until today 01 09 2007 i did not yet receive item hi cut brief 7 8701 1176 xl light beigenor bali lace trim moderate control hi cut brief 8044 xl light beigeboth purchased on 11 30 200	0
0	the product was received on 6 18 when i tried it on i found it to be too large utilizing the return form included with the order i completed it and returned the item via ups on 6 20 i'm still not sure about the return policy ! when i had n't heard from the uniform company after about 2 weeks i called them i was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that i needed large was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped i'm still waiting ! when i get the product i can properly review it	0
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0
0	i ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my p o box but the seller used ups which wo n't send packages to p o boxes so i gave an alternate address i 've never recieved the scrubs for my friend i 've sent e mails inquiring about my order and have n't recieved any word back i 've been cheated out of my money	0
0	these cover ups are very thin a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun the colors are pretty but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps they are cheap good thing because i ca n't imagine what to use them for i 'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item	0
0	i was a bit dissapointed i know its my fault i did n't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering it should be the same thing you 're looking physically the thing you 're gonna buy ! ! ! i saw this beautifull gray orange stripes and got green white strip s its very easy to put a picture of the product ! ! regard	0
0	just did n't like the way they turned out medium size ran way too big for me too i did n't know how to return so i just kept them	0
0	although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie how to lose a guy in 10 days the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust this made me look awkward and did not fit well do n't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as i did	0
0	nice stretchy material but too short and i'm usually a 16 18 the g string is not even close to plus size do n't even bother	0
0	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body my husband is 6' 178 pounds so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit but this one looked like a stiff kite on him be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon amazon acted quickly to post the credit	0
0	first let me say that i was very impressed with the shipping speed of this hat which was nice because i bought this as a last minute gift though with that said there is a big difference between straw and straw paper this hat is straw paper i'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain i really think amazon should improve this hat 's description	0
0	i guess that i cannot properly review this item i never received it this is the second time that i ordered from this same company anderson christian with almost the same results the company billed my credit card upon ordering and then sent one e mail saying that the items that i ordered are on back order i eventually cancelled the order due to the fact that i live overseas at the moment i order a lot of things online i will not be ordering from this company again	0
0	be careful this runs really small i got the 18 24 for my 14 month old and it would fit better on an average 6 month old otherwise it seems of nice quality	0
0	i bought these slippers as a present for my husband for christmas i ca n't return them because he wore them for a day these slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers the shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left do n't waste your money	0
0	if your loved one is a beautiful 5'7 130 lb slender lady like mine forget about this piece of clothing if however she is a 5'1 180 lb gorgeous petite girl this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for you 'll have lots of fun first trying to put it on her then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself fun that will come after that is purely optional	0
0	these look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick ruining the shoes completely do not buy them	0
0	the little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after i got the sandals i have had these sandals before and this did n't happen maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower and thus more fragile nubs all i know is they are junk	0
0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in they look good and are comfortable but only to walk in there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones but i ca n't use the old ones the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location now i have to look again	0
0	the scarf itched my neck smelled funny and was not the color of ivory it was beige it is not cashmere it would not itch if it were cashmere	0
0	i had to return it immediately when i opened the box on the picture it looks more blue than purple	0
0	unfortunately the pockets are small the fabric is poor quality the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice overall poor quality i would not recommend these scrubs i personally will never buy from this company again on a more positive note they did get the right size and shipped promptly	0
0	these undies look very cute but they do n't breathe and well let 's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	0
0	look it 's on sale ! usually 800 00 now you can get it for only 150 00 and you wo n't find anyone else wearing this original make your drunken friends dizzy with envy spill anything on this shirt it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill worth every penny as a bonus you can also wear this shirt while hunting	0
0	i purchased this skin to accompany my daughter 's new mp3 player we managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful or so we thought i expected higher durablity	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	had only 4 wks poss washed 2x \( and hung dry \) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me	0
0	the color that i received and the color that was online was not the same i shipped it back had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself tried to resolve through hungry lion but they claimed the color was never shown online when it was hungry lion did say i would get a refund on the item still have not checked to see if i have received credit yet still waiting for my statement	0
0	these slippers are not a bargain they fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again do n't buy 'em they 're junk	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0

0	perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe 's insert but i hated it it felt half there there was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front like those orthotic deals that come on infomercials well it did n't feel good on my tender forefoot so i sent them back on the other hand the shoe looked great i guess if you really want it shoe can go shopping for some dr scholl 's	0

0	i 've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full time in the summer and very little the rest of the year while the shoes are comfortable i was disappointed at how fast they 're falling apart the padding around the ankle has torn there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes and i was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement the solid rubber outsole delivers long wearing durability that 's been my major complaint with these shoes shortly after i got them the soles cracked at the heel and now layers of the soles are peeling off i recommend buying another model	0

0	maybe i'm naive but i never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase they are spring loaded and they turn a certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out i got one out by sheer accident but that is it and there are no directions included so i'm back to a keyring and that 's not so bad	0

0	this suit fits like a true italian size i ordered a 54 which equals a us 44 approximately it fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should even though the body length was normal for a regular i think these suits are defects rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long so i would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves	0

1	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras this one with the center snap closure is the easiest to use it is also the lightest and most comfortable while providing good support my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric even when i try to sew it back into place it breaks loose after a few washes perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine it would last longer this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras \( particularly the leading lady bra which seems to be indestructible \) but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort lightness and ease of use it is by far my favorite	0

1	the shorts were everything i wanted the service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time i bought him all the colours available	0
1	my child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it i allowed it because he has not worn it outside of course he wore it the following day to school rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day very comfortable and cute shoes i might get a pair for myself	0
1	i own 2 pairs they are classy and go with everything but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy but you eventually get the hang of it	0
1	these shoes exceeded my expectations in that they are very lightweight the soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber time will tell how it wears compared to rubber but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair i owned they look good they are very comfortable very little if any break in time if you like the look it 's a safe buy you wo n't be disappointed with the build and feel	0
1	so far i have been very satisfied with this bag for the price i really ca n't complain it has enough different sections places for pens a divider pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use i'm curious about the durability how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last i use it to hold 2 1 notebooks a textbook a portfolio a book a calculator and my pda this is about maximum capacity i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections the handle ontop is cozy the over the shoulder strap should be wider overall i am happy with the purchase and hope that it lasts	0
1	my son used these socks as part of his football uniform he said they were comfortable and i was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week the did n't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks	0
1	this shirt is very cute but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear my child normally wears a 24 month i ordered the size 2 and it 's much tighter and shorter than her other tops	0

1	i am very pleased with these shoes they are very comfortable and look great as well	0
1	the wand is sturdy full sized and nicely designed even if made of plastic the kids wanted their wands so they could play harry potter so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available	0
1	this is cute funny and it 's not uncomforable ! i think it rocks ! i love this movie i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	0
1	the overall quality of the garment is excellent the fabric is of very good quality as is the stitching the sizing is also accurate however the tank top i received was not the one i had ordered but a substitute ! thus four stars not 5 in the future i will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable	0
1	these sox are the best my husband has ever used he has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash he has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w any sox i have found for him until now these make him very happy ! ! thank you	0
1	my husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots i also like the fact you can buy them in black and amazon had a fantastic price on them i do n't know the wearability of the socks since i just got them for my husband for christmas i bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay no holes in the toes yet ! overall i think the socks are great	0
1	these socks are really comfortable and they really stay up ! all other brands of over the calf socks that i have tried wo n't stay over the calf within a few hours other socks are sitting on my shins i have worn pairs of the gold toe over the calf athletic sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch great socks	0

1	this bra fits is comfortable and invisible under t shirts i hope they keep making it forever	0
1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found it very comfortable the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form \( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be \) a little bit faster than some other bras but it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement i just hope they never stop making this bra	0
1	this is a nice case if you are looking for something compact i have a kodak easy share digital camera and it fits perfect inside the case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage	0
1	i purchased 2 other bags before finding this one it is awesome the canon s2 is is a hard camera to find a case for that is n't way too tight or super big i wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it this bag fits it all perfectly ! ! it is n't too small or too big the camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there i would n't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is it is n't big enough for that	0
1	my son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class	0

1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
1	bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions it is stable comfortable provides good traction and is warm without being sweaty i would strongly recommend this boot	0
1	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai	0
1	best sock in performance that i have ever tried i buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed no sagging no defects the only reason i toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use one of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again if they ever stopped making them i would buy a 100 pairs just to know i would have them for my liftime there i actually wrote a review on socks !	0
1	i bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described and to the reviewer who backpacks if your that hardcore of a backpacker you might want to consider spending more than 6 on a fanny pack seriously lighten up and review the product not tell your life story	0
1	this shoe transcended all my expectations the style color and fit were all everything i hoped for and more ! ! ! all this plus a modest price ! !	0
1	this shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt it is unlined has a bit of stretch for comfort and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts i think it runs true to size and matches the color on screen i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt it was almost thirteen dollars then but i have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal	0
1	i have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong i work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether i am on site at home out on the town etc these are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag	0

1	my daughter 's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform i had an awful time searching the net to find any until i came across these they are very soft and comfortable my daughter only wants these types of socks from now on but from a mom 's point of view they are hard to keep white even with soaking in bleach i ca n't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring other than that they 're great	0
1	these socks are wonderful just the right weight very comfortable and warm do n't fade after washing etc etc i purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more	0
1	i purchased these socks from a large department store in chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks i had it took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort i went to amazon and found them in a second i have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks i have in my drawer i am hooked on hue plus size and it is so easy through amazon	0
1	the belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price very satisfied	0
1	i where these shoes all the time they are really comfortable to run in	0
1	i like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean i have a high arch and they seem to support well so i would say over all they were a good choice	0
1	shoe pretty true to size good shoe for the money i buy nike shox often and decided to try these for the price not as cushy as a nike shox but also half the cost or less ! for the price it is a comfy shoe and i would recommend it if you have wider feet and or do n't want to send 90 00 and up for shox	0
1	i 've had foot problems this past year shoes that i had worn comfortably for years including other rockports ecco new balance avia reebock asics etc were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long these rockports are great i'm finally not in a hurry to get home and get into my slides i was to the point that i 'd pay 300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes this shoe is well worth the money	0
1	i highly recomend fruit of the loom mens briefs not only i did grow up wearing their brand but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs if somethings not broke why fix it	0
1	backpack is light when empty yet strong to curry the load of books to school side pocket for bottle very handy top pocket for cd player or small easy to reach items such as keys very helpful and practical i like the base of the backpack being dark color so it does n't look dirty from use	0

1	i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items i ordered as well as receiving a 10 discount coupon for my next order thanks	0

1	i bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend she loves it and has told everyone about it the color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse lunchbag and carryall	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0
1	like wearing a moccasin only with more support more supple than most driving shoes and light weight too soles wear very well as do uppers a great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in southern cal	0
1	so glad i did n't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards it 's been 6 months since i wrote this review and i only become more satisfied with this wallet all my cards are easily accessed viewed and i know immediately if one is missing the leather is silky soft and durable people have been asking where i found this item i think it 's the best i 've ever purchased	0
1	we ordered this case for our son 's creative player and it 's a hit it fits snuggly he can access all the functions with no problems and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and leashes during different activities a great value for the money !	0
1	i just do n't know where to start there just does n't seem to be a way to describe the comfort you will just have to try them on to believe it my neighbor mother husband and i all swear by this product accept no substitutions attractive no but the comfort will blow you away	0
1	these are the best ever ! i bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because i had seen similar 'crocs' at local stores for far less well these are worth every cent ! my daughter and i went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand no comparison ! these are the best	0
1	i wore these shoes when i worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet ankles knees and hips i could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the teeth in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good being diabetic i am very concerned about circulation and i believe this was a good purchase a little expensive but well worth it in the end i plan on buying more	0
1	soo comfortable and soo warm the only thing that sucks about them is that they are n't waterproof	0
1	i bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started let me tell you these boots are great ! ! ! ! ! ! i read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they 're a little big regardless i love them and another thing they keep my feet very warm and cozy	0
1	i read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big so i always wear a eight and i ordered a 9 they were huge on me i sold them to a friend also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot i 'll stick to my ugg 's	0
1	please note i did not find the need to order up many sizes i only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back i loves these boots and at a great price too fast efficent shipping as well i should say that i bought a pair of white mountain suede shearling boots and i was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality	0
1	purchased this for my girlfriend told me that fits well and was very happy with this i am glad to get such a good price on them too	0
1	i have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
1	this is my husband 's favorite shirt because it 's light and comfortable it is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat	0
1	these are the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn they are worth every penny in my opinion they are designed for a man plus they seem to not gather moisture as some fabrics do	0
1	it will definitely get her attention in the best possible way	0
1	this is my first charles by charles david shoe the material is good the size too the only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side but it after 3 days using them it was ok very nice shoe but definetly it is not a 100 dollars one if you pay less than 50 will be fair	0
1	my twin sister bought these for me and initially i thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable breaking them in was n't so hard although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first but now they feel stable comfortable and easy to walk it they feel perfectly balanced and i 've never experiance blisters in these shoes two thumbs up	0
1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0
1	for the price these bags cannot be beat ! there are n't terribly large but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that i purchased for my girls i am having them personalized and they will be ready to give	0
1	i am happy with this bag \( i got the pink and white one \) it is a lovely color nice size durable and good price it comes with an outside pocket and i received it quickly my only complaint is that almost 7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was 3 99 otherwise i highly recommend this bag	0
1	i was n't expecting much based on the price so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my order the tote is a nice size made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well sewn i 've paid a lot more for a lot less this was a great buy	0
1	i have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me once again lifestride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes it fits me very well looks great and is comfortable the color wild rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown i do recommend the shoe and of course it is available in other widths so it is not just for wide feet	0
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn the high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes it 's light weight and flexilble but still supportive well worth 30	0

1	my husband is a big man and very rough on belts most belts last him a few weeks this one has lasted him 3 years the only reason i'm buying him a new one is because he 's lost so much weight there 's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt i'm replacing definitely got our money 's worth out of it	0

1	i bought these just a couple of months ago but i 've already put them to the test i went hiking to a waterfall in mexico i ended up covered in mud my new shoes included i was worried they would be spoiled \( it really was a lot of mud \) then i just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone besides being really comfortable it 's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job	0
1	i love this purse ! i just wish i could get it in the emerald color too i have the magenta	0
1	finally ! i 've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years these enhancers are well shaped and incredibly comfortable when ordering go ahead and get the b c size even if you are an a or low b these inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up i personally recommend using a fashion forms pocket bra style 9400 or a playtex style 4300 order a cup size above what you would normally wear	0
1	for me they are very difficult to put on i have to use a long shoe horn they are n't tight in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm they look great if you like the ugg look i'm hoping when they loosen up they will be easier to put on the top scrunches down when i put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on it could be me though ! otherwise i love everything else about them van c	0
1	this was a very nice item i bought it for my mom for christmas she loved it it was shipped very fast and i was informed very well on shipment information this shoe was a great deal usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal thanks !	0

1	my daughter simply loves this item very handy compact and versatile a great wonderful gift for anyone 's daughter	0
1	these are perfect for low rise pants the cut will likely be flattering for any guy the front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability and i find the fit in the back to be basically great an essential for those whose jeans hang low	0
1	the skin fits well the belt clip works well it seems a bit bulkier than my friend 's zen skin belt clip but she paid about 10 more than i did ! i would definitely recommend this product i have yet to use the armband so i ca n't review that right now my only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin not zen screen so the screen protector is smaller than the zen screen the window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen but that part only tells the time anyway	0
1	excellent product item arrived fast and exactly as described works like a charm have n't yet had tsa open the lock but it does the job	0
1	once my best friend described my bra size as beige meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny 's closet most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly if this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you it looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences the cups do the supporting so the bra does n't need to have those super wide heavily padded straps and it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself	0
1	what can i say these are pretty and practical i know my boyfriend is going to be impressed after the shock wears off i like these panties i like the lacy look so divine and i like the way they ride pretty low and they do n't show through your clothes like my dear gal pal ophella i can imagine a naughty situation or two where i could have a little illicit and harmless fun yikes ! what am i saying	0
1	who has n't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl \? so glamorous girly and sexy i was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot they really do feel like slippers just with the heel as a bonus i normally wear a 6w or a 6 so these are a little snug but not too bad so glad i bought them two pairs red black pink will be next	0

1	they shipped these almost overnight my daughter was a perfect little flower girl no trips no blisters and they 've held up great over the past 9 10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play she was a size 10 at the time of the wedding but the shoes were a 9 \? her feet were fine she can still squeeze into them now and she 's an 11 very pleased good value these are the exact shoes	0
1	now i'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be backpacks i spent about two months searching for a new one until i finally came across this particular model i 'll start with by saying that i love this damn thing it has plenty of space a whole bunch of extra cords that i suppose a hiker would use but i think just look nice and its very durable \( which is a must for me since everything i own will take a beating \) i'm telling you straight from the horse 's mouth this backpack is worth the money now if it only came as an 18 slot	0
1	it is exactly what i was looking for i had no problems ordering or receiving it i got to my house quickly nothing is wrong with it	0
1	the pj bottoms were soft and of good quality material however i ordered the extra large and they were very small for that size it seemed as though the xl was more a med large i would also think that lounge pants or pj bottoms would be a bit bigger as you would n't want these types of pants too tight they were a gift so i just hope they do n't shrink after washing !	0
1	this is such a wonderful pair of gloves they are light and easily portable they can be folded and stored in one 's pockets they have features that enable use of one 's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs the synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather \( especially wind and rain \) i am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone 's elses	0

1	these boots are warm and comfortable like my sheepskin slippers my feet are toasty even when it 's freezing outside they have a thicker sole than some other styles which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice i love the warm brown of the chestnut they look great ! at 50 off the price was great too	0
1	i did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect however the unisex width is way too wide for me i have a pair of ugg men 's ultimate and they are not as wide overall i still think uggs are a little better and more comfortable	0

1	i have to tell anyone who has lower back or foot pain to try a pair of merrells when you try them on they feel comfortable but once you wear them for a week you 'll never wear another brand of footwear \( unless you have to \) most of their shoes need no break in time i own these in four different colors my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these i own more than 20 pairs of merrells i have been wearing these for years the cool thing about them is when you see someone else wearing a pair it 's like you 're both in on a secret you know you 're walking in heaven	0
1	and they are very comfortable quality seems to be better than the last unlisted shoe i purchased elsewhere have n't polished them yet so i ca n't say anything about that	0
1	this merchant really delivers with this item in the stores this is almost twice the price i really was n't expecting such quality from this item \( yes it 's crushed velvet so not warm but warm was n't the goal \) would definitely recommend this item and may buy another color for myself	0

1	i got this shirt when it was on sale for 10 so i snatched it up quickly i like the shirt a lot it is very pretty on order the size that you normally wear i made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a medium the shirt is way to big so maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt	0

1	these are my single favorite pair of underwear not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish i'm in the military so at first i thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these i found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize i wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure there is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy after wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it if you 've never owned a thong i think you should give these a shot i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong	0
1	i just want to make something clear the windbreaker is not prada the tag reads miu miu a very good brand but definetely not prada i found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket i layered it with a black yohi yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect	0

1	for years i wore asics the gt the cumulus the nimbus but i have to say if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds you should try the trigon 4 very similar but cheaper also they did not joke when they called it the ride it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight a big thumbs \( toes \? \) up	0
1	i have had a pair of these for several years they were an incredibly lucky find they 're extremely comfortable better than many pairs of sneakers i 've tried on they 've worn very well and i 'd say they 're well made i 've only had to replace the shoelaces once a bit of polish some kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water and they 're perfect trust me you can walk for miles in them and they look great i think a great purchase if you 're looking for a pair of dress shoes and nervous about buying them without trying them on well my feet love them do n't know how far that will carry yours but there 's my two cents excellent	0

1	these boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest i was pleasantly surprised i was trying to replace a pair i had accidentally washed in the washing machine \( a no no with this fabric \) turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what i had originally purchased i will probably be purchasing more your wife will thank you for buying these excellent quality and softer than satin my only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes because it 's made without a fastener the idea is for a sleeker feel but it sacrifices security love 'em anyway	0
1	this is really a great item very comfortable i would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose great for the intended purpose though	0
1	minimzer is correct i bought this bra in a 38ddd and it made me look more like a d or dd it lifted and minim1zed my breasts my only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point if you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you	0
1	these are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price i wear a large in most shirts and the large size for these fits snug especially after a wash which is how i like it for wearing as an undershirt if you 're buying for outerwear you might consider going a size larger shipping was n't 'amazon quick' but it was reasonable about a week if i remember right	0

1	although i prefer jockey these hanes bikini briefs are great and i plan to order more great value i also bought fruit of the loom but in my opinion the hanes have a much nicer fuller cut the fruit of the loom are for youngsters with tiny butts the reason i did n't buy jockey is they 're too expensive	0

1	i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it i loved the size not to big and not too small and also the flatness of it it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body the strap tends to rub at the neck so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes overall it was pretty good though	0
1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

1	these boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts because they are real leather i was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable but it only took a few wearings before i could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet did n't have any problem with them fitting my calves i had that problem with other boots i have tried before even if you do n't consider the great price for all leather boots they are wonderful buy	0

1	i really like the speedo suit i wear two swim suits the speedo and a larger drag suit over it i 've done this since my days on the swim team the chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time causing the drag suit to self destruct eventually having the speedo prevents any embarrassing moments the fit and material is good and it holds up very well this is the first replacement i 've needed in years if you are husky this might be a tight fit i wear a 42 44 pant size and this is on the snug side	0
1	well constructed blazer great color you can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church	0

1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	0

1	these are the only semi affordable bikini briefs i 've found that are actually designed with a pouch making them the most comfortable on the market \( of all the brands i 've tried that is \) unfortunately they 're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets and you 'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges but what can i say i guess it 's worth it the briefs also run about a size small i have a 31 waist but the mediums are too small	0

1	this is a great pair of shoes and a good to have n your collection it is a subtle silver and looks absolutely delicate on your feet but it is one size smaller than normal i usually wear a 8 5m and this turned out to be small for me i do fit into it but my toe juts out a little bit a 9m would have been better but i dont have the patience to return it so i am gonna keep it its a lovely pair of shoes	0

1	i bought two of these as a gift for my husband he 'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed these were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the 3 4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from the cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged a breeze to organize his vast tie collection and he 's loving this product	0
1	the shoes are awesome my daughter loves them ! business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction	0
1	i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding tip make sure you wash them before you wear them i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability comfort and or needing a professional look in the garments they wear note if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route these do not have any extra pockets	0

1	this case is so cute and matches my green ipod perfectly i read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the ipod but i have n't had that problem the belt clip works great with this and feels very secure the other review said the cut out for the wheel is off a little and i guess she is right looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel is n't centered but it is completely accesible and i have no trouble using it overall i love this case	0
1	i bought this for my husband and am so impressed nice and thick and incredibly soft and huggable i have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores the attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise sturdy shipping box and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required there was even a hand written thank you note included i am more than satisfied	0
1	the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes it has a nice feel to it the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 cotton cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so	0
1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

1	at first i was bugged by how sticky this was but boy did it work ! they gave me 1 2 ounce tube in the hospital \( and charged me 9 for it but that 's another story ! \) it moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing and does n't bother baby a bit take my advice bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over charged !	0
1	i pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running i not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but i ran two half marathons and the nyc marathon with this exact sneaker when they became worn from the wear and tear \? i bought another pair exact one these sneakers lasted me half a training season plus the marathon not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles i highly recommend them and the color is fun too	0

1	finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating large breasted women is no fun but this dress is pretty good what this will not give you is any kind of coverage if you 're ok with people seeing you with major cleavage then this is fine if not just wear it to bed not in the hospital or as i see some women do out of the house yikes ! i think i 'd be arrested	0

1	i recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended asics shoes to me this is my first pair of running shoes and i am very pleased with it the shoes were very comfortable from the day one one comment that i have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front i have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe i worked out fine for me however because i had purchased 1 2 size longer than what i usually wear overall i am very happy with this pair and would recommend it	0

0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1
0	bought these for my nikon d200 about 3 months ago never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse i 've seen build quality of all the filters is really not very good going to go back to hoya 's which are much better	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
0	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
0	the bag is suppose to hold two cameras i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl	1
0	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	1
0	i paid extra for air next day service item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately item eventually arrived two weeks later i had left for a trip item was eventually sent back to merchant merchant did n't credit me for item returned i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited i wo n't buy from willoughby 's again	1
0	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one do n't think so since i got copy poor customer service all around	1
0	i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price like less the 15 shipped	1
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size it was n't even close no size was given for the lense diameter i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it	1
0	i agree with the previous review the deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out	1
0	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
0	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
0	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
0	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
0	i bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt amazingly i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance \( 8 10 feet \) to be under exposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430ex are better but i cannot recommend this one	1
0	i was expecting much more from this flash i already started looking for the better one if i knew this was a closeout item i 'd never buy it it died on me with no indication sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries save money and buy 5xx series flash	1
0	at 300mm this lens is very soft it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus to do so you need to shoot at about f 11 and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on this is a lens that i have constantly fought with do n't upgrade to the new 70 300 is either as it 's only marginally better buy the 70 200 f 4l it 's a far superior lens	1
0	looks nice unfortunately did not power up the camera so i ca n't say much else going to cost me return shipping at the very least sorry i did n't buy the canon product instead	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	i only wish i could return this camera its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants \( what i do most \) and its manual focus is difficult \( very difficult \) to use my much cheaper and lower resolution old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus in addition photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so called high speed memory card do n't buy this camera	1
0	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter it produces flare in the picture furthermore after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 light loss vs multi coated filters like hoya s hmc or b w mrc filters as for polarizer effect itself i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day \( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	1
0	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
0	the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke the mounting head fell apart from the leg the glue they use is very bad i did n't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords i just fixed it myself	1
0	last march \( 2002 \) i bought this camera and it was wonderful although it was refurbished by canon it worked perfectly i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for refurbished items is less than 6 months	1
0	canon 's 28 135mm with is \( image stabilizer \) is a far better choice for the money	1
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	you got to have extremely steady hand or camera stand to use this camaera during my niece wedding i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy we must have took over couple hundred of pictures however i am very unhappy about the result 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy messy out of focus on the other hand for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand you got a great picture size is good weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size but to some people that 's good quality	1
0	like another reviewer 's my experience has been mixed i use this remote with the d50 sometimes the remote works then it goes on strike then suddenly it works again same distance and angle from the camera i changed the battery same result i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable	1
0	image quality is pathetic it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso \( 80 \) rest assured you will be disappointed i returned mine within a day	1
0	i purchased this set and upon arrival i found the circular polarizer to be defective amazon quickly replaced the set and this polarizer did not work either ! i returned the set as i am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works i 'll pay more and get a quality product from a different maker i will say that amazon is second to nobody for customer service i appreciate that and will continue to be an amazon customer however i ca n't say the same for tiffen	1
0	i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens the solution might be useful the blower is useful the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips but the so called magic cloth is anything but magic it kept leaving lint on my lens	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
0	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
0	yes i have to agree with the previous review it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much and just chalk it up to extra protection but that seems to be all it 's good for	1
0	i bought it for my 18 55 ef s and it looks like it is not very efficient but i guess it is normal for a 18mm \( x 1 6 \) i would have prefered a tulip design like those of sigma	1
0	i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it but i 've been disappointed previous to this i bought the 50mm 1 8 for 70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame i need a wider angle lens and went for this one but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible even at higher f stops i shoot with a 20d the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one the focal range of 28 105 was also very nice but to me the picture quality was not so good	1
0	it takes around 3 4 seconds to take the picture after i click the button ! ! and then another 8 10 seconds just to store that picture on the sd card ! ! so basically i cant take another picture until atleast 10 15 seconds of one picture ! !	1
0	just for the record my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models presently in iraq i do want to have a camera with me but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service sad it looked to be a great camera	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
0	i picked this up with a music order for my 350d big mistake the class came chipped scratched and smuged tiffen filters are of very poor quality do yourself a favor like i did and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe oh 10 dollars more this tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting	1
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	1
0	they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries and works with the 20d 's battery grip but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d 's bg e2 grip it has the product name of cpm e3 just as stated but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and does n't even come close to working with the bg e2	1
0	after just over a year my lens jammed and the display read e18 so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect and a defect that canon refuses to admit try googling canon s500 e18 and you 'll see what i meant do n't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight	1
0	1 year old 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times ! search the net for e18 before you buy !	1
0	after owning three other canon cameras i am through with canon all my other cameras were fine this cameras lcd broke within the first month of normal use never dropped ! all of my other digital cameras held up for years ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times this is a product defect design flaw and canon will not cover it under warranty 150 00 to get it repaired and it will happen again or you may start getting the e18 errors this is a expensive paperweight ! poor design very dissapointed i will never buy another canon product again	1
0	for average people who want a camera that just works and takes good pics you should not buy this i do n't know about the specifics but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months so i do n't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does n't even take a picture it was fine while it worked it ate batteries but the pics were good	1
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used the delay between pictures is incredibly long the lens shutter does n't open properly \( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems	1
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly	1
0	ok maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera both my 30d and rebel xt if i am lucky enough it will fall off get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory	1
0	i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable \( i shoot birds at 700mm \) the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses cameras etc one with one without the extender result the image appeared the same size and the extender slightly blurred the image in other words completely useless	1
0	yes it does provide a bit more eye relief and can make it easier to see the whole frame \( by making it smaller \) but there is a major problem with this the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses	1
0	the 5x7 digital photo frame from pacific digital is very cheaply made the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly	1
0	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
0	this filter is fine for normal shooting but if you do low light work beware you will see bad internal reflections on night shots and will need to remove the filter	1
0	i bought this camera in february and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died i could review the photos i had taken but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd efv and only turned off when i removed batteries i sent it to fuji repair center and got it back again almost one month later then six months later the camera did exactly same thing i have n't received my camera back yet but i'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls	1
0	very disappointed by canon on the fit of this adapter adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view andcreate flash shadows	1
0	gosh i would really like to review this adapter but amazon has put my order on indefinate hold as thier supplier is unable to get any more but wait ! what 's that blurb on the product page availability ususally ships within 24 hours and want it delivered tomorrow \? order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes and choose one day shipping at checkout see details so they ca n't deliver it yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow \? do n't order from amazon	1
0	there 's little more to say great item almost a must have but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal	1

0	i agree with m arse with the 2star rating i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers i 've read that it has much better shutter speed recommended \? \?	1
0	hello all lens hoods are pretty much a necessity but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used unlike other hoods that screw on this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one and release the clips this leads to problems of alignment meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right although it 's a pain and i hate i do n't really have another alternative either go w o a hood or take this one either way guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one	1
0	wow now if you really want to see a rip off here it is not to be damaging to amazon com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun the hood is definitely not worth it	1
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs this hood how can you pay 75 for a great prime lens and 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
0	boy this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens it 's a great a lens but this is hardly worth the price	1
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt there is no clip on the case itself holds only the camera not even space for a spare battery or memory card \( i 've heard the case will darken your camera but i did n't end up using the case \) the neck strap is not useful it 's too long at '34 inches if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it \( the canon camera rocks however	1
0	a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for 400 i 've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10 if you 're going to spend that much on a camera get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with the pictures are better and it offers more mp	1
0	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
0	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
0	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
0	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
0	i was expecting much more from this flash i already started looking for the better one if i knew this was a closeout item i 'd never buy it it died on me with no indication sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries save money and buy 5xx series flash	1
0	at 300mm this lens is very soft it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus to do so you need to shoot at about f 11 and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on this is a lens that i have constantly fought with do n't upgrade to the new 70 300 is either as it 's only marginally better buy the 70 200 f 4l it 's a far superior lens	1
0	looks nice unfortunately did not power up the camera so i ca n't say much else going to cost me return shipping at the very least sorry i did n't buy the canon product instead	1
0	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one do n't think so since i got copy poor customer service all around	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
0	i only wish i could return this camera its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants \( what i do most \) and its manual focus is difficult \( very difficult \) to use my much cheaper and lower resolution old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus in addition photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so called high speed memory card do n't buy this camera	1
0	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter it produces flare in the picture furthermore after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 light loss vs multi coated filters like hoya s hmc or b w mrc filters as for polarizer effect itself i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day \( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	1
0	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
0	i purchased the 75 300mm for a trip to a nascar nextel cup championship in homestead fl i was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning the lens is not very sharp feels very cheap and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light i packed up and returned the lens about an hour after i got off the plane i am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture i suggest you do the same	1
0	the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke the mounting head fell apart from the leg the glue they use is very bad i did n't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords i just fixed it myself	1
0	last march \( 2002 \) i bought this camera and it was wonderful although it was refurbished by canon it worked perfectly i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for refurbished items is less than 6 months	1
0	canon 's 28 135mm with is \( image stabilizer \) is a far better choice for the money	1
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	you got to have extremely steady hand or camera stand to use this camaera during my niece wedding i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy we must have took over couple hundred of pictures however i am very unhappy about the result 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy messy out of focus on the other hand for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand you got a great picture size is good weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size but to some people that 's good quality	1
0	i bought this battery as a replacement for an old canon bp511a it lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge complete waste of money	1
0	the filters that i got are poorly finished the 812 filter has a smudge on it while all 3 filters do n't screw on properly on my lens all filters come off easily they are totally useless i suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens	1
0	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
0	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	1
0	image quality is pathetic it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso \( 80 \) rest assured you will be disappointed i returned mine within a day	1
0	i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price like less the 15 shipped	1
0	i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens the solution might be useful the blower is useful the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips but the so called magic cloth is anything but magic it kept leaving lint on my lens	1
0	someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size well that person is n't alone the camera i purchased is a canon s2is which i love the lense does n't fit it i even bought the hood lense adapter set and it still does n't fit this simply is not the right lense for a canon s2is no matter what amazon suggests now too much time has passed for me to return the lense i'm stuck with it and i do n't like that	1
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
0	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1

0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1

0	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
0	i found the product to be made very poorly all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too not a kid friendly camera at all	1
0	this camera is garbage it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money it was hard to figure out it took lousy pictures it burned through batteries avoid this camera i just wish i could give it zero stars	1
0	got this from toys r us for 35 dollars it stopped working within a week if there was a rating less than one star i 'd give it that they should call it dummy buyer you 've been conned camera ki	1
0	i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures i did n't want to spend a lot of money however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working however when it did work every single picture was blurry there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing i would n't recommend this product to anyone it is being returned	1
0	this camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work it 's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures when you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible we trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing	1
0	i had just recently bought this camera and it was ok the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok i couldnt really understand it and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid cd that comes with it and now i cant install it overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of junk now im begging my parent to buy me a reall digital camera ! ! not a peice of crap	1

0	this one is a product of bad quality the cap of the batteries to a few days i damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear product of bad quality i do not recommend it to him \( you them \) and for quality the price must be low	1
0	well at least some stuff is cool free cam bag the pics come out excellent the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to freeze up bottom line i recommend at least researching other brands of mini tapeless cams but this one isnt worth 159 or whatever its trash go for something else	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1

0	in an email adorama specified that the filter diameter was 28mm on the amazon com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 of the purchase price an amount i feel is beyond absurd i can buy this locally for a lot less \( even though i would have to pay sales tax \) buyer beware	1
0	it worked fine the first week then the focus stopped working i sent it to repair it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working i sent it for repair for the second time it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working also it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony ! ! ! they make you wait over an hour ! ! ! si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for ! ! ! sony repair reference number e3317596	1
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless should have sent it back	1
0	i was super excited to get this camera and very disappointed with it once i did the pictures are blurry far more often than not even when resting the camera on a table or solid object additionally it 's so slow at taking them that any movement \( eyes blinking etc \) likes like a massive blur and the video skips all the time it just misses entire parts i would highly recommend not getting this camera	1

0	this canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out on a 1080p monitor i have used other hdv format cameras and they were much better the low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain if you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light but still plauged in low light	1

0	i bought this camera in oct 2005 i brought it everywhere loved it in april 2006 the lcd screen blew canon replaced it with a refurbished camera in march 2007 the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for 97 00 as they have determined this is the result of impact damage how they determine this is unclear to me as it was not dropped or impacted apparently you will spend 100 00 yr maintaining this camera that to me is the hallmark of a faulty product unfortunate as i really loved this camera	1
0	i had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke i do n't know why it broke i set it down and when i turned it back on it had cracked i then bought another lcd screen and repaired it myself but two weeks later i had a case for it and put it in my purse i carried my purse around and had not set my purse down when i took it out it had cracked again i would not recommend getting this camera	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars so i ordered it when i got it its like um is that it \? \? \? it 's really cute and really well made but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards also there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it also the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all other than that it 's cute but not the best out there	1
0	probably would buy other camera if i could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash it is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures you have to learn how to be very steady with it	1
0	i purchased this camera right before we had our first child needless to say i would have rather donated the money to charity ! the flash recovery time is ridiculously slow but that i can live with the 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry i can not now i have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on needless to say i think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera	1
0	last year i purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my nikon 2100 i am extremely upset over this purchase i have made since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures the nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside the indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint and does not focus well however the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp i tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures the outdoor video works well on this camera too i am giving this low one star rating since many events tend to be held indoors this was definitely my final nikon purchase ever	1
0	i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds during this time the camera 's view finder goes black and you cannot use it because the camera is so slow we have missed many important pictures of our children consequently we found that for any important family events this is not the camera we use i own nikon 35mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product if it is your life your recording i recommend that you buy a different camera	1
0	unless you take picture outside no matter what you do the picture comes out blurry flash does n't help at all it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors my sister had a camera from olympus with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too but i found it so much easier to take a picture \( and a better one too \) with that one unless you want to buy your 5th grader his her toy camera you should n't consider nikon 5600	1
0	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
0	if you got here looking for a bag for an xacti camera keep looking this bag is too small it can be used for holding memoery cards and batteries but not much more	1
0	i purchased this along with a sony dcrhc21 this carry case was listed as an accesory so i expected it to be appropriately sized \( as other sony cases i 've purchased fit like a glove \) this case is entirely too large to hold a minidv camcorder the camcorder rattles around inside it if you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one otherwise i suggest you look at the product specifications note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder 's size	1
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	1
0	why do you need a water house for a camera that is 10m water proof	1
0	i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera from the padded case it 's always in and to my horror the e18 error message appeared ! it has n't worked since i paid 400 for this camera and canon would like 110 \( plus taxes \) to fix the problem ridiculous especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras i 've enjoyed the camera 's picture quality and ease of use but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years ! beware of this flaw that canon does n't seem to acknowledge	1

0	not impressed at all with this product you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved i suggest you do n't use easyshare software windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows	1
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them	1

0	but the stitching was irregular on the front i thought the company produced good products but i was mistaken when i bought this item next time i 'll just go to bestbuy for a camera case	1
0	probably a very good case but not a very operatable one in the field you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment a strap and a velcro the shoulder strap is not detachable looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap for the olympus stylus digital cameras look to the lowepro case better case and value	1
0	i will keep this review simple for the price this is an ok deal however the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop the battery charger is finicky and has below average build qualitybatteries are generic rechargeables you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger batteries it will wind up costing you less in the long run	1
0	if you can actually get the picture to turn out right it does take pretty decent pictures most of the time the photo is either over exposed or too dark and grainy it also only holds about 5 pictures so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars and it does n't really seem worth it	1
0	have had an olympus 4 0m for 4 years and been very happy with it as a gift i got this canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness shot about 600 pictures people were blurred not crisp and dim even on a sunny day had to return it do n't bu	1
0	i purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera it 's either not enough or it 's too much i'm not sure which i returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel powershot a640 which has a swiveling view finder \( which is great ! \) and will suit my needs just fine for about 200 less	1

0	i ca n't speak to how well the product performs because mine was doa customer service was unable to do anything over the phone since it was purchased as a gift and i had time before christmas i opted for a different brand does n't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box	1
0	i was very excited to see this frame and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek i was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago the resolution was similar to my first palm pilot \( iiix \) just enlarged i sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces i believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better	1
0	they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill the batteries charged lasted atleast five hours so no complaints there but the charger would keep coming out from the wall it only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it would n't stay all the way in i tried several outlets finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all	1
0	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player when i first received the kit i charged all of the batteries upon first use i only got 7min out of each battery when i got 20 hrs from the batter sent with the player i learned online that the batteries still have their charge but due to the battery 's memory effect or voltage depression my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much juice is left in a battery do not buy this kit	1
0	poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out	1
0	i wish that i could review how well this charger works but unfortunately i ca n't the reason is because it was dead on arrival i essentially bought a 20 00 \( with eek technology 's outrageous shipping \) brick it never worked ever and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit ! at least i have the 4 batteries it came with so it is n't a total loss do n't make the same mistake steer clear of this piece of junk	1

0	the wifi is a great idea ! the idea on paper sounds amazing but the way you had to do it was horrible it gave you no control over what pictures or anything plus it was slow the picture quality was horrilbe ! ! ! m y two megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera they look amazing on the lcd screen but once you get them on the computer they are fuzzy grainy etc i would not recomend this camera to anybody yes it has some nice features but the pictures are anything but acceptable	1

0	very slow storage even with a fast card small but too thick for comfortable handling i ended up selling it on ebay and buying a canon sd600 which is a great camera thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time i 've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures do n't buy the nikon without first checking out the canon sd600	1
0	i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc they let me down as well when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit this will come back and bite them in the behind	1
0	this camera was great at first and very easy to use however the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well when we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture so we put it in our cedar chest \( we keep our house very dry and do n't live in a humid area nebraska \) this worked for a few months but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless i wish it was different but bottom line this is a disposable video camera a nice one but still disposable	1

0	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
0	i had an s5000 but it dropped it and broke so i decided to buy this model since i loved the s5000 so much they took away so many of the great options and quality that the s5000 had so now i just use a small fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf it is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control i would suggest going with the s5000 even with lower megapixels it is much better quality	1

0	i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame i loved it the display contrast and brightness were great however after 5 short months the display 's pixels started acting funny they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it 's back to bad pixels myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue in conclusion it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons	1
0	i bought three of these one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents two of them stopped working one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped unfortunately out of the warranty period ! and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored i'm out a lot of money for this garbage do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! ! !	1
0	received as a christmas present dead by february 24 well actually that 's two months now all it does is flash an error message and nothing i do gets it out of that mode i liked it before it died on me	1
0	i purchased this product about 2 months ago the resolution is not the best but it 's acceptable after a month it turned off by itself and would n't turn on again ! ! i sent it to repair and had to pay 50 00 ! ! ! somenthing to do with the power button i have it on a ups with battery also freezes for no reason i do n't recomend it	1
0	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son i was surprised at how well cheap it appeared we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first then it worked for about 10 minutes then it never worked again and we had to return it amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly we ended up buying the dgx 5 1 mp from a local store i it 's place it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth not a professional photography instrument but a pretty decent unit for him	1
0	i got it on sale for 88 00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price i feel i was ripped off the video quality is ghastly when given enough light and absolutely unusable without the same goes for the pictures even at highest quality and a lot of image enhancements the results are mediocre the audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum which i was able to remove with my audio editing software otherwise the audio recording and playback were acceptable at best this device is useful only as an audio recorder mp3 player and is not really a bargain	1
0	we have had this camera for about a year we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone	1
0	this camera is a piece of junk you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out not to mention the battery life is horrible i got a 1 gb memory card so i could take lots of pictures but the battery runs out after i took about 10 so all in all if you 're considering buying this thing save the money and frustration and just do n't	1
0	the picture quality is okay but the battery life is horrible	1
0	do not buy this camera i repeat do not buy this camera ! just read the reviews and you 'll know exactly what i mean lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas so i did n't spend a dime on it i opened the package before reading any reviews now i wish i 've read the reviews before opening the box i do n't care what setting you use i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera the lighting sucks you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones i really wanted this camera to work it looks sweet but sadly it ca n't take pictures	1

0	i bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars i have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit the set i received did not have the extention straps included the harness was the same as all the other harnesses i could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back if you are buying these because of the extention straps you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars they were well made just not the same item as shown in the picture	1
0	this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars ! the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars other than that the harness is a well made quality product	1
0	i have had several people take my pictures at first everything is fine the pictures are ok the next day my face looks like a pile of baby vomit it is soooo blury then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury i tried fixing it online \( like on the program for the camera \) and it would not work i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks it lasts maybe 3 1 2 hours this camera should be 99 00 trust me people if i could rate this thing at a zero i would it is not worth it however a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5 an awesome little camera	1
0	it 's not an item to write home about final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular the wi fi works some days mostly not if i 'd known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser	1
0	i 've owned this camera a little over a year it was my 2nd digital camera it always had focus issues in low light i thought it was me but after working extensively with the manual after i finally had some time i discovered that it was the camera you really need a tripod for those low light shots i was n't able to return it so i 've taken hundreds of pictures with it it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen however the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least 170 i'm just going to get a better quality camera i will not buy sony again	1
0	this tripod seemed to be very nice until we tried to extend the legs all of the way two and a half of the legs worked well the third had a section that would not stay extended the locking devices are pretty poor they are made of a cheap plastic and i believe that even the ones that do work well now will not last very long with even moderate use next time i will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock	1
0	very disappointed in this product and amazon 's response to the problem item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed they have told me they ca n't supply the missing part \( the metal neck strap showing in the photo \) as item comes from a freight forwarder i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country	1
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging how to i recharge it \? nothing tells me how to recharge it so far money wasted unresponsive to my emails	1
0	it got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it \( a month or so later \) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly a huge disappointment and waste of my money	1
0	the main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away the quality is very poor the unit is very bulky to carry around your neck the sd card slot has some block in it i was not able to even insert an sd card all in all not satisfied at all	1
0	the camera is just plain cheap takes nothing but fuzzy low resolution pictures the thing weighs a ton and even for all that the binoculars are only mediocre a great idea maybe someday someone will actually do it right	1
0	this is a terrible product 1 the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use 2 the pictures are extremely poor 3 the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient w	1
0	i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1 3mp digital camera binocular the first one had software hardware that hung up after 3 pictures the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box a truely tatty product	1
0	this battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my philips pet724 7 portable dvd divx player after that it claims to have 75 charge left but ca n't even get the player to turn on and does n't charge it if it 's turned off	1
0	the battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge i made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband 's dvd player and they were useless what a waste of my money	1
0	i only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so i returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7 hours of run time per charge	1
0	fuji fails to honor warrantee do n't buy from themdo not buy the fuji digital camera they charged me for a fix within the warrantee period their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee	1
0	the title says it all one month the warranty expired the zoom feature on the camera broke making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on the camera is all but useless the fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly at a cost of at least us 120 for that price i'm buying a new camera but not another f10	1
0	in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	1
0	i'm going to be completely honest with you i hated the hp camera 's because 1 does not take great pictures at night 2 digital zoom is not great either 3 blur 's out if you do not stand still taking the picture i 've had an old hp camera and i have had this newer hp camera and they are all the same it doesnt seem like it really matters what mp they are still bur 's out and it is disappointing i guess it really depends on the person about this camera but i 'd rather have a sony samsung or some other company 's item	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	this camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures i bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it \( she 's happy with anything pink \) i was very disappointed at the quality and functionality	1
0	i was extremely disappointed with this product i felt very let down by sony because for years i bought sony items with confidence knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable this item only goes to prove that sony 's standards have dropped and as such i will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs what lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up 2 metres \( not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping \) was the best i could do and that was in a straight line no all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin	1
0	crap does n't work wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period plastic junk never did get a good signal the worst sony item i 've ever purchased and i'm a sony fan will still attempt to return somehow do n't even bother	1
0	i have an r717 camera i bought the dock too each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera i bought a clone battery \( not hp \) and its edges are rounded too maybe hp could explain the difference just thought you would like to know	1
0	the article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears the conector to the camera is not usb fire wire but it is a type nini stereo	1

0	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
0	have had it for a few weeks and glad i brought it great procuc	1
0	these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them which misleads one to think they are good quality i bought them for my son and by the time i got around to sending them i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in so the lens was misaligned it was past the 30 day return date so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use they are still not right but i keep them in my car for occasional use my advice spend some extra money and get a good pair	1
0	nice look good feel turns on fast takes great pictures really great with ridiculous depth of field and resolution you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back which is huge so what 's my beef \? slow pictures double flash slow slow follow on shot slow okay say cheese one second two seconds i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved yes my battery is charged no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye \? slow i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still its awsome slick and a fair price	1
0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	1
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it the quality of the pictures is very poor showing large grain even at shq and low iso settings no combination of settings seems to improve quality	1
0	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
0	this was a terrible purchase on my part it does n't even deserve 1 star i just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky the bag was too small for my z7590 and i paid 8 shipping plus return shipping i only hope they do n't charge me a re stocking fee i went to walmart found a cute little bag in the electronics dept that the camera fits great in with room for the strap and extra memory cards or battery if necessary they have cute ones for ladies too with pink polka dots or stripes inside ! for only 12 next time i 'll be smarter !	1
0	i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself the pictures are clear and crisp if i had to buy another i would purchase the same	1
0	loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it two years later my feelings are very different batteries need to be recharged constantly camera rarely turns on after being off it 's dock for more than an hour all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying zoom is worthless pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated flash is also way too bright half of my pictures are annoyingly white looking because of this definitely going with canon on my next purchase	1
0	like others mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in i turn it on in still mode bought in december 2005 it is now not working it is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and sony is not addressing it sony should be forced to recall these cameras	1
0	the cybershot dscs40 was bought as a christmas gift for my daughter in 2005 a few days after christmas 2006 the camera ceased functioning because the camera was shipped in november 2005 sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as 111 needless to say we will not be purchasing another sony product in the future	1
0	i loved my 4 1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005 then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it if i would tap the camera they would go away but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working it would turn on but then shut off i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did n't work it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use so sad camera dea	1
0	as the previous reviewer pointed out this is not the klic 5001 1700 mah battery as described in the product details it is the lower capacity \( 1050 mah \) klic 5000 at least it is the kodak battery if that matters to you \( i have a new kodak camera and want to protect the warranty \) if not plenty of places sell the generic klic 5001 for less than amazon sells the kodak klic 5000	1
0	the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time an number or not the same an it s not the same battery do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling	1
0	i ended up not purchasing this rechargeable battery and charger kit from amazon because i had waited for it for about 5 weeks and gave up then i discovered that i could buy a similar product at staples and cheaper too ! i do n't think amazon is the place to go for electronic products	1
0	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels i would not recommend this item at all	1
0	ordered two frames from the third party source neither on of them worked at all it has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund	1
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price \( if you get a good deal \) photo quality is poor and screen is quite small \( 3x5 \) navigation is not overly complicated but buttons must be pushed hard to work it did work perfectly fine took sd card even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame but because of the poor quality of the photos i do n't suggest buying	1
0	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1
0	if you lose this cord just get a flash card reader it 's cheaper and more practical	1
0	the case is very big why buy a small camera and end up with a big case the case looks nothing like the picture the picture is of another case	1
0	these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them which misleads one to think they are good quality i bought them for my son and by the time i got around to sending them i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in so the lens was misaligned it was past the 30 day return date so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use they are still not right but i keep them in my car for occasional use my advice spend some extra money and get a good pair	1
0	very easy to set up but no matter what i did i got several horizontal interference bars one very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older tvs using a coax cable instead of rca i am returning this product	1
0	i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case	1
0	nice looking good quality but the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out	1
0	the case fits like a tight glove i do n't like that the camera was hard to get in and out and did n't have any pockets for straps or batteries	1
0	nothing special and probably over priced for what it is the leather is nigh on invisible it 's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches case would be stretching the definition somewhat	1
0	cheaply made and ill fitting this deluxe case is n't worth half the price there is no handle or wrist strap provided your camera 's strap becomes the carry handle a small snap strap is provided but i ca n't figure out what it 's for the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure and i would n't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case much less with the heft of a camera inside do n't buy this item amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage because it 's not their fault you do n't like it and you will be returning it save yourself the trouble	1
0	this product is worthless you 'd be better off keeping your money and buying a good case at a store overpriced cheap plastic y rip off no deluxe here	1
0	the default supplier for this item is adorama they have sku numbers mixed up on the back end so they will ship you the hp 6221 dock instead will not work with the r series they do not even carry the actual hp 8887 dock huge hassles so click on the new and used link and buy directly from amazon it 's a few dollars more but at least you get the right item	1
0	this dock does not fit the r817 camera just bought this and the hp r817 and i am very disappointed the input for the camera is to big for the 817 so do not buy this if you get the 817 update this review was written when the dock was stated to fit the r817 which has been changed because it does not fit	1
0	my boyfriend bought this for me not realizing that my camera came with a case \( i have the sd200 \) this case is n't a good fit for the camera and i 've never used it because of that	1
0	i ordered the camera case for the canon digital elph 450 and i was given a completely different one prices sound great but they do not deliver what you buy had a bad experience with them	1
0	dont bother upgrading your power shot camera just buy a better one the zoom lens ads a whole 5 ft to the view before the pixels become a big issue	1
0	this is first canon product that has disappointed me with its quality they must acquire them from their chinese supplier for about 98 cents this plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position i bought it to use with the canon 250d close up lens and it 's barely adequate for that function canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks	1
0	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1
0	i 've had other digital cameras but this is the first one i 've had problems with i started getting a zoom lens error shortly after i bought it but it would clear if i turned it off then back on it is now unusable as the lens can not be retracted at all it lasted 18 months	1
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	another lense jam problem the lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket and the lense extended and jammed this happened frequently with my old powershot s30 but never caused a problem canon said the warranty is void because there 's a tiny dent on the front and back they said any physical damage voids the warranty i complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily they gave me 20 off the repair	1
0	bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error \( appears like the shutter never opens \) and will not record video spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in will update my rating after i see what is wrong if they can fix it if they will stand behind their product watch for more details before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price	1
0	i bought a jvc mini dv just over a year ago it now does not work of course the warranty has now expired and i am out of luck spent 400 on this model i do not recommend jvc	1
0	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy unfortunately the images appeared for one day and then the unit stopped working we had to send the unit back i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item	1
0	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months i 've called digital spectrum sent faxes and emailed them this has been going on for nearly a month a real waste of money my time	1
0	far better models for similair price range dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc works fine though	1
0	the plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately also be sure to note that there is no memory card spend the extra money and buy something better i wish i had	1
0	i bought this for my wife and she loved it but it broke after the amazon return policy was up i contacted the company by email twice and have not heard from them	1
0	i purchased this to display mpeg movies \( which it says it can \) i was told by tech support that i had to use a divx encoder and that they must be avi \( which is also incorrect \) the sanyo xacti video camera i was using was mpeg 4 \( the ipod accepts the files without issue \) i tried converting them in quicktime to several different types of mpeg4 and none worked there are better frames out there and i intend on finding out which one is the best i have ordered another brand and will see if it works this was by first product return on amazon	1
0	have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid instructions worthless only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error after getting best possible settings main problem is still picture quality using high quality jpg files as input photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies individual dots very noticeable even at some distance not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames just arrived from amazon and intended as a v day gift \( tomorrow \) for my wife big disappointment guess i better make a dash to the florist	1
0	this frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter the idea was great but the frame was n't it was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand she sent it back and bought one she loves from sam 's warehouse	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on and in good lighting it is barely adequate wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer you get what you pay for	1
0	do n't let the product description fool you into thinking it will work with a zr85mc camcorder it did n't work with mine it did n't even fit	1
0	i ordered the original item used it for about a week then sent it to my son in new hampshire he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up never to function properly again i ordered a replacement checked it out and sent it on to him with the same result less than 15 minutes of use it quit working i thought the unit was nice compact and fairly easy to use but with two malfunctions in two cameras i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone	1
0	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont then after a week it just stops working dont get it theres no flash whatsoeve	1
0	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera the battery is dead i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day i should expect very much i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes but i should n't have to do so	1
0	this camera took some great pictures and i enjoyed it 's size and functionality for several months i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass the end the lens assembly is shot according to my local camera store not economical to fix this was about the softest fall a camera could take and not work it was like landing on a pillow i will not buy hp cameras again	1
0	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
0	thought i 'd died and gone to heaven this lens was everything i wanted and more three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus now it does a focus dance clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus it 's not my d70 which still works wth other lenses this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it i 'll revise this review	1
0	not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly it is a complete downgrade panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the pv gs320 model a microphone jack ! i currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time since the 300 is discontinued i purchased the so called upgraded model now the only available model with mic jack is the vdr 310 and i have heard dvd is quality on camcorders is not what it should be if you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a mic this camera is not for you	1
0	this product link needs to be corrected as the battery contained in the kit is not the same battery which is used in the dcr dvd7 do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the dcr dvd7 camera	1
0	the only reason i am giving this 1 start is becuase of amazon 's poor service otherwise i would give 5 stars for the product i placed this order more than 30 days ago amazon still has not shipped the item so i cancelled my order and placed it with j r if amazon did not have the item in stock they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in shipping	1
0	i paid 99 00 for this little camcorder thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc the menu button would not bring anything up so overall we just could n't get this thing to work a bummer of a christmas present	1
0	i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it therefore my family bought me this sony for my b day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned if you have any movement \( such as action shots or small children \) the picture always comes out blurry what a pain ! also the picture quality is horrible i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak	1
0	bought the samsung 363 from amazon and it developed mechanical fault while i was test running making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable about 2 weeks later i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again problem with the power system paralysing it completely \( all in less than 3 wks from purchase left it plugged to charge for 2 days without differenceit 's indeed a sad story that would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder	1
0	i bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the pc it worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the lcd or the viewfinder i could see other information on the lcd such as the date time menu but no image from the screen i called samsung and that is where it is now for repairs a check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented i did try to install the software that came with the camera but that did not go to well either i will retry when i get a working camera again	1
0	this needs a lot of light i returned this do due the lighting picture quality the one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card mpeg 4	1
0	the thing is that it is not a very stable camera hence it does not give you very stable shots so many of your pics will be blured even those taken with a tripod i am a pro photographer and i would not recommend this camera yes it 's very thin but is not worth the pics it takes seek for other model not so tiny if you 're expecting better images	1
0	we bought this camera two years ago we have loved using it until last week the camera showed an e18 error in the middle of a special event we researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on we 're not sure how ours developed the e18 \( never dropped or damaged \) our camera has been rendered useless and canon 's only response it to have us mail it in for 100 repair	1
0	please buy a different camera i have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras under normal wear and tear the cannon sd400 's lcd screen broke where other cameras i 've owned have not i just purchased the nikon s7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that i can hit it with no adverse affect if you do buy the sd400 set aside the 150 you 'll likely need to replace the lcd	1
0	i got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message i now find out that was a design flaw anyway i spent hundreds of dollars on this one and now just over a year after i got it it wo n't hold a battery charge i loved both cameras while they worked but i ca n't afford a 400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so i 've written to canon tech support unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge i'm moving on to another brand camera	1
0	i bought this camera to mainly use the digital macro mode it worked great for several months now it will not lock focus this camera is very frustrating every picture that i take i have to edit to lighten the picture i tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out to no avail i am a commercial real estate appraiser so i have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera and just about every one i had to lighten now the macro mode wont work i will not buy another cannon product ever again ! !	1
0	add another e18 error code complaint to the list ! i purchased the camera about a year ago and have had the e18 error for about the last 2 months the camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all just beep at you and give you an error code e18 i 've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots canon wants nothing to do with the fix and estimates repairs between 150 and 200 save the headaches and buy another camera from a different manufacturer !	1
0	here 's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired the camera is only about 2 years old guess i 'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits ! the camera really performed nicely when it was working thus the 2 stars hope you have better luck than me if you get one	1
0	i got the dreaded e18 error after owning this \( naturally \) for just over a year repairs will be at least 100 and repairs are only guaranteed for 90 days even if the exact same problem occurs again ! this is clearly a design flaw \( just read how many users had the same problem \) my first photoshot broke after about a year and a half and since i liked the ease of use and basic design i chalked it up to bad luck and bought another big mistake	1
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned i'm not exaggerating i'm so upset for wasting money on it the only pictures that turn out are outside in bright daylight it takes horrible pictures in low light there 's a high level of noise in the photos the video mode moves in and out on its own ruining the video i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos my friend 's 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing it just plain sucks	1
0	junk you will get a lens cap error in about a year or so where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore	1
0	i thought my jvc digital camera was handy easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was then one day at my daughter 's ballet show i turned it on \( i made sure i charged it all night \) and it would n't record it kept saying that the lens cap was on i am so frustrated and sad i spent a good chunk of money on this item and do n't know what happened still do n't have a way of recording my daughter 's milestones do n't buy it if you have other options	1
0	the main reason i ordered this kit was for the battery when i received it no battery included i contacted amazon and all they could do was give me a number for sony customer service thanks amazon ! !	1
0	bought the camera charger and the kit as part of the deal every thing looks good except the missing npf 50 battery requested for a replacement in the replacement kit also battery was missing returned both the items 59 99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item	1
0	return \? ha ha ! ! ! you must email them for permission they do n't provide the email address i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond they will do everything to avoid returns and amazon just looks the other way do n't do it !	1
0	after about 2 months of light use the camera stopped working also the output format was very difficult to work with absolutely will not work on a mac the price is coming down greatly i saw it for 88 at target	1
0	the is dv only records videos in the 'asf' format not mpeg 4 i bought one from 'egghead com' after 30 days i contacted aiptek to tell them the problem they acknowledged that the is dv only records videos in the 'asf' format they said there is nothing they will do about it do not buy this product aiptek advertises that the is dv records video in mpeg 4 format but it does n't 'egghead com' wo n't deal with me because they say i should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date	1
0	unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10 4 program \( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac	1
0	the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture compared to other digital camera 's this has presented a problem for the two users i purchased these camera 's for also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet the pictures are too hot over exposed and no adjustment works properly	1
0	what a pile of junk three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture if you move at all during that three seconds the picture is a blurred mess even if you do n't move the pictures turn out blurry and dark and if you use the flash you get a lovely white picture of nothing i ca n't believe they sell this thing	1
0	i got for christmas it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on stay away from this one !	1
0	i was happy at first when i got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out i was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when i tried re formatting the card my phone computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so i ended up throwing it away i guess you really get what you pay for	1
0	sd card worked fine for a week problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just does n't work anymore problem is not the pda nor software on it tried to use the card on a separate flash reader writer tried formatting it to fat32 create test directory data stays on for less than one hour i would refrain from buying this product	1
0	i 've never ordered anything and been this disappointed i ordered two of these and both did n't work i contacted the company 's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support i will never buy another product from this company again	1
0	the battery does not hold up after 10 months it would not work at all i thought it was the battery emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable i found one and changed it out myself the unit was just dead warranty is 60 days will not buy another one	1
0	the idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful i have it have pictures on it but never show it to anyone trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous easier to show a few pictures in my wallet	1
0	i was really disappointed in this product it worked great when i first got it but before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working it was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera like i said disappointed	1
0	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera the picture quality was not good at all i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera it stopped working and i did not use it that much i now own the sony cybershot dsc w50 that takes great pictures i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006	1
0	camera worked great for us for 6 months easy to use decent pictures and good software the battery life was fine for our use it quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless for a six month disposable camera its a little expensive	1
0	this is a complete waste of money \( 1 \) it 's clunky and hard to carry around \( 2 \) not really a good value for money based on the mp 's it offers i would recommend you spend the add'l 50 and get a nicer camera ! this one is crap	1
0	i gave it two stars because it was great when it worked i got it sometime in january and it lasted until about june i take good care of my things so i know its not me it just suddenly stopped working i'm more than just a little miffed i 've tried getting all different types of batteries i 've tried letting it sit for a while i 've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff its dead i just threw it away	1
0	horrible camera barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz drained the batteries within a few pictures so not worth more then the cost of a disposable ! ! sorry kodak but i 'll stick with the good ol' reliable sony	1
0	i have had this camera for about a year and a half i got so fed up with it that i just bought a new one i admit this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom is n't used however this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used i would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera	1
0	amazon replaced the original coolpix p3 because of technical defects but the new one has worst problems this one does not even focuses at all i dont know what to do now because there is no technical service for nikon in my country venezuela or latin america i basicly lost my 300 dollarsplease answe	1
0	the worst thing for this is you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing hd video i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder but a small disc can only hold 20 min hd video have to change disc time by time the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today a lot of noise will come in low light condition ! i bought it for 800 and return it i think you 'd better buy sr1 with a 30g hard drive that would be a much better one !	1
0	this product did n't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit the sound from the ecm hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself i wish i had not bought it	1
0	i agree with the previous reviewer buying attaching and using this microphone is a waste of time and effort save your money and get a good microphone unless you want your sound track to sound like someone mumbling into a tin can	1
0	hi i have had the vdr d300 for about 6 months now i have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min the camcorder constantly locks up usually after about 10 min this is on a full battery the unit never gets even to a battery alarm several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works i must have a faulty unit i'm investigating repair the unit has a great lens camera and video image but my unit is not stable at all	1
0	amazon picture shows an original japanese produced np 40 with 3 7v and 710mah \( just like the one i got with my f810 \) what i got was a fujifilm branded chinese produced np 40 with 3 6v and 750 mah yes it works but it 's just obviously cheaper skepticism is a virtue	1
0	i bought this because it was 50 off i ca n't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer i guess for background noise it would be good but as a photo viewer it 's not small screen low resolution poor viewer	1
0	the product features are ok but the screen is very small also the resolution needs to be better the photos were very grainy an impressive looking product with not so impressive output	1
0	i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however the lens failed in less than one year service took 6 weeks to repair the lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair why is the lens failing to open again \? i absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although i do have a paid plan for it why ca n't warranty be fast local and competent	1
0	i was very disappointed in nikon 's service this camera has a 2in lcd display that apparently is very fragile when i returned for service nikon claimed i dropped it which i did n't ! i was very careful in handling this camera but the fragile lcd still broke to be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing they offered to repair it for 210 nearly the price of a new camera i will never by a nikon product again if they are going to sell such a fragile product they should at least include a hard case for it	1
0	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy unfortunately the images appeared for one day and then the unit stopped working we had to send the unit back i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item	1
0	i won this camera in a contest and now i'm kinda wishing i never had practically everything i 've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another from the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations to the camera recording glitches in the audio when i capture onto my computer i know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right but i really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a canon camera that 's not gonna cause you these problems	1
0	this is the worst camcorder i 've ever owned the picture quality is the worst i ca n't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance if i move a little or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus i have n't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet i recommend panasonic it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear it 's my fault i did n't do my research before i bought this	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box it takes the output of the camcorder \( composite rca or s video \) and compresses that to mpeg 2 \( dvd \) or mpeg 4 \( or divx \) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd \( mpeg 1 or mini dvd \) look for plextor 's m402u box unless you really want to deal with 3 125 mb of data per second \( 25 mbps \) or about 180 mb per minute or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link get the m402u your options will be greatly expanded and you wo n't tell the difference by looking	1
0	i recently ordered a kodak camera from amazon com with that i also ordered this battery the camera bag everything was delivered as expected except the camera over 2 weeks later i was notified the camera is not available now i'm stuck with a battery camera bag that i ca n't return because they came from another seller the camera i bought from a different seller came with the bag uses a different battery now i'm out the cost of the battery the bag the shipping charges ! thanks a lot	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	the power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself you would n't get that from the picture too bad other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger	1
0	the quality of the pictures are nice when they will actually print unless you use the printer with your camera on the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work if you decide to crop the picture on your pc and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work ! i have had it for sometime now and i have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing	1
0	mini dv cams are better and should cost about the same this particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer the software is glitchy so you 'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself find a different camera	1
0	the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	1
0	i was counting on a three hour working battery after all that 's what it says it gives you so far all i get from it after more than a month of use is two hour max	1
0	i made mistake getting such a big bulky case for small minidv sony camcorder hc26 this case can take any big size old camcorders \( like old sony hi8 \) so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice	1
0	got this camera for my wife a digital novice during christmas 2005 camera is easy to use and takes good pictures easily interfaces with pc through usb however i also \( as did another reviewer \) started having problems after about 11 months camera would not take pictures as the ccd went bad luckily i had an extended service contract and it was repaired unfortunately it just quit working again \( april 2007 \) and the service contract company says they wo n't bother fixing it again and is refunding my purchase price gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract	1
0	but it stopped working after a year the only thing the lens sees now is black although the camera still turns on and i can look at pictures i took before the problem started nonetheless i loved this camera and i think it was worth it even though it only worked a year now i 've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera	1
0	great camera for the price but i guess you get what you pay for bad warranty	1
0	after doing a bunch of research i bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective sony ccd that late model 2005 point and shoots all seem to have had the first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations after a few days of that the camera dies completely the second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease one camera a fluke maybe but two \? that suggests a real problem so beware	1
0	dsc series camera all have a ccd imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years \( do a google search you will find out what happened \) sony knew this problem years ago but refuse to fix it they will wait until the camera fail and then charge you 300 to fix it that 's what happens to my dsc f717 ever wondering why dell hp etc all recall sony battery for laptop but sony did not recall their own laptop battery \? sony will never fix their own problem we the customer have to pay for their mistake	1
0	i bought this in august 2005 when the original battery that came with my nikon coolpix 880 \( late 2000 \) started running down fast on the page i ordered from it appeared to be a genuine nikon battery however when i received it it was not it was made in taiwan and does not have the nikon brand name anywhere on the battery \( or packaging as i remember \) this battery has never held a charge well it 's about as bad as the original battery is now and i 've only had it a few months maybe i just got a lemon but i 'd recommend you buy a genuine nikon if you can find one	1
0	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
0	i bougt this camera and a olymus camera both in the same price range the kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship avoid this at all cost the olympus was well made durable higher quality picture and ease of use	1
0	my camera has broken in less than one year of owning it because i received it as a gift i do n't have the proof of purchase so kodak will not fix my camera for no cost what a lemon the cx7300 is first of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture what 's broken \? i can take one picture before the batteries go dead i change the batteries one picture change the batteries again one picture	1
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1

0	i loved this camera when i received it and used it a couple of times then it just stopped working i have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great maybe this was just a bad egg good camera but 2 months of use for the money was n't good	1

0	i thought i was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos i shot indoors i liked the analog better very poor and grainy also the focus is terrible ! while filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus i filmed my daughter 's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing very disappointed with this purchase i guess it 's true what they say you get what you pay for it seems under 600 00 does n't get you much	1
0	i would agree with the other review the indoor low light quality of the video is unacceptable i will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	i agree with the two previous reviewers there needs to be a user manual and there is n't one the fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees this is n't very helpful for star gazing the maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches this is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together	1
0	on reciept of the tripod i found it wrapped and packed \( on the outside \) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product when i opened the box i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box there was minimal packing around the tripod itself mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping also if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company instructions are not part of their package	1
0	i ordered this product from amazon com and when it arrived i fully charged the batteries when i went to use them they were dead i charged them again and when i went to use them a few days later the batteries were dead again ! i want my money back	1
0	i own the olympus fe 100 digital camera and it came with unchargeable batteries \( oxyride \) i switched to energizer batteries and bought an energizer 4 battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas it 's not a quick charger like this one but i say for less than half the investment i 've got a charger that does the job i would not spend this kind of money on a charger so i say if you 're part of the gotta have it now generation you definitely pay for convenience otherwise charge your batteries more slowly \( 2 3 hours \) and save a lot of money	1
0	this thing stinks ! so much digital noise its output is terrible i do n't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so bad do n't be fooled thinking wow 8 megs for a low price i have a 5 meg sony that is many times better all that noise blows the detail out get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures other wise stay away	1
0	i ordered this tripod and it arrived broken the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic i asked for an rma order via e mail and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice 'being lazy about mailing things back and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself where it broke \( the three plastic rings on the camera mount \) it was impossible to re glue because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure even if your tripod arrives un broken it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all	1

0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect forthe dx759	1
0	this kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper unfortunately kodak does n't contain an ink cartridge for them fine i thought i 'll buy a separate cartridge guess what \? you ca n't ! kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges \? seems pretty dirty	1
0	i do n't see how they can recommend this kit for all dx cameras the dx7590 would barely fit in that case	1
0	just returned the mobicam had poor reception even in adjacent room ! smallo screen not stable falls easy seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house !	1
0	very good product very satisfied the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette	1
0	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future the lens adapter by itself does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else \? \? \? ben boykin las cruces nm 8801	1
0	i just got this printer dock with a camera and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried when it does feed it ends up jamming i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	1
0	i recently purchased the g600 printer dock and have n't even gotten to try it out yet the print cartridge that came with it did n't work i ordered another and inserted it and it still does n't work it constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced lots of time and money involved in this mess stick with hp !	1
0	bought this camera for my wife takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution if you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill fuji customer relations is sub par warranty does not cover any impact internal damage i 've had better luck with nikon and kodak and will steer clear of fuji in the future	1
0	i have two 8 picture frames that are other brands and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it	1
0	the battery which popped up with my camera order does not match the camera thus i am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery i was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so i had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived	1
0	product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery as of 1 29 07 it has not been taken off my credit card how would you rate my review	1
0	my frame freezes after displaying a few pictures the remote does n't work there is no website for contact or support	1
0	this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned the manual is worthless and the web site even worse i try to delete the included photos and nothing happens i ca n't download photos from my mac if your digital memory card has many photos good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame	1
0	if you want to load directly from your camera 's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card there is no copy all function loading information from a computer did n't work the usb connection was not recognized by windows xp and i could n't find any drivers on the web a setup cd would be a nice addition btw the screen was not as large as one might think it is very wide but not tall and it crops the top bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people	1
0	i wish there was a space for zero stars we bought this frame for my in laws for christmas and it worked for ten minutes and then died it was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here others have had a problem with it freezing once it does that there 's no fixing it apparently do some research and buy another unit that 's what i'm going to do	1
0	keep in mind that you ca n't use this product unless you buy an external flash the built in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos canon 's responsethank you for your inquiry regarding the powershot g6 we are sorry to hear of any issues with the conversion lens when using the built in flash a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information when the converters are used it is recommended to not use the built in flash thank you for choosing canon	1
0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	1

0	i bought this to play back old hi8 tapes so i could transfer them to dvd however there is no s video out and no stereo out video quality was bad output was noisey and reds were over saturated i imagine this is because there is no s video out i returned it and have ordered a sony gv d200 hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much there are some cheaper used options available e g sony evo 250	1
0	ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality its fuzzy im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back i hope this has helpe	1
0	we ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5 7 hours it stopped working all of the sudden \( no power \) sent it for warranty \( part no labor \) 160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it would not but another camcorder from panasonic \( they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back \)	1
0	one of the most disastrous purchases we 've ever made it works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer do n't bother trying to consult the instruction guide it 's the worst one you 've ever seen you could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need but they 're not actually on the website definitely find another brand	1
0	this camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio however i was unable to make copies for back up or to share with family members i took it back and bought a mini dv camcorder as i was told it was easier to make copies this has yet to be tested	1
0	be warned if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing sharing whatever ca n't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks but could n't find one i searched all over asked in several places on the apple web boards talked to the 'geniuses' at the apple store this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive talk about crazy !	1
0	do n't order this battery unless you have money to throw away ! i ordered one that would not hold a charge called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad now after 3 months it is n't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time ! ! ! this is unacceptable and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product ! avoid at all cost even if that means paying the extra 10 bucks for an original kodak branded battery	1
0	i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more then nothing for the rest of the roll we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it should have bought a disposable one	1
0	i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what	1
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned i'm not exaggerating i'm so upset for wasting money on it the only pictures that turn out are outside in bright daylight it takes horrible pictures in low light there 's a high level of noise in the photos the video mode moves in and out on its own ruining the video i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos my friend 's 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing it just plain sucks	1
0	as i have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus i thought this might be a solution this eyecup fails on all requards worst feature the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless last it has the cheep feel of cracker jack plastic well and the optics to match now i know where olympus had it manufactured	1
0	offers no eye comfort whatsoever magnification is very weak stick to original eye cu	1
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier professional medical photographer	1
0	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets quite small for the price just paying for the name on the bag	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok but why buy this monster for that \? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp ok so maybe video \? ok but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage \? cant edit it without a lot of work \( where is the firewire port or even the ability to edit an mpg file \? \) geeez anyway i am taking mine back it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera save your money dont do it	1
0	this is a nice case however i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends this case is bulky and my panasonic fxo1 would fit into something much smaller i ended up going with a great case that i found at wal mart for a cheeper price sleeker design small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town	1
0	this case looks good and protects the camera adequately but is too bulky it has n't got a lot of room inside i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery the belt clip is difficult to use and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time there are better cases for this camera	1
0	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
0	i found a case that 's almost exactly like this one except it 's 10 cheaper it 's made by samsonite model tm90blu \( there is also a black case \) but like i said exact same thing unless you care about your camera case saying lumix save yourself some dough and get the one from wal mart	1
0	i bought this frame in jan '07 and the screen burned out march '07 i returned it and the newest one burned out last night april '07 this product needs a redesign the screens do n't work for long	1
0	purchased this item in dec 06' screen burned out mar 07' on top of that screen quality was not that great do not order order this item	1
0	nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card \( ms or sd \) it will not operate without it ! on the back of the package it reads download photos with usb cable \( incl \) or simply insert memory card \( ms or sd not incl \) wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device they cannot	1
0	the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering the plug and play ability is aggravating at best freezing two of my computers requiring endless reboots to transfer images photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual the expensive battery is almost impossible to install the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place and the frame is sloppy and dangerous very easy for unit to fall out buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead	1
0	quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 i purchased as gifts in fact the recipients asked me to return them main reason in order for it to be portable it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional 30 i already spent 100 not planning on spending more money i think photoco needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction	1
0	i added these batteries to an order of a few other things and did n't realize that they were going to ship this separately from circuit city make sure if you pick this that you are getting something else from cc or else you will end up like me with a huge box \( you could fit 4 tom clancey novels in the box \) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries	1
0	you have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that i have purchased it i discover that this battery does n't fit this camera it is listed wrong	1
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built they were not interested in even trying to help i hate it when companies only care about their profits	1
0	this unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on off switch has a serious design flaw i received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power after that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on it then failed completely and would not work at at all i returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that on both units the mp3 player continued to work there is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and or the on off switch but for this problem it would be a wonderful unit	1
0	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
0	i 've had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer 's assessment that the battery does not hold much power i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory but this delkin model 's life span was noticeably short now i am going to buy a new charger battery altogether because i do n't want to buy another delkin battery	1
0	in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	1
0	i gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy not a good gift	1
0	i ordered this digital frame for my husband for christmas with the assurance from a tech weenie that it would work based on the advertisement found at amazon still uncertain whether the ad \( also found in philips cursory literature \) is really true my husband is working with the phone people at philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with mac if it does eventually work the process has not been easy	1
0	we returned this video camera due to video picture quality the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video even after changing settings the video had a grainy look we just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work but the picture was worse than our previous camera purchased the pv gs65 next model up with 3ccd 's and love this model as a matter a fact we still had the gs 31 used the same tape shot the same footage and reviewing the two different shots the gs 65 did 100 better the camera has a great feel in your hand although the menu button can be difficult to press	1
0	panasonic offers a usb driver however no video driver this means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer when talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one they offered no suggestions or alternatives	1
0	the camera came with no memory chip the online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund not a great experience	1
0	my husband and i bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting due to weather the snorkeling was canceled but we did end up using the cameras one we used for regular pictures outdoor only beacuse there 's no flash and it was okay though the pictures were a bit grainy the other i took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll i could turn and turn the winder and the film would n't advance but it would let me take another picture after fighting with it the entire weekend i ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out though these were grainy too	1
0	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures	1
0	made the mistake of taking this camera on a trip to the pool ! ! pictures were horrible eye piece is the biggest pain ! ! don't buy this piece of junk if you want great good wonderful pictures buy the fuji quicksnap camera kodak could have done much much better	1
0	i bought this camera after using a sony minidv \( very small one \) camera over 8 years the image quality of sanyo is horrible compared to my old sony under any condition daylight night etc however price size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time so if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it but this is not a serious replacement to a high end camcorder	1
0	this camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to pc via usb however the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto focus which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion the clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation we returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect but the second unit had the same problem apparently according to the manual this is not a malfunction	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars so i ordered it when i got it its like um is that it \? \? \? it 's really cute and really well made but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards also there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it also the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all other than that it 's cute but not the best out there	1
0	i bought these binoculars because i wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding first time out i had difficulty getting a clear focus to make maters worse every bird that i looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it 's head i have a pair of nikon 10x25s which out performed the bushnell 's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness i am returning the bushnell 's and considering the audubon equinox hp binoculars instead	1
0	unless you want to have trouble focusing have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event or have the neck strap bracket break off etc i wear glasses and these never did focus well for me i was not happy when the bracket broke off the day i received them just as i was to leave for an africa safari vacation the biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip and it was frustrating even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired suposedly there is a warranty on these hah ! when i sent them to bushnell for repair they wanted	1
0	i got to the tip of alaska and none of the four batteries worked no power ! i missed getting a day of once in a life time pictures david highe	1
0	did not get kodak max instead recieved regular kodak crv3 battery i thought i was ordering a better version seller needs to change misleading picture !	1
0	in my opinion this is not a marketable product the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit as for hd possibly at high noon in the sahara but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing	1
0	before that it was kind of nice but it cannot focus in even semi low light it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing no way i would call the output hd quality just the best sd ever with a 16 9 format and then it broke	1
0	i have owned this camera for 6 months and have finally deciced to replace it i bought this camera to replace another nikon coolpix that was stolen from my house but this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use i have always liked nikon cameras but the s9 just does n't make it i can not use it outside because i can not see the lcd screen sorry nikon but you blew it on this camera ! ! so i replaced it with a canon powershot a710 what a difference in ease of use and it has a view finder also my 1g memory card from rhe nikon fots in the new canon	1
0	i bougt this camera because i had had a sony coolpix 3 which took great pictures with this camera you can never get it adjusted right if you use the flash the pictures are to light if you dont they are too dark it is a constant battle with this little cute camera worse camera purchase i ever made	1
0	i bought this with my camera and i guess i didnt realize i could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price my bad but i would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending 14 on one tape	1
0	i agree with reviewer steve anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless the paper works says the may focus down to 35' maybe some will but not certainly not my pair i am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard and no the rubber eye caps absolutely will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses \( like me \) scot	1
0	my cheap 10x50 rugged exposure brand binoculars give me a better view the rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and i could n't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round binocular effect i did a side by side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better my vision is not that bad either maybe with perfect vision they would work for but i doubt it	1
0	the roll of paper that i recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper i am trying to get it replaced but adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old i was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues	1
0	unless they had n't insisted on the geared telescopic part it has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time i used it it 's extremely annoying because overall it 's not a bad tripod but it really did n't need that bit of hi tech and now i am unable to use the telescopic part at all yes it 's lightweight and somewhat unstable but i can live with that the biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
0	this camcorder is only good for outdoor recording in indoor recording or recording in little bit low light picture quality is very bad i tried to record in my living room where i have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred in outdoor recording in a sunny day picture quality is quite good with sharp colors zoom works well	1
0	i bought this camera for christmas and it is absolutely horrible ! it takes really bad quality pictures and it has a very noisy lens it 's a great looking camera but the screen is only 2 inches which is very small this camera is not a good buy for it 's class	1
0	do n't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers i 'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 mp nikon coolpix sq as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop what 've i 've discovered however is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 mp images from this hp camera that the additional resolution is worthless the images look absolutely horrible my little nikon sq with it 's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you 're buying is a good one	1
0	the s9000 fits perfectly in the case too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop apparently the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also too bad the camera strap is extremely short made for very small people so instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well i will adapt the case to work for me i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on it will work but only after extensive modification great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	1
0	i have purchased the pv gs65 and everytime i use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds i returned my camcorder and got another one \( pvgs65 \) and i am still having this problem everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus if anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review brandonwg8677 comcast netthank you	1
0	we purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera it took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today 's reasonably priced minidv camcorders however after six months the lcd screen suddenly stopped working it was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great we sent it last november to the panasonic authorized service center they returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available we were out 100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old i only share this as a warning to potential buyers panasonic did not honor our warranty	1
0	if you want a nice camera that works well for 15 months then look no further but mine died completely and is headed for the electronic recycling bin i did n't realize i was getting a disposable when i bought it	1

0	i bought this item over a year ago and it has never served for anything once i spotted a deer and turned on the ir illuminator and the deer ran away not too surprising it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals better use a flashlight this is a first generation nightscope and has a very small range of utility if there is a little light the adapted human eye sees better and if there is almost no light the device does not see either 100 bucks is not too much of a waste but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much	1
0	it was suggested by amazon com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera not knowing any better i bought it it does n't even work with this model camera i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store bypassed the need for an adapter altogether	1
0	it takes too long to focus and shoot ! this coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card well it is horrible people who write in saying they did n't notice the the slow focus and writing must be either paid by nikon or total nubs do not buy this camera it did take decent movies and the size is nice	1
0	poor and slow focus and flash thought nikon had a good name wrongif you like this camera it must be you first digital	1
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked the older model is far superior this camera is slow to focus slow to shoot and slow to save i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition \( indoor medium light \) on the automatic setting all 5 pictures turned out different only one turned out clear i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with	1
0	we have not received this item yet please let me know the current status	1
0	the eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable but of course you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer the whole thing was a waste of time i gave it to my five year old to trash at least he will have some fun with it that way it 's realy just a childs toy	1
0	this is not at all suitable for young children it 's awkward and difficult to use we 're sending it back totally inappropriate for children	1
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
0	nice look good feel turns on fast takes great pictures really great with ridiculous depth of field and resolution you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back which is huge so what 's my beef \? slow pictures double flash slow slow follow on shot slow okay say cheese one second two seconds i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved yes my battery is charged no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye \? slow i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still its awsome slick and a fair price	1

0	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos we promptly sent it back for a refund i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !	1
0	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great but then i realized it would only display 142 images i worked with technical support for several months \( they are not the speediest or most helpful \) i resized renamed restructured the photos tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course only to recieve another with the same problem i would n't recommend this purchase	1

0	i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out \( displaying blue and green pixels \) i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all overall do n't waste your time and money	1

0	grainy iso 100 pictures at any light conditions usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem but if you take pictures with panasonic dmc fz7 and compare it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera i had panasonic dmc fz7 and the only cons is really noisy high iso sensitivity mode in fz8 camera panasonic implemented the venus iii processor \( fz7 has venus ii processor \) as a result picture quality really improved at high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed for the worse in iso 100 mode	1
0	this is a poor excuse for a lens coming from canon can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo please do not waste your money like i did	1
0	i am a novice photographer so take this with a grain of salt i just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components i suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits putting them together must seem self explanatory if you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating it is also frustrating to discover smith victor does not have a support site \( just references on photography \) they do not even provide a support or address keep all this in mind when considering something from this company	1

0	i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt i used it on a vacation mainly and am pretty dissapointed i'm no pro or even skilled amateur but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots the autofocusing is slow and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me i wanted a good all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types i guess this would fit the bill if it took sharp pictures i would n't pay more than 150 for this lens again	1
0	date on still photo will not print it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	1
0	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time at first it worked great then after 2 3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 we returned it to get another and it did the same thing we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal i do not recommend this to anyone	1
0	we returned this item it was a glorified external dvd burner it was not worth the money	1
0	ordered one new from b h in the 1x mode the top light came on no worries turned on the bottom setting of the switch 2x nothing neither light came on pitiful sending it back	1
0	not seeing many reviews i'm writing this as a warning this mic is horrible i bought it to get rid of the quot motor noise quot from my canon optura pi as many others have when i listen now the sound is much worse you can barely hear people speak over the loud humming this mic is horrible	1
0	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find just the right spot i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise i live in a single story 2100 sq foot house i should have returned it right away but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time now 10 months later the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor i love having the video monitor though so i will look for a different brand	1
0	because the camera eye moves only in one direction the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby 's bed you have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib \( older child can crawl away from the view \) or see just a part of it we have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad we went with graco 's excellent digital imonitor	1
0	very dissappointed my son \( i bought this for them \) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used audio just static and noise i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work try telling this to me before i purchase thank you this is the last i purchase equipment on line i will stick to books thank you very much	1
0	this monitor worked pretty well for 4 months we purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver however when we were downstairs \( baby 's room upstairs next to our 's \) the monitor was fuzzy and had static and lines running thru we were still able to have audio recpetion after 4 months the picture disappeared audio was still operational not a good camera for long term	1
0	this camera has a very poor lens at 1x zoom the barrel spherical distortion is enormous try taking a picture of a tiled wall image quality is also so so when a picture is viewed at 100 scaled down on a computer monitor the quality is ok color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance	1
0	review unit had a very large defect in the field of view it 's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube those i am aware of as i have other night vision devices this goes about 1 4 of the way across near the center had to return it poor quality control update the new one does not have any image defects it also does n't focus as sharply as the first one did \( or my other one does \) but it is n't too bad	1
0	it never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months do n't buy you 've been warned	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
0	i loved this camera but i have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous system error 2 design fault which plagues many of these the repair service is slow the camera has been in repair 50 of the year i have had it	1
0	the camera has really amazing features but it also has an outrageously major focus weekness i made a mistake of buying one	1
0	i was down in antarctica when i turned on the camera and it said lens error after a day of missing some of the best pictures of emperor penguins with my 8800 i twisted the lens and got it to work the same thing happened to me in bolivia just after the warranty expired i called nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera do a google search of lens error and nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience this is my third and last nikon	1
0	the camera \( canon s 80 \) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card much less a second battery pack or the charger i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories total waste of	1
0	this case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses briefcases or luggage but do n't count on it to protect your camera from falls dirt or dust it looks good the powershot logo gives an authentic look to it	1
0	when it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50 of the time if i was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher it seemed to become less effective each time i used it to the point that now i'm lucky to get a reading 10 of the time it still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless	1
0	it fits in the s1 but it does n't always charge the contacts arent the same size as the oem version when it does n't charge i just re insert the batter and it works but its sort of a bummer	1
0	i am not satisfied by this product the calrity is not good also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen	1
0	i ordered two of the items above in error i did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from antonline i have been trying since dec 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them i am 71 years old and not computer savvy i just wish i could get return labels and my account credited they are still in the original packing as received and never been opened thank you for being interested i was informed by them that my time had expired i do not believe this to be true or does your opening web page not apply to them	1
0	when mated to a sony wide angle lens the on camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo a major flaw in my opinion sony makes no mention of this on the packaging	1
0	i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera unfortunately it must be leaking electrons all over the place since a charge in this model does not compare to the original i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery the price was cheap and you get what you pay for if you are going to purchase this one get two since you 'll need to keep one charging while using the other cheers	1
0	i bought this over the sony and i regret it i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again that 's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem	1
0	my primary camera is a sony hdr fx1 i bought the gl 2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events the gl 2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image does n't even come close to the sony the price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera however beware of the rebate offer i sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected the rebate facilitator claimed i did not include the upc code if i had it to do over i would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second sony	1
0	this camera took some great pictures and i enjoyed it 's size and functionality for several months i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass the end the lens assembly is shot according to my local camera store not economical to fix this was about the softest fall a camera could take and not work it was like landing on a pillow i will not buy hp cameras again	1
0	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
0	i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed smooth fast transaction five star	1
0	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with so i decided to get this new one i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera but compared to a similar sony model the canon was noticeably louder while operating way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	1
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned i'm not exaggerating i'm so upset for wasting money on it the only pictures that turn out are outside in bright daylight it takes horrible pictures in low light there 's a high level of noise in the photos the video mode moves in and out on its own ruining the video i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos my friend 's 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing it just plain sucks	1

0	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else it does not include a docking station you have to shell out more money for that option i dont think so	1
0	the reviews are worthless unless the writer mentions the model of device they are using the batteries for fifty percent of the reviews here do n't mention what they were using the batteries for do this service justice and mention the type and model equipment for which the battereis are utilized	1
0	pros great resolution nice packaging excellent door stop cons stopped working after 3 weeks horrible overall quality no customer support what so ever since i did n't have a receipt \( ebay purchase \) tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt never got a response now i'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for 199 becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products	1
0	i have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250 00 by this date this lens cost is usd 95 00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20 00 that means you will pay usd 365 00 for a 8x zoom camera for that price or less you can get a 10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200	1
0	i loved this camera when i got it but after three months the lens would not close it makes grinding noises the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again i am very disappointed in this camera	1
0	the en el3a is a works fine and with no problems however amazon is misleading its customers by putting a lower price from a partner company as the primary price of the item amazon should market the item at it 's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner the 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon 's misleading advertisment	1
0	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted never used returned it	1
0	it looks cool and it 's easy to carry but that is about it camera is slow and pictures are often blurry sorry i wasted my money on this one get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue	1
0	the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk	1
0	i really like the size and weight of the camera it is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good i had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable i recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable even outdoors all the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on i will spend a bit more money and get the sony hcr dc96 instead	1
0	the camera is decent the fact that it does n't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable what do they expect 90 of consumers are going to do with it	1
0	watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i	1
0	i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid 's indoor soccer games the light was low but not that low you should be able to take a picture without the flash when i took the flash off the picture looked fine on the preview but came out completely black yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level ! what a disappointment i am going to try to return it	1
0	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars so i ordered it when i got it its like um is that it \? \? \? it 's really cute and really well made but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards also there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it also the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all other than that it 's cute but not the best out there	1
0	hi i have lost the cd rom to download the movie from the camera sony does not offer it for free on its website you have to pay 70 dollars to get it again that clearly disappoints me	1
0	i returned this camera after trying very hard to like picture quality \( movie or still \) is totally unacceptable i did not even get one good still picture forget about indoors video or still the falsh and video light are useless the overall quality of the camera is low	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
0	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger i think it 's odd as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery i do n't know whether the dock works okay because i did n't get that far this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one now i have to buy another battery	1
0	straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality plug into wall and does not work after trying numerous different outlets wiggles of the cord it finally powered on after putting in a card the pics were ok passable the mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more and i was only playing very quiet jazz this is not worth the money even though it is cheap pay a little more and get one that is of better quality	1
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out \( displaying blue and green pixels \) i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all overall do n't waste your time and money	1
0	be careful ordering this item make sure it 's the right one for your camera while it says it 's for the a95 it is n't while it does n't say in the header that it 's the la dc52c it is and the a95 camera requires the la dc52d i had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one i purchased the wrong one based on amazon 's direction when purchasing accessories and do n't want others to make the same mistake	1
0	if you are looking to take high quality pictures then look elsewhere it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what have you but not much else \( or for a beginner in photography or a child \) you have to hold very still if you do n't want your pictures to come out blurry also the flash makes images far too bright and if you do n't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark the only thing i like about this camera is it 's size it 's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag anyway i'm buying a better one soon	1
0	we just bought this camera to replace our minidv jvc dvl500 that was bought in 2000 in short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is very grainy and dark i applied the workaround listed above but found that i had to set the frame rate to 1 15 in order to ge the brightness that i needed which caused a very jittery image the quality of this camera is something that i would expect for 200 needless to say i am returning this camera today	1
0	i returned this item i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited	1
0	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted never used returned it	1

0	after being an amature photographer via print film i decided to try a digital camera though i 've been leary about printing quality i knew i could n't afford a digital slr so i opted for a snap shot camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me however after having and using this camera for a year now i am so disappointed in the performace the flash is just way too much its a washout after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr \( cannon i might add \) i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr	1
0	i purchased this case for my dscs90 i hate it ! it is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else there is no handle to the case in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle the zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so i do n't recommend doing this look for a better case for your new camera	1
0	at least if your going to decieve people about the lcd screen in the back at least make the picture quality decent i mean this barely qualifies as a picture some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light this was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when i had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures definatly stay away from this camera	1
0	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver \( the smallest one you can find \) to achieve it unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to	1
0	this was a waste of money my 5 year old loves taking photos she uses my digital camera sometimes i thought this would be a great gift for her she could see the photos on the back of the camera like mom 's this was not the case the lcd does not project the images and it is so small you can not read what mode you are in if the batteries run out it erases the photos i think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly my daughter was frustrated quickly and it has laid in the drawer for 3 months if your child likes to take photos i would invest in something else	1
0	overall i was entirely disappointed with this camaera the packaging and description were deceiving there was no view finding screen only a teeny tiny window as in a regular camera this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground i would not recommend this to anyone	1
0	i found it on sale luckily because it did not work cute as the dickens and came with a great strap and the art program was fun for the kids but no go on the camera never able to get it to power up yes fresh batteries too we were very disappointed	1
0	i bought this bag looking at the display on amazon but compare to price i paid this bag is not atall good size is small extra pockets are useless where you cant keep much camera pocket is also not convenient only plus point is quality of material used	1

0	i was so dissapointed with this camera ! i purchased a sony cybershot 3 years ago and it had been such a great camera i automatically thought this newer model would be great almost every picture i took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out ! as an experienced cybershot user i tried all settings to fix the problem but no luck terrible for capturing a child 's first steps as the description says would not recommend	1

0	i measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with la crosse charger which i also bought from amazon the capacity ranged from 547 mah to 2002 mah with the average being 886 mah that 's about a third of the stated capacity before i took the measurements i made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of aa nimh batteries la crosse and energizer both scored very close to their stated capacity therefore the test is valid and sunpak 's claim of 2650 mah is grossly overstated my advice avoid sunpak like the plague !	1

0	i received this as a christmas present this digital camera works fine for still shots pictures of my family etc but for action shots kids playing outside basketball games etc it is a big disappointment i took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping i 've taken to several games activities to try it out i 've tried using the different functions adjusting the manual setting and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked many of the shots are blurred have shadows \( because of movement \) or are so dark the people ca n't be seen i wish i would have known this before i asked for this camera	1
0	if you purchase this lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos	1
0	after receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera i discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate for instance you cannot access the cf card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount also taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle this is not useable for a carry around use i have it sitting in the corner of my office unused spent good money for nothing	1
0	bought this case along with a digital rebel xti my first slr instead of the 18 55mm kit lens i opted for the sigma 17 70mm lens sad to say but the case fits only with the kit lens the rebel xti with the 17 70mm lens barely fits so a word of cuation to everyone if you 're planning on anything other than the kit lens then do n't get this	1
0	this is a poorly designed camera case you have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures i expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot i was very disappointed this is rather a leather box than a camera case	1

0	if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos it does work well for video the sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself is a disappointment	1
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it not kidding ! when i first got it i called kodak and they told my son \( who is knowledgeable in this stuff \) how to reset the printer we reset it and it worked for awhile then it would n't work any more and i did away with it no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	1
0	we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new and one day the lens just wo n't open it lights up then after a few seconds it turns off automatically called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair the price they 've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon ! i 'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point so i'm expecting a believable quote for repairs i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera	1
0	i'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera onher wish list if not i would of been upset having recieved the wrong camerathat i ordered	1
0	i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series my adapter arrived and it does n't work with my camera kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately bummer also captain jack is correct about the vignetting this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built in zoom lens if you zoom wide angle you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned if you stay zoomed in it works ok disappointing	1
0	this is a nice looking brown suede camera case based on all the stylus models listed i assumed my olympic stylus 595 would fit in it but unfortunately it does not	1
0	i do n't know what case others got some have said too tight but mine was very loose the camera is swimming around in the case easily half a centimeter of clearance not recommended just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case	1
0	rated one star for the lack of value you can buy the same canon brand case for under 14 and a higher capacity imho better albeit non name brand 1200mah battery for under 10 from amazon the neck strap is not worth the difference	1
0	this was my second camcorder after a canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise this panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 months \( well 3 months and a week thereby a week too late for the warranty and a too bad so sad response from panasonic ! \) i had used it to film a wedding it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan do not buy this camera	1
0	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips are they abandoning this product \? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself	1
0	while the everio will work on a mac it is with jvc 's movie program it is not imovie ready there is a very strange work around involving dvdrop that will make it work not very pleased with what i feel is misleading information about compatibility with mac	1
0	i agree with the many other users who have experienced the condensation operation paused defect on their jvc gr xxxx despite numerous others reporting this problem jvc says its not a recognized problem i would disagree it is a recognized problem but its your problem not theirs	1
0	this is a good charger quick and portable but the battery life of the battery sucks !	1
0	i got this charger with my sd110 and within a few months it stopped working it was obviously a battery problem the battery is n't the best quality either but when i got a new one the problem persisted so obviously it 's the charger	1
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	it sounds like a good system if it worked you cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have a wireless computer network or a cordless phone \( 2 4 ghz \) or a microwave that is running i'm not kidding i ca n't believe this even passed testing i think mobicam has a newer system that you should investigate owning those have lots of reviews pay attention to them	1
0	decent camera but not great shark mode is nice housing looks good but mine leaked at 20 ft camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present next time i will buy a housing for a better camera canon has some nice ones	1
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense it sucks i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality if you get closer than five inches the pictures messes up i 've had no other problem with the hardware though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed oh and night photos also suck big time even with the flash on	1
0	bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot with extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it the velcro does not hold it closed well either my memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes thank goodness my husband noticed	1
0	i have an olympus fe 100 camera and the battery did not fit ! my niece has an olympus fe 140 camera and the battery did not fit in hers either ! the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck	1
0	poor focus blurry awful optics do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features	1
1	this is a great back pack ! if there is anything i would change it would be the logo on the front it 's brite and shinny and i 'd rather not advertise that i have a camera in there ! i colored it in with a felt pen and it works great overall i love the backpack ! !	1
1	i love this backpack ! it is just what i needed to safely carry my camera gear and keep it organized	1
1	this was the best item i ever bought for my camera i do a lot of walking with my camera and thought i would use it as a walking stick which i do but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
1	price went up ! ! ! great value for money spent will be buying a ball attachment for better adjustability got some great steady shots with 48x digital zoom with the canon s2 i	1
1	i enjoy the tc80n3 you may think it 's costly but the features are out standing i think it was worth the buy the only disappointment i have is there is no on off power switch	1
1	i'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is much better than another but for my canon ef s 10 22mm on a 20d i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded canon it fits fine does n't interfere with the lens hood looks clear seems to attenuate that nasty ultra violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all protects the front element what more would one want	1
1	this is a good affordable uv filter for protecting your expensive lenses i leave it on my lens all the time this particular filter \( l 39 sharp cut \) is especially good for wide angle lenses \( lt 24mm focal length \) because of its ultrathin profile which prevents vignetting i have used regular filters on wide angle lenses with very bad results although this filter is not multi coated i have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures i 've taken multi coated uv filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one which i do n't think is worthwhile all in all i recommend this filter for canon or non canon lenses	1
1	i did n't have a ton of time to research this flash i 've used it now on several occasions with my canon 5d and could n't be happier with it it 's great for shooting portraits i can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser get 's rid of the typical flash harsh light	1
1	i'm very happy with my speedlite 580ex is a new dimension for my photographic hobb	1
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
1	wow ! ! ! this is my 4th sony i keep trading up and i am so impressed there is no delay on the shutter speed great pictures and enough special effects to be fun but not enough that you need a phd to operate	1
1	i have been using my sony cybershot dscn1 8 1mp for about a month now it 's so easy to use and i love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen the only issue i have with it is that i ca n't use the memory pro stick with my sony photo printer \( a 5 year old model \) because the stick is not compatible ps do n't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera you 're gonna need it	1
1	good remote can be finnicky at times if not lined up correctly with the camera	1
1	i like using a tripod with my long zoom lens and this device has really added to my hobby the remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard i personally do n't like cables i do n't like dealing with them this is just right for my purposes the remote is also better for taking pics of people it is much better than a timer in my opinion since i can move people in and out easier and more efficiently taking pictures more quickly this gives me so much more control than using a timer	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
1	this lens has extremely fast \( and quiet \) focus and is razor sharp what more could you want when photographing wildlife up close	1
1	i read many reviews at fredmiranda com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2 8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp be carefull with this lens though the dof at f2 8 is extremely narrow do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer canon how about a 100mm macro with is \?	1
1	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras \( ie the 20d 30d rebels etc \) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already great lens great color so well built super sharp just watch out if this is your first l lens you 'll be hooked this is a lens you will have for many years great investment	1
1	i am very happy with this set of filters the price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite camera and filters	1
1	i am starting my career as a professional photographer and i have n't had any problems with these filters they come in a nice case and are easy to attach to my lenses	1
1	this lens works really fast it is a great lens captures the color in real depth and detail with my canon 20d camera	1
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
1	for the money you absolutely ca n't beat this lens it 's very fast and sharp not fast to focus but what do you expect at 70 \? i have four lenses some costing 4x 's as much as this one yet i use this one the most anyone looking to step up from the kit lens or anyone looking to buy a camera body w out the kits lens should look to buy this lens	1
1	very happy with the lens and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
1	this is a great lens for star fields it is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest the focus was sharp to the corners without coma see my photo of a portion the milky way this was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a rebel xt on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table	1
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	i do not trust any batteries except canon for my canon cameras i have found compatible batteries do not always charge incanon charger and do not last as long on camera	1
1	this is an excellent battery that powers my canon 5d camera very well although i have n't tested it against the spec for how many shots i can get from it i 've been very impressed with the longevity of it 's charge	1
1	this uv filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands	1
1	make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of l series lenses are compatible if you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition the af only works with lenses f 4 and faster on most camera bodies you do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body but the extra reach is really nice	1
1	i was able to use the canon ef 1 4x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all you could see the hairs on the animals heads it 's fantastic	1
1	this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a 4 star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it 's a good product	1
1	i already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my efs 17 85 mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing well canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the lp1116 this pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens the cord is strong and silky and does n't open accidently the way a silky cord would obviously we ca n't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand the moment i buy another lens i shall have to buy its matching pouch	1
1	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
1	i 'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if i said that care of lenses for slr cameras required a decent lens cap this one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses \( canon and otherwise \) so just be sure to confirm that that it 's the proper size for your lens	1
1	i purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here and i have taken pictures from alaska to florida and in washington i love how the mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take best camera i have every use	1
1	very good rechargable battery pack holds charge for a long time even if camera is not used much capable of taking many shots with plenty of review time very pleased with it	1
1	i gave this monopod to my boyfriend as a gift and it 's been perfect for his use he videotapes his kids 's baseball and softball games and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long he did n't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down so a monopod seemed like a great idea he has loved it ! ! he says it keeps the camera very steady and it 's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing he 's no professional but he uses his camcorder a lot and he 'll be happily using the monopod for a long time	1
1	this lens is fantastic very fast colors that will blow you away 2 8f stop can set very fast sutter speeds i put this lens on my reble xt and i dont want to take it off love it amazon great	1
1	i purchased the canon off camera shoe cord to use with the canon ex 580 for weddings i needed the cord to use the flash on a braket to avoid red eye it does what it 's supposed to no complaints	1
1	this is the first is lens that i 've owned i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef s lens this makes its effective focal length about 45 215mm on my digital rebel i love the zoom range \( great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces \) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under share your own customer images pete leclairhttp www agentz com digitalimagesbyjpl	1
1	the balance with the grip on is really much better yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones but mine seems just fine \( knocking on wood as i type \)	1
1	eos 1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months a little hard to use because it has a lot of things i am not a proffecianal but i liked very muchthe pictures is the best like any camera i had	1
1	i recently purchased this for use with my 550ex if you use alot of flash for event photography you will want this in your kit it is expensive but i think it is worth every penny it will keep you from changing aas in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant you can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure you can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt mounting on my 20d was just not comfortable it gets in the way of the hand grip	1
1	this is a wonderful lens with great image quality very fast and very good build quality no complaints	1
1	this lens is great i 've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful ! the only downside is the lack of ability to zoom other than that it 's a great lens	1
1	this is a great lens for any user professional or amateur this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive clean results a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm \( 16mm cropped \) but this is easily correctable with software in addition the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door architecture shots \( especially realtors \)	1
1	i had the tokina 12 24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens this canon focuses faster and is wider if you 're worried about full frame in the future do n't be just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images it light fast and sharp l quality pictures the build could be better but i do n't see any problems down the road	1
1	i highly recommend this super wide angle lens for anyone wanting to take landscape pictures buildings or lots of other stuff ! it is so different than the standard kit lens \( 18 55 \) you wo n't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens	1
1	this is original equipment battery charger manufactered by canon the performance of the charger is excellent as are most canon products the price paid was comparible to non sale priced items puchased via internet sites the item was recieved in original packaging 3 days after placing the order was new \( not reconditioned with a new appearance \) i am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping	1
1	slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the s \( 40 45 50 \) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras seems to charge in about the same time feels a bit more substantial but that 's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy i ca n't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras \( which i lost \)	1
1	this is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier canon digital elph that i lost several years ago the 7 1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures in fact the digital zoom also works great just make sure the camera is steady \( i purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome \) although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have you ca n't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes the canon sd500 is a great little camera	1
1	holds all my lenses camera body remote card reader etc with room to spare compares to bags costing 3 times more	1
1	i won the kodak printer at a scrapbook convention then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest beat out anything i could find in the local stores it is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store 's website wait a few days go there pick it up etc great value	1
1	hi have a rebel extreme and needed to use the high speed mode but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up i was taking pictures of dancers so needed a flash system that could keep up the speedlite really does this perfectly i'm able to take a rapid fire sequence of photos and this flash system is there each time i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo but if you want a flash that can keep up this one is great ! i like it so much i'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot to run in slave mode with this one	1
1	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	1
1	i cannot help but giggle when i saw comments like great lens for the money it is selling for 440 at here even on so called clearance however one can easily find the same lens at least 50 cheaper at some decent online camera store such as b h ritz camera etc sad amazon	1
1	i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras one kodak and another canon \( a70 \) amazing product pro almost everything cons no audio on videoi definetly recommend the product for the price	1
1	the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility the stabilization aspect is a great help although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt	1
1	this camera is excellent one ! ! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category i'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles highly recommended	1
1	it is extremely easy to use hard to figure out the menu but once that is done there is no problem takes beautiful pictures great for action shots as well seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in	1
1	excellent product easy to use great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork i ca n't wait to experiment with it	1
1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	1
1	this monopod does a great job for my camera you have the quick easy off it attatches to your camera by a screw and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly i wanted a nice inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense i have a canon 35mm and i recently purchased a 75 300 zoom lense for it and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot if i knew then what i know now i would buy it again nice product	1
1	it was everything it was reported to be it works very well we take it on every trip we take	1
1	fast delivery great price i would buy from them again thanks	1
1	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
1	i 've bought several lenses from adorama two of which include a new 300 2 8 is and the other this 500 4 is all of their deliveries were prompt and well packed i have zero complaints with them i dealt the john \( green i think is his last name \) via email i highly recommend them as for this lens it is incredible wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background \( good bokeh \) af is very fast this lens is extremely good and will still af when used with the 1 4x converter \( af works up to f5 6	1
1	i love the new digital canon the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin i had the camera less than a month when the pop up flash quit working the canon people have been great and very helpful but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory the photos however are wonderful film quality for the most part printable and enlargable \( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos	1
1	my sony dscw100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby	1
1	i was able to scout out the different case options for my sony dsc n1 after much review i asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the lcs nb it holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery so far so good	1
1	sony has done it again ! fast charging and long lasting this battery is perfect for my sony cyber shot camera !	1
1	it 's a pretty convinient bag i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28 75 lens a canon 70 300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet keys etc the only drawback of this bag is you can not put in big lenses the canon 70 300 is the limit but if you only have a limited gear collection you need to give it a try	1
1	it was everything it advertised as being i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras being a slingshot backpack my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack	1
1	i just got back from vacation i have a bad back and it was sore i was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs i could carry my nikon d 70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses i have other bags which heft lots of gear and they 're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot but if you 're looking to hike \( and have a separate way to carry a tripod \) then this is a wonderful bag	1
1	this is an excellent device quick respond with my d80 i use it to take the family pictures that include me i just point and press this remote to activate the d80 's timer and it works beautifully	1
1	i use it with my nikon d70 and am very satisfied with it i most often use it for long exposures for taking picture that include myself and for taking pictures of my 6 month old daughter who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold the camera so i place it on the tripod and take pictures of her	1
1	this camera does all that canon says it does fantastic pictures great flexibility for manual control or simple point and shoot use i did a lot of research before buying and i could not be happier with the canon g6	1
1	i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit for a starting photographer the price was right and i have not noticed any quality issues the uv filter stays on a lens at all times as it 's cheaper to replace the filter than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired the light polarizer is very handy and also works very well cutting down greatly on glare i have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet the filter case is a nice extra it fits right in my camera bag and is out of the way untill i need it	1
1	excellent product works as expected like all lens hoods though pricey	1
1	xti is feature laden but takes fantastic point and shoot photos seems to be a significant improvement on canon 's rebel xt a wonderful camera for the money the best slr going	1
1	this is one fantastic flash i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
1	easy to use including zoom and uploading to computer nice clear photos when printed out	1
1	im a graphic design student in college so i really needed a camera i decided on this one and i am really glad i did the pictures are nice and clean the camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact the only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick but i just took them out when i wasnt using them buy this camera	1
1	i took this with me recently to australia and shot landscapes as well as others and the pictures came out better than the film cameras i have used recently plus you do n't need a scanner this camera works great a must have for semi pros pros wait for the new 1d pictures come out great at 11 quot x17 quot	1
1	am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one i do not like that the viewfinder is no longer operational once you flip open the lcd screen sometimes i like to verify my shot with both	1
1	i'm still learning to use this camera and all the features so far it is amazing i 've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots i use the auto mode a lot and it works great the zoom is amazing i love that it tells me when i am focused also it has great battery life i'm very happy with this camera	1
1	when i had seen this camera on net i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small handy except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always its a great camera the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it	1
1	this tripod was a total shock ! i was amazed at the quality stability and portability the heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus the level and quick release were also a welcome surprise this was the best 9 00 i ever spent for photography accessories	1
1	the previous review is not completely correct the problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon com put up for the canon cpm e3 battery magazine it is a battery magazine for the canon compact battery pack cp e3 and not for the camera battery grip i think the product itself is a great thing it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the canon compact battery pack cp e3 the previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer	1
1	easy fast and serius tool for cleaning your optics the easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand cleaning is fast with the nikon lens pen cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done as any profesional tool now i have 2 of them for my two camera bags	1
1	great flash all the good qualities of the sb800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire ! it has the built in flash disperser its lighter than the 800 so unless you 're into more info than you need go with the sb600 oh it has a shorter recycle time too	1
1	since this is my first digital camera i really ca n't compair it to others out there however it does everything i need it to do and has more features than i make use of ! i 've never had a problem with it	1
1	yep it extends the eyepiece out a little bit which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display but it also distorts the view in an annoying way i use mine on occasion but not all the time	1
1	this lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max on full zoom the magnification was not as sharp as without the close up lens	1
1	i love the new digital canon the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin i had the camera less than a month when the pop up flash quit working the canon people have been great and very helpful but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory the photos however are wonderful film quality for the most part printable and enlargable \( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos	1
1	easily snaps in place and does the job considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet and delivery was quick as well	1
1	the canon rs 60e3 is all that canon says it is it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash focus then release the shutter once a multiple of times or hold it open for bulb exposure although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture it was simple enough to make an extension that allows for very remote exposures	1
1	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful esp with macro shots highly recommend	1
1	2 years of heavy use not even one little bitty problem they 've traveled well under harsh conditions and they still function wonderfully there you go	1
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
1	fits my canon sd550 perfectly and no complains abt that the quality of the product is pretty good when used with the belt clip its easy to open and easy to put the camera back camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip	1
1	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product great quality nevertheless	1
1	though the lenses for my nikon d50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass this size 52mm was what was specified for my d50 and it fits perfectly as it should i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller if you are new to digital slr 's like i was then get this filter to protect your lens and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens	1
1	this filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear it remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter	1
1	wonderful camara excellent characteristics has an ample selection of accessories available and protected by one of you lead in manufacture of camaras and lenses	1
1	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
1	works great on my s2is clicked on silver on main page but switched to black on order form did n't notice this but i like the black anyway looks good with acc	1
1	i bought this camera for my sister as an early christmas present thinking i would need some time to set it up for her well in less then 30 minutes i was ready it 's a awesome camera i was impressed of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone great photos from very close to far away i would recommend this camera to anyone	1
1	seems a little much to pay for an extension cord but upon receipt i see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors plus its a brand item from canon so what can you do	1
1	the item was exactly as expected the packaging for shipment along with the other item i ordered was unacceptable a child could have done better	1
1	this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras digital camera rule 1 always carry a spare battery the kit is almost worth it for that alone the leather case is great stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too it may not be everyone 's cup of tea but i like it it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and do n't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
1	although this is a good batch of accessories the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times it has no carry strap the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top so if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture you must open the case pull the camera 's strap through the slit then lift the camera out it would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy	1
1	now that i have had this on my camera for a while now my camera feels so weird with it off i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to i wish the buttons were the same plastic chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain	1
1	canon 's bg e3 battery grip is one awesome extra you cannot be without i found the extra weight and size not to be even a minor burden i rec 'd product 2 days after initial receiving date 17th st photo did a fantastic job \( once again \)	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with	1
1	i have been using this lens for about 2 5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment especially for the price ! i very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than i can achieve with this lens it 's very solidly built and i am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come	1
1	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed it is easy to use in fact i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand made craftsmanship of the watches its f2 5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you	1
1	it is working well and it is sturdy i dropped on the ground when playing frisby but nothing happened	1
1	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these and the charger is okay just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most	1
1	i do n't have that much stuff but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder fits my canon xti with my canon 50 mm attached my kit lens my new canon 70 300 is my panasonic video cam minor accessories \( extra batteries cables memory cards etc \) there are separators with velcros inside so you can configure the bag however you want it the only issue i have with this bag is that i wa n't able to configure it to store my xti with my 70 300 attached	1
1	this bag is great for your slr digtial camera it has space for your extra lens everything that came with you slr camera fits in this bag this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive	1
1	holds all my lenses camera body remote card reader etc with room to spare compares to bags costing 3 times more	1
1	this is a good teleconverter that added 1 5x to the camera 's native zoom it adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots	1
1	if you have the big lenses \( 400mm f 2 8l is usm or even the 70 200mm f 2 8l is usm \) this is totally worth the addition the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f 2 8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges check compatability on canon 's website you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	purchased a printer dock and camera bundle from a local office supply store for 100 it only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge so i purchsed this from amazon amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping it works great no complaints the paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that i still use for some pictures but works well for my classroom to give to my students the pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them	1
1	i love the new digital canon the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin i had the camera less than a month when the pop up flash quit working the canon people have been great and very helpful but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory the photos however are wonderful film quality for the most part printable and enlargable \( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos	1
1	now this is n't the fastest card on the market but it is a solid reliable card the camera itself is the bottle kneck and typically not this card however if you are using a canon dslr of a recent flavor i would check if it needs to be rma 'd a known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images scary however i 've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or rebel xt i 've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my pd70x and definately not with my rebel xt	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
1	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras \( ie the 20d 30d rebels etc \) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already great lens great color so well built super sharp just watch out if this is your first l lens you 'll be hooked this is a lens you will have for many years great investment	1
1	hi have a rebel extreme and needed to use the high speed mode but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up i was taking pictures of dancers so needed a flash system that could keep up the speedlite really does this perfectly i'm able to take a rapid fire sequence of photos and this flash system is there each time i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo but if you want a flash that can keep up this one is great ! i like it so much i'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot to run in slave mode with this one	1
1	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	1
1	the camera handles very well it 's light and drives my zoom lens and 18 55mm lens beautifully i get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight which it does not have the view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful showing photos as they are taken with zoom on the back screen which immediately gives me the idea of the photo i want to use in my books i say this is an outstanding lens and camera	1
1	this lens is outstanding speed and sharpness are top notch i use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results best lens in it 's class at a reasonable price it 's well built sturdy and not so heavy so it 's relatively easy to carry around canon really impressed me with this lens i use it with my eos system \( traditional and digital cameras \)	1
1	i use this gem on my 20d along with my 24 105mm and as far as i'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there my 24 105 is n't the ideal indoor low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens \( although it is sharp just not quite long enough \) the 70 200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with is to boot ! the photos i 've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers if you can afford it do it you wo n't regret i	1
1	i spent alot of time evaluating this product finally after reading the reviews i dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense it has been a wounderful addition to my canon reble it is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time	1
1	i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field this tripod works well for that use it is sturdy has lots of features and is reasonably priced however if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars a right angle adapter will be needed i found one on ebay for a few dollars	1
1	this is a replacement for an identical battery pack that i lost works great long life no problems	1
1	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
1	i am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera occaisionally when i turn it on the lense doies n't slide out which is a little disconcerting however if i tap it or turn it off and turn it o n again it comes out to the operational position i enjoy using it amd would n't hesitate to purchase another one	1
1	excellent choice to make a great job	1
1	this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment i do n't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera coupled with an l series zoom lens	1
1	the balance with the grip on is really much better yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones but mine seems just fine \( knocking on wood as i type \)	1
1	over the years i have been using quantum turbo and later 2x2 units \( no turbo sc yet \) to power various canon speed lights from 540ez to ex580 with some skepticism i picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment well although quantum units still have a place in my kit to power metz unit i love the convenience of cp e3 one recommendation buy couple of extra battery inserts if you do lot of fast shootings and keep them loaded with good quality duracell nimh 's	1
1	i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f 2 8 version overall i was very happy with the f 4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses and the f 4 can provide plenty of background blur if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f 4	1
1	this was the best item i ever bought for my camera i do a lot of walking with my camera and thought i would use it as a walking stick which i do but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
1	not knowing fully what i was getting into on a whim i purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half way decent product i mean it was so cheap i was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what i had was a very high quality monopod this was my second monopod and so i had another to compare it with \( the other was bought on an auction website \) in comparison the opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and i use it exclusively on my minidv shoots	1
1	the case is great ! it fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what i expected to receive when ordering the price was right but the shipping was a little higher than i expected	1
1	i purchased this case for my canon a530 camera i find that it does a great job of being light durable and compact it keeps the camera clean and scratch free however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips i use different ones for different pictures or video batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn that can be a bit akward otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well	1
1	i read many reviews at fredmiranda com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2 8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp be carefull with this lens though the dof at f2 8 is extremely narrow do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer canon how about a 100mm macro with is \?	1
1	this was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable they sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly	1
1	the np bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature	1
1	it was everything it advertised as being i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras being a slingshot backpack my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack	1
1	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
1	this is an excellent device quick respond with my d80 i use it to take the family pictures that include me i just point and press this remote to activate the d80 's timer and it works beautifully	1
1	this lens is amazing nothing escapes it it 's like a black hole clearly the best lens i have ever owned it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera it comes with a beautiful case a hood and a tripod mount on the lens believe me you will need it i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great i will now get to work reading the small manual it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings wow !	1
1	this thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not so fattening way i hvae an external flash macro kit 28 80 lens 50mm lens 18 55mm lens dslr w batt grip and 75 300mm lens attached all fit into the main body of this thing everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking hiking biking etc the addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you 'd want but the bag all by itself is fantastic and i ca n't recommend it enough get away from huge bulky shoulder bags ! ! lowepro did it again	1
1	after using both lenses i think this is much better here are my reasons 1 f 2 8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate 2 bokeh is much better in this one 3 macro is slightly better on this one 4 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size 5 is is not very crucial in 24 50 range	1
1	this lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality it compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul	1
1	i am not much of a photographer i found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great believe me it 's the camera the stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time i can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily i'm thrilled you do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb memory card when you buy the camera	1
1	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time	1
1	i bought this filter for my 28 135 is canon lens and so far it has worked out great unlike some of the other tiffen filters i bought this one fits just right on the lens all sides are even and it sits flush against the lens i have n't noticed any artifacts from pictures i 've taken yet but i have n't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens the night shots i 've take so far i 've been quite pleased with however	1
1	i absolutely love this camera i 've told everyone i know to buy it the picture quality is amazing there are so many options with this tiny little camera ! you can edit pictures before you even print them zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way and so much more i take pictures of everything ! i charged the battery when i got the camera which was about three weeks ago and it 's still going i have 7 8th of battery life left i have n't had to charge it again i am so happy with my purchase ! i hope this helps you	1
1	i just got this camera a month ago and i am satisfied with it it has a lot of features despite its size and for point and shoot i can say it 's a great buy comparable to other power packed cameras it even takes better pictures sometimes but i just had to give it a 4 because i thought i could do more with it but you ca n't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions but over all it 's a great camera if you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek this is definitely a good buy	1
1	yes it is a very fine lens is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24 70 2 8l after 2 weeks of usage f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier bokeh is also worse than the other one the viewfinder gets darker in 1 6 crop bodies 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size plus the macro option is weaker on this one if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24 70 2 8l imho	1
1	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration	1
1	for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe i too around 5000 photos i posted a few on the web \( see link below \) for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and \( almost \) very sharp get this lens instead of the kit lens \( 18 55 mm \) until you are ready to spend more here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens \( images have been compressed \) http www laplazita net europa	1
1	this camera is a steal the reviews on amazon helped me decide on this camera and sure it is worth it	1
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
1	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed the white box is for general use also available are the green omni bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni bounce for a warming effect pros inexpensive solution for better flash photography a quality product that works cons non	1
1	love this battery long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
1	works as great as orignal battery you will never know the difference except that is a lot cheaper !	1
1	i 've had this battery for 3 months so i do n't have long term experience but so far it 's been excellent no better or worse then the original canon battery i would reccomend it to anyone	1
1	this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life i bought it when i first got my sd10 when one battery runs out the spare goes in the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it	1
1	i have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last this is my first slr and i am not in the least disappointed this camera meets or exceeded everything i expected from it very easy to learn read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures i highly recommend this camera	1
1	i recently moved into the prosumer level of digital the canon d30 has proven to be an awesome camera there maybe better \( d60 \) but if you are serious about digital the d30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price there is a slight lag between shots but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains the time between shots is hardly a distraction	1
1	i took this with me recently to australia and shot landscapes as well as others and the pictures came out better than the film cameras i have used recently plus you do n't need a scanner this camera works great a must have for semi pros pros wait for the new 1d pictures come out great at 11 quot x17 quot	1
1	wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take	1
1	my search for a semi pro digicam made me do a lot of research and after i shortlisted a few models i had to find the best deal amazon helped me get that deal and today when i look at the performance of the camera so far i am amazed the camera was bound to be good but a special thanks to amazon com for helping me get one at a gr8 price	1
1	it 's a 72mm lens hood no vigneting works great a must for using ef28 135 outdoors	1
1	i had viewed concert photos taken with the s2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they did n't even come close i was using the canon a80 prior and while i was happy with it my first round of photos with the s2 proved to be most impressive while you can use this as a point and shoot this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it and although the s3 is the latest version of the camera i'm not sure you get that much more for the money	1
1	i'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power it 's compact not heavy has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right in addition to the light output the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced an excellent feature getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally brochure reading averse twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment but had given up both i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit	1
1	an excellent flash to use with my canon 20d at a fantastic price the canon 580ex was an expensive option but should i buy one in the future \? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit great product from canon as always	1
1	have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting at sporting events \( indoor and outdoor \) and at concerts fast focusing and great image stabilization \( is does use quite a bit more power though \) have not had one problem with it solid build and has a little heft to it it is a bit pricey but i chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
1	i mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the s2 is it does well to protect the lens but you ca n't put a lens cap over it it ends up being easier to use without the lens cap and quicker when taking pictures the pictures are very good through it	1
1	i have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it it is as fantastic as others note herein the 2 8 through the focus range is really great superb the vr function is really a neat trick it is super fun to play with the drawbacks are size and weight after a 1 2 hour of shooting your arms will get tired remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera this lens is definately heavy enough to bend warp the camera body	1
1	puts a protective glass over your expensive gla without distortion	1
1	this gadget is a must have for gadget lovers and picture lovers it is compact solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag the images are crisp if you get it set appropriately if you love attention get this product and if you do n't not to worry the camera gets all of it	1
1	after waiting months for an order to be filled and then getting screwed by customer service returns i decided never to buy from amazon again go to an electronics or camera store you 'll get better service and the fresh air will do you good	1
1	this handy little tool is a must have for not just nikon owners but all camera owners a genius of design and function i would whole heartedly urge every person with a camera to buy one or many asap	1
1	it gave me the option to change the angle of the light this is a nice option to have i am sure	1
1	i'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1 to this camera ! i 've had it for 2 years now and i just love it ! thanks to it i discovered i had a real passion for photography it 's very easy to use and my pictures are great ! when i show them people usually tell me you must have an expensive camera and i just show them my little canon s500 and they are surprised with the result ! i'm just loving it	1
1	i love this flash i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual i would definitely recommend this flash	1
1	the cover over the lense broke small lcd screen pictures are pritty good battery life is pritty good some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady takes nice portaits easy to use has a veiw finder	1
1	i had a chance to compare it with a tokina glass canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion same or even slightly worse on a sharpness and complete looser on a build quality if you are ok with 12mm get tokina	1
1	excellent camera kit versatile i have a lot to learn about the camera though as it is no simple point and shoot however in auto mode it takes great point and shoot pictures i look forward to learning how to use it fully lenses came with warranty cards but the camera itself did not i bought the sb 600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 gb compact flash cards to round out the kit camera with lens attached is large which i underestimated 80 camera bag is too small for it all great camera though price was the best i could find anywhere	1
1	i purchased this camera a year ago \( summer 05 \) definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera but after a year mine is still working perfectly	1
1	i am new to slrs and i cant belive how good this camera is this camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces i always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent but looking back they look terrible compared to this	1
1	i had 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses while i had owned other digitals i keep going back to my old rebel until now we got the back up battery pack my husband and i love it	1
1	this small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money it 's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens	1
1	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
1	nice quality but overpriced does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens and reducing glare in some situations	1
1	good basic set of inexpensive filters nice case great for a beginner starting set if you 're willing to spend more money on filters getting b w or hoya will suit you better	1
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
1	excellent case no question about it it is stylish and well put together this can not be worn on a belt though it must go in a pocket purse or in your hand the main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound and it looks good doing it	1
1	case is pretty much what you see i have no complaints \) the case protects my camera very well	1
1	the camera is a superb light weight wonder the controls are logical and the large display area is amazing i love it	1
1	i 've had my d70s for about a year now have n't regretted it for a second the controls are laid out logically with everything to hand the dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate i personally love the optional grid overlay i have no excuses for horizons that are n't horizontal the wireless flash system is great though you have to buy an sb 600 or sb 800 to get the full benefit this camera is bigger and heavier than the d50 and d80 which in my opinion is a positive thing	1
1	i do weddings portrait and outdoor photography and i do n't see any reason why i 'd ever switch from the d70 \( other than the d80 \) this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point do n't be scared by the 6 1 mp i print at 20x30 all the time w out any problems i 'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
1	this filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses	1
1	i'm using it for a few months now i have n't found a single problem so far earlier i was using an old finepix and the optic sensor sensitivity was not very good poor quality of photos taken in dark environment this is not a problem any more also i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom in general i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out \) sure there are better cameras on the market however considering the price it is just a great deal	1
1	i went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes it 's amazing	1
1	these cameras are as simple to use as any i have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much great buy	1
1	the quality is definitely great when attached to the s3 is it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots if you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography i suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood	1
1	i use my canon 10d mainly for astrophotography most of the time it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods oftime anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes this ack e2adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or adrained one while i control the camera remotely sitting inside myhouse continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flashstorage the package included several ac power connectors which isvery useful while travelling amazon provides a wide range of itemsto choose from	1
1	compare to the price of the product i highly recommend to any one who own canon eos camera	1
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
1	this is a fabulous and reliable camera feels solid fantastic pictures easy to operate a new d40 has been announced over the past few days but its lack of an lcd display and buttons to manage basic camera controls \( to reduce weight and make it more user friendly \) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr expect prices to fall as the d40 becomes available	1
1	my first digicam bought it 2 years ago simple to use great pictures and a year ago \( and hundreds of pictures ago \) i dropped it \( no in its case \) on a cobblestone road no damage have never seen the need to replace it i like the common batteries it uses and the sd memory	1
1	aside form the fact that canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic the remote switch does work well it does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the canon cameras people with big hands may have a little trouble using this product overall a must have addition for anyone interested in long exposures images with excellent sharpness and depth of field	1
1	it is simple handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button	1
1	this is the first is lens that i 've owned i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef s lens this makes its effective focal length about 45 215mm on my digital rebel i love the zoom range \( great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces \) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under share your own customer images pete leclairhttp www agentz com digitalimagesbyjpl	1
1	from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colorscons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrastyfor myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the 1 6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens	1
1	this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras digital camera rule 1 always carry a spare battery the kit is almost worth it for that alone the leather case is great stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too it may not be everyone 's cup of tea but i like it it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and do n't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
1	i 've had my d2h for 9 months now i 've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it skin tones on my unit are great it seems this issue plagued a minority of users camera is very fast exposes well and delivers results it 's primarily designed to be a sports and photojournalism camera for situations where speed counts it 's a 4 megapixel wonder it 's true it only has 4 megapixels but they are 4 great megapixels images upsize wonderfully i love my unit and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup or wait for the d2x the price of the d2x is making that decision a bit easier and i'm leaning toward another d2h	1
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures buttons are fairly intuitive instructions are understandable and there 's nothing like being the first kid on the block with a new toy getting all sorts of comments about my picture show	1
1	the battery is great but amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery plus a mini dv tape and a carrying case for the same price the case is useless for the zr series but might come in handy for some other purpose	1
1	it 's well designed the protection is very good but you should know it 's pretty compact you can put only the camera inside nothing else also take care about the color it has some pink on it if you are a relly macho and worry about it better look for options	1
1	what 's not to like \? light compact and comes with the strap case and wipe cloth they are perfect keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still	1
1	small and compact let me see everyting i wanted to	1
1	have had good luck with these batteries they last for a long time first time with amazon and it was a good experience will use them again	1
1	i love this camera the first day i received it i took 3 rolls of film it has been the best purchase i bought this year i got a real good price on it and i received it fast !	1
1	i am really satisfied with the purchase of this camera good quality workmanship canon has been a leader in photography in my book easy to use controls for any one	1
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality and a good results in photos	1
1	i am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera i 've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots the winding mechanism is easy to use finally i have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember it 's even suited for kids over ten to use mine had lots of fun with their own quick snap	1
1	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1
1	it works as specified on my sony hdr hc3 hd camcorder i have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs distortions using this lens its a little pricey but well worth the money	1
1	i am a busy mom of two young children this camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments i love the fast cycle time i love that i can take multiple pictures in seconds would recommend to anyone	1
1	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1
1	i was n't sure if it would be worth spending the money on this case how wrong i was if you 're into diving and have one of these cameras buy it now	1
1	300 plus minutes of recording time \( without lcd \) i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery on the hdr fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time	1
1	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
1	good camera for the 129 i paid does everything pretty well and your picture modes are pretty customizable only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves loads pictures to the memory card might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways	1
1	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera i love this camera i think it takes awesome pictures	1
1	this thing is great i just got it for a trip to seattle from hawaii \( i know opposite \) but i was afraid when i had this default battery that came with my canon zr 500 \( which only last 45 min \) but this one last at least 3 hours i love it best buy for my camera so far completely worth the	1
1	it is rated for 5 meters but i took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop the antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour the microphone records sound well i have a high def cam and the s pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water in the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive and by experience i recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down even more snorkeling there are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole i would say a 14 18 onz it fine it is a great item	1
1	it is easy to mount and puts out a surprising amount of ligh	1
1	for its size and price this little light ca n't be beat very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors i think this is a must have for camcorder owners my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long term return	1
1	very easy to use menuing is extremely intuitive do n't forget to order spare disks 30 mins goes by quick	1
1	i got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures its also very sleek and small	1
1	started to by a less expensive bag last january \( dec now \) and i'm shure glad i did n't for the money this bag is a good one it 's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly the tripod holder on top has been real convenient	1
1	the camera fits perfectly the case is very stylish best of all its pink	1
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great unlike the century wide angle lens this is fully zoom through lens is 8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm also very little barrel distortion in all a great lens only drawback is that it 's a big \( heavy \) lens but then hey it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder	1
1	i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife on hikes i needed something that was not too heavy was image stabilized with telephoto power this camera meets all those requirements it does have one problem however in bright light the viewfinder blanks out so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed i have solved that problem to some extent by pointing the camera at the object and letting the autofocus do the rest this fix has resulted in many excellent photos like many other small cameras the results tend to be contrasty and i modify this tendency in photoshop	1
1	i love my new canon a710 large lcd makes taking pictures easy to frame color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 aa batteries is great i no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries i can go into any drug store only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb for a few bucks more put in at least a 1gig overall rating for a camera in this price range above average	1
1	for years now i have been buying bargain cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one finally i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex z600 this camera is awesome the screen is huge the picture quality is great it is easy to use and is sooo small overall a great buy the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock luckily i have an sd card reader so i normally just use that to download my pictures	1
1	the zr500 and other low end canon camcorders appear to be very fine products well worth their price but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur level home videos have a look at the rca small wonder simple rugged totally easy to learn and operate no frills but still some very neat features takes perfectly adequate videos of your children your dog whatever and about half the price bought one totally satisfied	1
1	this case was well thought out for snorkeling diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera definitely a better choice than using those throw away underwater cameras or renting one the only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720sw camera since size is one of its strongpoint	1
1	i 've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far kodaks treated me the best if your out to capture rich vibrant colors this is the film for you so far i 've shot 4 rolls of it and i'm amazed at how much the colors stand out its definatly the film i 'll be using	1
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why 's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one you ca n't go wrong with this camera highly recommended	1
1	very easy to install great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera would recommend to anybody	1
1	i bought this for my mother in law who is in her 80s and set it up for her it 's quite easy if you 're already computer literate and the controls are very user friendly as well the software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic but for someone like my mother in law it works well wish i had a docking station for my nikon	1
1	the philips 8 inch digital picture frame is an excellent high quality device very easy to get it going the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device no need to mess around with memory cards although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you everyone who has seen ours loves it it looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent	1
1	this is a fabulous gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable probably since the product is new do n't bypass their software to load the pix if you 're transferring from your pc to the frame their software reduces the memory needed for each one and even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time	1
1	excellent clarity even on cloudy days i have had others that cost 4 times the price and would not match the quality of these comes complete with with case caps and neck strap	1
1	i bought this item for a present and the person really liked it ! ! he uses it to watch deer and other animals the focus is very good and i am very happy that i bought this product !	1
1	looked at a number of cameras including the tz3 p5000 and a few others nothing compared to the g7 which is the one i ended up going with is 6x lens incredible quality etc if you want the best camera out there and do n't feel like messing with a dslr the canon g7 is in a league of it 's own the benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards	1
1	this is the perfect camera for me i take alot of close up detail shots and the images come out great it is smaller than my old g3 \( which i loved but was pretty chunky \)	1
1	i am a photographer and i am always running down my batteries i have n't found one so cheap as i did here thank you amazon	1
1	it lasts a lot of shots about 1000 shots it 's amazing with two of these batteries you have for almost a month in holiday without any recharge	1
1	excellent quality price speed of delivery works as expected would definately buy again from this vendor if the need ever arose	1
1	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
1	at 10mp this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures i have ever taken with a digital camera the clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera the display although pooh poohed by others as too small is quite large to me the cameras small lithe design is another selling point nothing bulky about this camera you can put it in your front pants pocket if you needed to do yourself a favor and get this camera you wo n't regret it	1
1	i purchased this camera primarily as a back up camera but i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera it is a beautiful piece of work	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
1	great little package ! small compact fits easily in your pocket took them to giants stadium to use from my end zone seat able to see action very clearly in the opposite end of the field easy focus for my bad eyes	1
1	i like this small thing work great and cheap	1
1	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy it has both point and shoot and slr features you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography the software was easy to use easy to set up and it works well on my mac it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name	1
1	with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic and i have great faith that they will keep it there reliable and more professional than a brick	1
1	this camera works well except that the shutter speed is a bit slow the image quality is decent the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient the camera is pretty sturdy i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine	1
1	outstanding service product as advertised excellent packing job arrived in record time would buy again from this seller	1
1	product is working good and clarity is fine but i found the next version product \( with remote \) cost lower than this product	1
1	just as advertised very small very useful great video great photos just what i neededthis is the second jvc camera i own and both satisfy my needs	1
1	nice and compact the tripod does n't really work as i expected i am using my own tripod overall is a nice little unit for the money	1
1	it 's a wonderful piece of equipment love it wish they made one for larger objects	1
1	we bought this bag for our panasonic pv gs400 video camera this bag is just the perfect size we can fit our pv gs400 tapes extra batteries recharger video cables remote control and even a small tripod has different comparments on top of functionality is done with a very high quality i highly recommend it just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy	1
1	i 've had it for several weeks now and it seems like a great camera i am still learning new features i would highly recommend it	1
1	this scope is one of the best gen 1 units on the market at 36 lines mm it has just about the best resolution most other units only have 24 lines mm the illuminator is bright \( almost too bright \) uniform and has a crisp edge it could be a bit larger however so that it would fill the field of view note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens \( to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification \) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof do n't bother with the ir flashlight it 's output is actually less than the built in illuminator and it is far from uniform	1
1	this camera was the best little camera i have ever owned it is so amazing it takes fantastic pictures and it is cheap	1
1	yes i am slow to make this review maybe because i spend a great deal of time using this camera the only thing i would like to have changed is a rechargable pack at first i burned thru many batteries i switched to rechargables and find that i still use a great deal of power \( i shoot often with the flash \) but now i can recharge the spent batteries after each session i use the charge of 12 aa 's in a 3 hour shoot i use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already	1
1	a really cool digital picture frame very simple to use and supports all types of memory cards even a pen drive	1
1	excellent product for the price pictures are not that good but you ca n't ask more for this price	1
1	this is the perfect case for my sony m2 camera ! yes i said sony m2 ! this camera case is perfect for it very sturdy and not expensive at all cool sony cybershot insignia on it and good d ring for your belt fits perfectly for my m2 and it has a very cool and stylish look to it ! 100 recommended to those who need a case for their m1 or m2 sony cybershot	1
1	with most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material this one is really different the rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera there is also a belt loop and d ring feature which is great	1
1	it 's easy to use and makes good pictures easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e mail	1
1	what a great little accessory for my camera could have used it in seattle last month boy did it rain	1
1	ok i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good	1
1	the battery is great and it 's pretty nice to own two of these so when one batteryis discharged i can just pop in the spare it was in stock and delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time	1
1	excelent battery ! i recommend it for all olympus slr digital cameras i am using it on my e300 and you can take a lot of pictures in one day i have 2 batteries because of outdoors shoots and this is really enough	1
1	i'm very happy with my camera i recomend it for anyone various funtions the sofware included is good as well	1
1	got this camera because a friend had a similar one the blue tooth feature is just great you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size all in all a great buy	1
1	kodak door strains to shut with this battery nice idea but too bad for kodak owners i have great success though with energizer lithium batteries they last me a long time and fit perfectly	1
1	i am totally satisfied with product features for me still it 's better than any available product from other company in this segment i ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often if i select album mode it still thinks to be in snapshot mode and vice versa it 's out of guarantee and i 'll hv to live with it anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like w50 or something like that	1
1	after owning and using the camera for a month or so now i am delighted with it i have only replaced the batteries one time so do n't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for small lightweight many features choice of 6 meg 5 4 3 2 and 1 meg photos at fingertips what i really decided on this camera for was the macro capability as i take photos of very small coins and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that it preforms magnificantly my previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle i love the samsung digimax s600	1
1	wow okay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size this is about half the size of an ipod mini it is by no means big read the dimesions well before you purchase the photos are really good quality and clear just small lol	1
1	you can check the photos that i took with canon s45 and this housing it works brilliant i just tested in 10meters also there are supported extra lenses for this housing \( macro wide \)	1
1	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me 1 \) the battery is the canon genuine nb 1lh battery \? 2 \) the camera case is canon psc 50 case \? thank you in advance	1
1	i needed an extra battery this whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone in addition to the battery you get a standard camera case \( retail 10 20 \) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras accessories and the portable canon printer there is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal	1
1	for those wishing to purchase this product and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens or to add special effects although not mentioned the size of the filter is 30mm \( not the 37 mm mentioned at other locations which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned \) remember 30 \( thirty \) mm	1
1	i have enjoyed using my camera i have been able to get some great pictures the stabilization feature work well	1
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1
1	it is a great camera very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances grainy pic in dim light go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car	1
1	product is excellent however when using in motion whether on bike or vehicle it is difficult to grip and falls off hand in addition the mode menu button is accidentally hit or depressed by your thumb while in motion	1
1	this digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up can be used by anyone in the selected mode i have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it i could easily see giving it already set up to people who are not computer savvy such as grandparents to give them new pictures send a new card and they slip that in that said the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision i would recommend this product	1
1	we got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it ! her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there is n't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film we were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them we were also aware of the battery problem so she got rechargeable batteries awesome little camcorder especially for the price	1
1	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible \( has a divider you can place where ever you want \) so you can secure cameras however you wish	1
1	i got this bag for under 15 and it is worth every penny it fits my canon zr850 and accessories it looks nice and it seems to be a great quality	1
1	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
1	if you are expecting clear professional sound transmission this is not it that 's a wireless system costing 1 000 3 000 this system is strictly for home none professional use i think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or tv soundtrack professionals do not use this system that is the reason for the low price home movies only	1
1	after 2 years the camera 's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge this replacement battery arrived promptly fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours i wish i had replaced the battery sooner instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power	1
1	this item worked allowed me to use printer and docking station from another kodak camera would do it agai	1
1	picked up a bushnell yardage pro 1000 laser rangefinder used online at another site for alittle less than half the new price works very good and was worth every penny i spent on it easily ranged objects and animals well past 800 yards	1
1	he adquirido este flash para completar mi c mara evolt e 500 y considero que es la combinaci n perfecta se requieren de conocimientos adicionales de iluminaci n y fotograf a para obtener las mayores prestaciones que ofrecen ambos equipos altamente recomendado	1
1	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it super easy to use good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket	1
1	seems to hold a charge just as well or better then the original one that came with the camer	1
1	the battery works as specified the pricing was excellent and the order came in very timely i'm completely satisfied with this product and vendor	1
1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery plus if an electrical outlet is convienent like when shooting inside you never have to worry about running out of power also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc ac converter but not as overall convienent as an extra battery i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery but it does n't nikon should add this feature in	1
1	very speedy delivery a gift for my daughter she loves it i thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not not really necessary did not know that still playing with it and having a blast i do like that it is weather resistant	1
1	an excellent purchase that lives up to the sony name my main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that i could point my mini camera straight down to take macro photos of documents it does this easily and the legs do n't get in the way it 's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case i need it and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it does n't get tangled up in anything else overall i would rate it as excellent	1
1	this case fits the z650 perfectly by just removing the inner piece	1
1	i purchased this camera case for the kodak z650 this case is perfect for the kodak z650 it looks and feels like a high quality camera case and does allow for the storage of an sd card or two i'm very happy with this purchase	1
1	picked mine up used on ebay for 180 with the growth of the vr market everyone is dumping there old lenses you can get a used one for a great price this lens is great for the serious amatuer i have taken some incredible pictures with this lens the autofocus is a little slow and i have heard people complain about softness on the high end but i have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my d70 at 300mm of course i shoot the photo on a tripod i have not experienced the softnes	1
1	these binoculars provide a good tool for night timesky viewing easier to carry than a telescope withthe advantage of using both eyes the tripod mountcan be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount the 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practicethey work great	1
1	i purchase this on december 2006 i have other 10x50 binocular but when i look at sky through this binox it 's amazing ! ! ! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip	1
1	the binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power the 70mm lens were great at light gathering and the 4 75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults can use \( the avg is 3 4 mm \) with a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use you really need a tripod to use the full power effectively but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly	1
1	if you take lots of photos rechargeable batteries are the way to go carry the other charged batteries with you in case you need to swap them out	1
1	bought these batteries charger just before going on an overseas trip i did n't want to be bothered with frequently changing aa batteries which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use i was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables they lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re charged in only a few hours a big bonus that i did n't expect the recharger is compatible with european 240 voltage so i did n't have to use an electric converter !	1
1	i had used some third party batteries with 15 minute charger that used to die for 10 photoes or so this canon one seems to realllly laaast looong	1
1	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
1	this is a great bag it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well i'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else	1
1	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	1
1	this is the only tripod that i have ever owned however i do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment especially for the very low price it suits my needs well for a small digital camera the only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag this was an oversight on my part when i ordered and i'm sure i would have to pay just as much as i did for the tripod to get a bag for it so i will live with it as is	1
1	the case is beautiful leather seems sturdy and well made would have been more functional if the belt holder was open ended i thought i ordered it for my son but found it very feminine when it arrived i had to give it to someone else	1
1	great camera only bad thing are the batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures and has some good features	1
1	of course it had to be kodak no matter what people say i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera i 've found this camera to be a real warrior last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better photo cuality its very good and colors are great no excesive blue or red in your pics night photo taking its excelent in close shots 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater but its nothing a 25 batterie charger can`t solve sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje	1
1	i had this camera for 6 months and so far there have been no problems the only flaw is that it dosent have a long battery time it takes good pictures and short videos	1
1	third camera from kodak easyshare great performance and pics slendor size	1
1	worked like a charm in my panasonic ag dv30 video camera ! having 5 hours of battery life really helps when you 're on vacation and do n't want to mess with charging batteries or being selective in your shooting this gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later worth the money and a good deal here	1
1	our firm uses our powershotsd500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing long battery life is very important we have over a dozen of the canon batteries pleased with them all	1
1	what i love about this case is its softness and its superior quality it fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it \( i have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras \) this one seems to be an improved model it does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera highly recommendable	1
1	your site was the only place where could find a replacement for my lost nikon uc e6usb cable for my nikon coolpix 3100 even nikon could not satisfy my request thank youcynthia valesi	1
1	i purchased this for my canons500 i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new good quality construction and a great look feel	1
1	this case fits the camera perfectly you hardly notice it when it 's attached to your belt	1
1	the leather is very soft and the case is simply quality i should have bought this one the first time	1
1	the case is protective and stylish without hindering the camera 's ability to store and transport easily it 's definately worth the dough to keep your nikon s1 or s2 from scratching or even breaking from a minor fall	1
1	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily	1
1	all i can say is if you know what you 're doing \( basic knowledge in digital photography \) you 'll love this camera adobe photoshop would be nice to have too if you like to play around with the pictures to make it more better have fun	1
1	this product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky a great safeguard from falls and the velcro latch provides just enough security	1
1	this was a great addition to the photography basket i made my grandson for easter	1
1	i got this for my mom when i got the digital frame for my husband it is very easy to download pictures on and she can show off all of her grandbabies this is an awsome gift for anyone the color and pictures are great	1
1	i bought this one as a cheap extra battery i have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery	1
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder \( sony hdr hc1 \) it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod	1
1	i bought this item to be used with my sony hdr hc3 camcorder in combination the fig rig it works as advertised i do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable but it can be worked around i found the remote to be very responsive as you would expect from sony and the price was a bargin	1
1	i purchased this kit primarily for the extra battery which retails for about what i paid for this item having the backup battery is great but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case it protects my dsc p200 without being bulky or heavy with the camera being so small it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money the case for the memory sticks is nice as well it is easy to lose a stick if it 's just floating around and the case keeps them securely all in all this is an excellent value	1
1	out of the box this is a simple to use camera the convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great i did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck just starting to use it so ca n't say much for now my wife loved it for its size and weight	1
1	this is a good padded case for your camera but the back pocket shown in the picture with a phone stick out was not deep enough for my phone with antenna attached it measure 4 x 3 5 but other than that i enjoy using this bag	1
1	i got this bag for a samsung digimax i got for a friend and is a very nice and usefull bag she can put there the camera her cell phone replacement batteries memory stick and some keys	1
1	my fuji e900 fits perfectly and also the battery charger and extra batteries the front pocket for additional memory cards is a great idea case goes on belt or on neck strap to accomodate personal taste very nice and reasonably priced	1
1	i really liked this cam bag it serves its purpose very well and is really cute too !	1
1	sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process this case is very slim compact well made and has a very luxurious feel to it it completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the sony camera it is designed to hold	1
1	this case is extremely stylish high grade leather with a very strong magnetic closure and a useful belt clip highly recommended for sony t10 and other camera models listed in description	1
1	very clear pictures very happy with this camera note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use	1
1	very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival	1
1	when i sow this in amazon and read the spec and everything on it i knew this is exactly what i'm looking for it 's portable handy and it 's easy to use the video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too you can even download mp3 music and use it to make music video or any music of your own here 's what you do output the audio to a power amp speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the mtv music video	1
1	it is exactly the same thing as came with my camera just what i neede	1
1	this battery recharger does its job well no bells or whistles just plug it in put the battery in and wait for the red light to turn green	1
1	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it this was the exact replica and it works great	1
1	i have a wall hung plasma tv with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side i was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation the hot pro ir target is very sensitive ! ! initially i had the hot pro box too close to another tv and the blue indicator light was always on if it 's glowing you need to move something once the indicator is n't lit but flashes when you use your remote it works flawlessly	1
1	for less 100 you can hide all your electronic equipment and still control it with the original remotes this product does everything it promises i recommend it with no reservations 110 satisfied ! ! ! !	1
1	the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus especially where there is not adequate light aside from this it is a good but not great lens it is probably worth the money that it cost however i believe that a better lens would be the 70 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens	1
1	isiklandirmanin iyi olmadigi yerlerde netlik sorunu oluyor birde floresan isik altinda beyaz dengesi tam tutmuyor diger ozellikleri gayet guzel bellek kartina cekim yapabiliyor olmasi cok guzel	1
1	i got this cam as a gift and it is very nice and sleek and easy to use ! the pictures are nice and it is light and easy to have it with youeverywhere	1
1	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little \( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards \) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation make sure to get a memory stick with it though because w o it it only holds about 15 pics this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again	1
1	this is something you will really need to keep you camcorder save and sound defenitely worth the money	1
1	great product great price great company quick delivery we love the small size	1
1	me encuentro muy conforme con el producto es de excelente calidad y muy buen precio amazon es para mi el mejor sitio para la compra de cualquier producto	1
1	you wo n't go wrong with a panasonic dv i 've had a few models i have several of this model for my business they 're rock solid reliable nice and small for portability and the quality of the recording is very goo	1
1	having just gone back to using a film camera from digital \( my wife still uses digital \) i have found this to be an excellant camera so far i have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect i would recommend it	1
1	i love this rangefinder much better than the type that shoots the prism on the flag sticks you can use this one to find yardage to bunkers creeks etc very accurate and very useful well worth the money	1
1	it is light has 6x magnification and easy to use this little tool is great for any golfer you must know the yardage before you can select the correct club how far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick \? next you just then need to pull the club that will get you there fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag these new laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models love it	1
1	i got a nikon laser rangefinder for chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification i found this to be to powerful for golf i could not hold it steady on the flag the 6x magnification on the bushnell yardage pro scout was much better also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart the price from amazon was well below i could find anywhere else	1
1	this is a neat idea you do have to have close up pictures to really be able to see them in the small screen it was very easy to load the pictures and it is very handy to have with me to show others our most recent pictures	1
1	received camera exactly as described easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again thank	1
1	solid construction good optics nice sound as mentioned by others the output for the usb transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself a minor annoyance all in all this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for	1
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality and a good results in photos	1
1	i am very pleased with this camera i especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure i am using this for my photo class and is easy to use	1
1	the d300 is easy to use it takes great video outside and is very good in low light it also takes very good pictures and the battery last a long time i would buy it again	1
1	this camera delivers excellent video quality i use it with the hot shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good i 've plugged this into my hd television and the quality is excellent i have also had the optura xi from canon and while the build quality of the hv20 is not quite as good as that of the optura xi the video quality is nothing short of stunning this is a very good deal for 1000 you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	this is the perfect gift for any occasion i bought one for my husband for his birthday and he took it to work next thing you know everyone was on here buying theirselves one it is a very easy thing to load pics on and hook up to your tv he sales cars and hes got his on his desk showing his family off and cars that they also have on the lot for the older people who are unable to withstand the heat so they sit right at his desk and check every car out on his digital frame i give this frame an a	1
1	got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well ! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance a word of caution ensure that the camera does n't get pressurized laterally this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it the spring operated shutter is very sensitive would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost effective and easy to use film camera	1
1	this is a nice bag but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag i ca n't even get the thing in the bag it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories good quality	1
1	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with 100pk 4 x 6 photo paper power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries and i still have room left i'm very pleased	1
1	its a cable it works what else do you want \? i know its not the cheapest one out there but this one says sony on it yea ! ! but i am a true believer that you only get what you pay for im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market who knows but i sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products	1
1	this is my second digital camera although it does so much more than my first it is much easier to operate i especially love the fact that i can video my grandson 's baseball game and then convert individule frames to photos \( jpeg \) with great quality i have a series of photos with him getting a hit it looks great ! thanks for a great product ralp	1
1	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with 100pk 4 x 6 photo paper power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries and i still have room left i'm very pleased	1
1	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased the pictures are wonderful the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem free we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do the slideshow feature is wonderful as well everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed to be sure they are expensive but worth the cost we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right	1
1	photos printed are very sharp some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are you ca n't afford to have much difficulty good for craft times with the kids	1
1	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
1	i purchased the videocamera thinking i could watch my old tapes also this videocam does not do that i had to return it	1
1	i bought this a year ago and have taken many great pictures with it it 's light has many features and can be used as an automatic when all you want to do is point and click i ca n't recommend it enough	1
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality and a good results in photos	1
1	i purchased this battery as a back up to the one that came with the camcorder the great thing about this is once charged it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power i discovered this last week when i wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but surprise surprise its recharge time is very fast the only negative part \( if i must have to give \) is it 's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder i say go for it	1
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes we purchased it for a cruise because we wanted to carry on the camcorder and have it protected but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	1
1	this is a very flexible and capable camera if you are looking for more than a point shoot will offer there are very few that would compare for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing the 16 9 is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4 3 i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16 9 feature the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside i am very satisfied	1
1	this tripod arrived on time and in good condition however i have to put the heavy duty in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well the weight you can put on it is limited however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer	1
1	order received in good time no problems battery lifetimes are short not as good as firstoriginal from dealer but twice as good as poorerchoice batteries from other suppliers	1
1	bought these binoculars for my husband he loves them they are very powerful and he loves the way they feel not too heavy he can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees	1
1	amazon is selling this at nearly 50 off ! the eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them the filters are really cool	1
1	this is a great camera the quality is good and the camera is very durable i 've accidently dropped the camera several times and it still works however i would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time	1
1	this case is so well made and just the right size to give the canon elura a nice snug paddeded cushioned fit plus secondary compartments for all the accessiories that you need to carry for your video photography	1
1	very clear bright day strong magnification quality seems to be good very well priced at around 100 00 i will know more over the passage of time my firstimpression is good mj schra	1
1	i am extremely happy with this purchase ! i love the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids	1
1	i bought this camera for myself at christmas it is my first digital camera purchase i love the clarity of the pics i love the shutter speed ! i do wish the lens cap would stay on better but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera	1
1	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field it does not appear on the lcd you can only see it through the viewfinder this is different from previous models minor annoyance the quality of the videos was surprisingly good but it saves them in the quicktime mov format mov is not my favorite format but perhaps others will not be bothered by this although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural i have found it to be excellent the overall quality of the pictures is good for the price i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers	1
1	the bushnell powerview 12x25 is a fine small pocket sized binocular since my wife is an avid bird watcher we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell that we used for trips so i researched then bought this one from amazon for her birthday she loves it the viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact which makes it easy to pack for vacations yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country we both highly recommend this and other bushnell products	1
1	small and compact let me see everyting i wanted to	1
1	i was using this lense for a week now with d50 and i can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is awesome at 1 8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi profesional \( like myself \) at 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in nef \( raw \) format and use photo editor software \( i use nikon 's capture nx \) photoes become master pieces at 22f outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person i highly recommend this lense	1
1	i was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice i love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do however the auto focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes i 've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster at least in low light	1
1	i was really happy with the telescope it was a good buy too i bought one for a friend als	1
1	i have no complaints i have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable fast and gives me crisp quality photos ! the only option i wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera \( especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments with high quality photos \) excellent camera overall !	1
1	the beauty of this charger is that it is 110 220v compatable so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors if you plan on traveling internationally this charger is a must !	1
1	i have been using kodak cameras for years this is my third kodak digital camera it does everything including taking excellent close up wildlifephotos it is as easy to use as a point and shoot however it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera it is well worth the money look no further this is the camera for you	1

1	love this digital camera compared to our previous ones we 're mostly a point and click family and this is an easy to use camera that does a good point and click and gives an opportunity to do more if you should so choose some day	1
1	i got this camera so i could have more control i'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings i have n't explored all the fancy settings much but there are tons of them i really like the continuous shooting option so i'm more likely to catch a good action shot the wide angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close ups i think it 's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos but do n't feel quite ready for an slr	1
1	good camera for the money picture quality excellent used camera on recent trio to florida for spring training and colors superb still learning the fine points and capabilties of the product dealing through amazon exceptional product arrived well within promised time frame no doubt a good deal	1
1	purchased as a gift and well received seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner runs everyday all day and no problems encountered displays vacation pictures clearly like that it is big enough to view across the room frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 model previously purchased	1
1	this is not a high tech digital frame it does n't play mp3 's it does n't come with a remote it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode there 's an on button and an off button there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame \( though it does come with a one page instruction sheet \) it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off if you want to display it in a difficult to reach location or choreograph your pictures with music then this is not the frame for you	1
1	this is a good battery and lasts for a long time good value	1
1	the battery is perfect and once in the camera is indistinguishable from the original	1
1	easy to get up and going we run a floral business and it allows us to take great pics for the website ! worth every penny	1
1	i decided i wanted this a while before i got it as i read reveiws i realized majority of them were postive there is nothing wrong with it the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera it can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on super sine mode where it uses the most megapixels it is definetly something i would recommend for anyone	1
1	the controls on this camera are not hard to figure out it is fun to haveall the little things you can do with the pictures and being 12 almost 13 photogerphy is somthing i love to do with this camera if you think thiscamera is to complicated well you didnt read the instruction guide very well	1

1	i purchased the axion 10 4 frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other more expensive frame the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues pros brightness controlcolor and contrast of displayease of setup and operationgood sound from speakers on music playbackcons slide show transitions are from top to bottom only different transitions would be a nice feature remote does not control volume of music overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages we have been very happy overall with this purchase	1
1	this is not a high tech digital frame it does n't play mp3 's it does n't come with a remote it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode there 's an on button and an off button there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame \( though it does come with a one page instruction sheet \) it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off if you want to display it in a difficult to reach location or choreograph your pictures with music then this is not the frame for you	1
1	i am pleased with the purchase very good value picture quality is good and it is easy to operate only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic however it looks good this is my second purchase of this product one for myself and one as a gift	1
1	is an product of great quality is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	1
1	i really wanted a 3ccd model but since i'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff like a tripod monopod media firewire adapter card camera bag etc this fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere yes the usb connection does work yes firewire does work although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version i was using not the fault of the camera	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
1	very well made once you are holding it you will feel the price was quite low for a product this solid and well designed	1
1	this item is cute my only complaint is that it really can only hold the camera there is no space for an extra card or battery it does however have a convenient belt clip on the back that you could also attach a shoulder strap to	1
1	i have had great luck with other opteka lenses but i had to by a thread adapter what is the thread size of this lens here \? i need to know before i buy opteka please put thread sizes of your lenses in the description thanks !	1
1	i am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price i add it and use it for landscapes mountain views nature images and such and also for group pictures in family photos it does what is supposed to do it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear and in this way the pictures appear more natural a whole view and not a narrow frame with perspective and deepness also quite similar it seems to me to what i see with my own eyes a very useful additional tool	1
1	i purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera this is my second point and shoot digital camera since i have abandoned film it is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures it has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me i have used it on an entire week long vacation without re charging it kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less	1
1	i purchased this camera for my son he is a doctoral student and needed to photograph items for his research he was able to learn to use it quickly the battery life is phenomenal	1
1	bought as a gift for daughter in law she loves it seems to be an excellant entry level camcorder enough bells and whistles to satisfy most without being excessively expensive quality is good which is to be expected from jvc operation is simple enough and picture quality even for jpeg internet quality stills is satisfactory	1
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel 71 of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 \( as of today \) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with 5 megapixels i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
1	i love this camera i have now traveled all over the usa some places in europe and will be using it in china lens is excellent i wish it were lighter weight but ca n't have everything and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else	1
1	i am very satisfied with this purchase it is exactly what i wanted i purchased 5 more as business gifts for important clients	1
1	i bought this for my husband for christmas i researched a lot of frames for reviews picture quality size of picture ease of loading it with pictures and overall look this frame is excellent and my husband really cherishes it	1
1	it was n't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the samples on the frame was no picnic either but once learned it becomes easier i went from frustrated to happy soon enough	1
1	this is a great easy to use camera i have had this camera for a year and it has seen alot of use the only drawback i have had with this camera is that it eats aa batteries i bought rechargeable aa 's and they seem to last forever ! problem solved i am about to purchase a second one for my son for christmas great camera	1
1	i really enjoy this camera mine has the carl zeiss vario tessar lens it works grewat be sure to use the memory stick pro media a great reasonable priced camera	1
1	i bought this camera in august it is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate i think it takes really good pictures inside and outside who cares about video quality \? its a camera not a camcorder lady i think it is a really nice camera its really durable too and it looks nice i would buy it again i researched a bunch of cameras before this one and i chose the sony in the end its one step up from just taking everyday pictures they look really pro i 'd buy it again	1
1	i really enjoy this small high quality camara i purchased a 2 0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage of the 7 1 mega pixel and i get great pix everytime i have lots of fun with it since its so small it 's easy to take everywhere with me i also get lots of compliments on it 's fashionable sleek design i highly recomend his camera	1
1	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas	1
1	high iso and large screen were the reasons for my purchase the screen is great but when you force the iso 1600 it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800 i have a s5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an iso is set w o having to go to full manual option definitely something to improve ! the auto option seems to work much better and i was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works also the two picture function \( it takes two with slightly different sets automatically \) saves me on a lot of 're posing	1
1	i was very pleased to find an 8 mega pixel camera at such a reasonable price ease of use and easy to use softwate for editing	1
1	the camera fits perfectly the case is very stylish best of all its pink	1
1	excellent ! they have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables	1
1	i 've seen this item for no less than 7 00 elsewhere so i got a good deal	1
1	my bother in law and i went to africa on safari last year we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well	1
1	i have the white one \( black was unavailable at the time of purchase \) 1 the camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet it is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle 2 durable no scrapes or scratches in 7 months 3 have n't missed the belt clip option its small enough to fit in my pocket4 well constructed durable people think its some sort of ipod case holder	1
1	i bought this camera for my teenage son the only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short other than that it is a good camera the slim design is nice and the camera is loaded with features	1
1	i agree with many of the reviewers in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb but it is not quite as sharp as a tele as one of the reviewers said it does many things and not all of them perfectly the lens is a compromise but an excellent compromise the vr is an added boost i'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back because of the weakness in the tele but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility i do n't want to keep changing lenses	1
1	pros compact and complete this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop \( gray blue \) i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well construction quality is good \( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs \) sturdy enough for its intended purpose i like the output of the lights seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight cons only one complaint the output of the lights could be stronger requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture	1
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	1
1	i was a little skeptical on this product because of the cheap price and the lack of reviews but it is just what it says it is and i am really happy with my purchase i would definitely buy this again	1
1	i bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it ! definitely a good buy	1
1	the picture viewer is a fun way to carry lots of digital pictures in a small device however setting it up and loading it was a nightmare i spent hours writing to tech support and ultimately on the phone to figure out how to move the pictures from my computer to the device	1
1	the best buy in the marketplace it easily fits into my suitcase for travel the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is	1
1	this is my 5th digital camera it is the best i have used in this size camera	1
1	i bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it the pics are bright and clear and the camera is very easy to handle	1
1	camera has good features and decent battery life for a regular camera for those of you who do n't need a special camera and just want something that can take decent pictures this is a good one i like it	1
1	i got this camera for my birthday present in january and i'm extremely satisfied i'm very new to the entire photography world however this camera makes it easy to get into the camera is smaller than i expected however it takes great pictures i use it often for pictures while we are on trips the picture quality is great however screen quality is n't up to par with other brands this is a great value and i really like it my only complaint is that the easyshare software is bad it 's slow outdated and does n't work well overall i recommend getting a 1 gb sd card i have 3 of them	1
1	this 10 20mm lens is equivalent to a 15 30mm in a 35mm film camera so it 's an ultra wide lens at 10mm i was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens and it 's rectilinear which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph it is a well made lens made with high grade materials what this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes close quarters interior photography and in architectural photography where you do n't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces personally that 's what i like so i'm very happy with this sigma 10 20mm	1
1	not only is this beauty wide i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d200 ! it is built solid and focus 's fast and i do n't have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly ! buy this lens it is cheap for what you get	1
1	i have been shooting away for the last few weeks the olympus 720 is a gem i must have filled up my card 3 4 times so far being new to the digital camera era i am finding that it is not as hard as i thought it would be shoot pop the card into the card reader copy to computer upload to walmart 's photo service and i have my prints mailed to my house in a few days i am happy that everything was included with the kit i would have never known what i needed and it basically has everything covered	1
1	this is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with d200s the camera loves batteries having two is good ! having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there 's another on standbye is a fine feeling knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better ! for a full day of shooting you need this and some serious memory highly recommended also handles aas always good in field conditions	1
1	this took my d 200 to the final level great investment went 2to 3 days while on vacation while shooting 4 gigs a day of stuff love this little guy plus it allows for aa usage in a pinch gotta love that	1
1	i just bought this for about 190 at the local px i am impressed so far i was going to buy the gs180 but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up so far the low light is much better than a single ccd the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe i look froward to using this camcorder a lot	1
1	i bought this rangefinder for golf it is small enough that i could keep it in my pocket it really helps me with the approach shots to the greens it takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag i usually use a person on the green as my target after i got an approximate read i use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag be careful with the tiny battery cover it came loose and i lost it on the golf course fortunately i recovered it amongst the green grass the cover is also green i now put a tape over it to secure the cover	1
1	this rangefinder is great ! much lighter than the big bulky other units has all the great features that is needed this is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it 's too big i tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy great scan mode best buy should be sold for about \( \) more than asked for	1
1	took some nice pictures underwater in cuba pretty easy to use worked fine at our depth \( 8 meters 24 feet \) still waiting for the chance to use it at greater depths	1
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	1
1	the changer performs perfectly i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original about one foot shorter other than that it is fine i gave my original changer to my daughter whose charger died just before leaving the country	1
1	the charger really did what it was supposed to do i have an li 10b so i was still some what worried that it was n't going to do the job but it did i also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere	1
1	thes item is gretes item i used befoer for these prise ! ! yes is true is very clear optics you can see in total darknes about 350 m it 's agood rand price and qulity	1
1	this item was purchased for casio exilim 8 megapixel camera the quality of this item is strong and durable the camera is small any ways to take with you anywhere by putting it in your pocket however to protect the camera this case provides outstanding protection and is still small and compact to take it with you anywhere	1
1	i bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it it has all the basic functions her older coolpix had abut more and they 're a bit more user friendly pros compact and easy to hold i 've had a few other point and shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand this one feels pretty good cons before buying i read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be i will agree that is the cameras only real big down fall though my girlfriend may not notice it so much to me it 's a little more aparant for the most part overall i really like this little guy	1
1	easy to use produce pretty good quality it takes pretty long to process between the shots so you wo n't be able to take quick continuous shots but for the price it is pretty good valu	1
1	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	1
1	great tripod we 're using it in a television studio w sony vx 2000 cameras they work great	1
1	while not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases this one is a must for anyone owning a hdr hc1 or other compatable camcorder operating the camera from the tripod \( rather than the touch screen \) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer the unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation the only drawback is the soft storage bag which does n't provide adequate head protection	1
1	handy item for price not a great telescope but a very useful tool to look at roof shingles broken tree limbs bird 's nests etc must be stable but can be carried in a pocket weighs very little and is very clear very good deal	1
1	the lenes work on the factory lens only with no feature to add additional lens it works as advertized i would have like to add the wide tell lens to the filter for better out door videoing	1
1	i have n't used it much but the few photos i have taken are excellent i'm not a photography expert so i 'll leave the technicalities to others telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount the high quality of this lens as with the wide angle is obvious comes with caps and a storage bag	1
1	was pleased to receive the kodak schneider kreuznach xenar 1 4x 55mm telephoto lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants i do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the kodak p712 the kodak p712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures by adding the kodak schneider kreuznach xenar 1 4x 55mm telephoto lens to the p712 it makes already great pictures even better and what clarity i recommend this product to everyone !	1
1	the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are 2 9 x4 2 x1 8 \( wxhxd \) it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
1	i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz 7 the lz 7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode pros takes great pictures optical image stabilization 6x zoom and great price it is also made in japan not china as the nikon l5 is cons fixed zoom while in movie mode no on board camera speakers	1
1	fall through spring i always carry my r817 in coat pocket when i go out this jacket fits my camera like a glove allows access to all controls and lcd display through clear heavy duty plastic film once flap is opened open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera only time i zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery otherwise i just leave jacket on camera at all times	1
1	the lens adaptor threads on very easily and i 've not seen any loss in color or light from using this filter	1
1	thank you for showing me i will use it as many times when it comes into my mailbox soon	1
1	the seller was super fast the product well packaged and as described thank you	1
1	i had a previous generic charger that did not work well if you go with this one you wo n't have to worry about that this one works like a charm and seems to charge pretty fast too i 've had this for a while now and never had any problems with it	1
1	this camara picture quality is nice and depend on user purpose my gf is kinda satify with it function is easy to use battery life is so so battery charger design is not convenience you have the put the battery into the batter charger recommand to get a cradle charger but extra cost it should sell with cradle charger	1
1	i have had this camera for about six months and i still find new features to play with one of my favorite mode is the sequence shots i love its sleek design and its durable shell i carry the camera in my back pocket even in my tightest jeans this is a great camera	1
1	i think is a must for any beginner for a low price you can have almost all the different size of ep try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the ep that you need	1
1	i love this battery charger ! i used to use store bought aa batteries for my olympus digital camera but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week the batteries were drained of power for some reason this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if i am just storing my camera highly recommended	1
1	this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus	1
1	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased at this time i have not gone under water with it	1
1	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	1
1	i did a lot of research before buying the pv gs250 now that i have the camera in my hands i know i made a great choice great image quality great build quality the low light problems you read about are not really a big deal in a noramlly lit room everything is fine	1
1	very easy to use multiple languages something nice and easy for even unexperienced users recommend to anybody buy it it 's worth it and the price is right for the features and mp i would not hesitate to pay more for this camera kodak has done wonderful job with this on	1
1	the compact power adapter for camcorder that we had ordered was in excellent condition and as described thank	1
1	the camcorder compact power adapter workedvery well i was given great help in finding theright one for my canon camcorder which in itselfwas amazing 5 stars to the product and to the helperswho helped me locate the right one	1
1	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
1	this product is good for its price the mini tripod inside the switchgrip looks very good and holds my canon pro perfectly the travel bag is also very useful	1
1	i have received this camera for serveral weeks it 's a good long zoom digital camera i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized the picture is sharp image quality is good however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 when the iso is 400 or above i can see the noise and the picture lose detail but every camera has its own defect overall i am satified with this camera and i am enjoying using it to take pictures	1
1	this battery for my cannon camera is a great little back up battery my camera came with a cannon battery and charging unit the replacement cannon battery sells for over 40 00 so purchasing this cta battery at less than 10 00 is a very good choice	1
1	i bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter it was her \( and ours \) first digital camera i read so many reviews prior to selecting this model the reviews for this camera were so helpful this camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures rechargeable batteries are definitely a must ! this camera is the best camera for this price no doubt about it we have taken still shots and videos it is so fun to have the option to take a video we have some great clips all i can say is we are so happy with the camera we would definitely choose it again	1
1	this camera is an exelent camara it has plenty of effects plenty of modes plenty of scenery options the image quality is 3 2 megapixel but its quite good the pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury where as if you take it with the flash it comes out exelent and sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash and sometimes it happens imediatly but all these flaws are only with my version but if you are looking for a good camera with a great price this is your best option	1
1	because of it 's non intrusive red lighting and especially because of its size and brightness control this is the perfect little light to bring out in to the field for observing one caution make sure you have the lanyard securely around your wrist especially if you 're shining the light down a tube to collimate one slip and it 'll be headed toward your primary	1
1	i was very happy with the product it serves me well fast delivery good service by the vender i got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future great travel storage case heavy plastic unit good quality light stands	1
1	this fugifilm padded soft case is strong durable and very attractive it was more than i expected it is very professional looking	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
1	the product was easy to use and accurate it is also a great buy	1
1	i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon so far the lens has performed as expected it is solid and well built sticks slightly when zooming through 200mm images are crisp and focus is sharp working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick overall good lens for 200 if you have more money then a lens with image stabilization \( is \) would be the way to go	1
1	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	1
1	this is a great product i wish i had not waited so long to purchase it you must be aware that it only works with l type batteries i though that it would work with p or m types which is what i have for 2 sony camcorders i had to then purchase an l battery \( np f970 \) my old camcorder that uses p batteries is able to charge l batteries as well do your homework with the batteries	1
1	i 've been using this directional mic for almost three years and have never noticed camera noise it 's compact and provides a good reach for most ambient sound situations	1
1	i purchased this prior to the birth of my son and it 's doing the job perfectly i do n't have a 2 4ghz phone at home so i ca n't say how it would 've affected its performance but video and sound are very clear at a remote location i'm happy with the product and highly recommend it	1
1	i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex s500 that was sadly stolen from me it 's the same size which i love and as convenient which is awesome it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken it 's one of my favorite things ever	1
1	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf 10 when this case was on back order it was terrrible so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased the camera fits perfectly into the case and although it is described as a soft case it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk	1
1	this lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it the fact is the fz7 and the fz30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15 or so bigger than without it if i can i 'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens the camera i have is a fz7 because i want as large an image as possible of my focus i am very happy	1
1	i have sticked with sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago and sony camera has been the moneys worth ! this one dsc t10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change it fits in my purse and still have space for more the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery \( for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere \) you need that one when you do n't thing you need an extra battery you always run out at the wrong time i recommend this one	1
1	my family goes swimming quiet a bit i got the sports pack to take pictures of the kids underwater in the pool this is a big hit it works extremely well i also highly recommend the sony dsc t9 camera it 's great for trips it 's so small you can put it in your pocket and the pics look great	1
1	i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it rather than having to use one or the other	1
1	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
1	due to a canoe accident on vacation mine went completely underwater for at least 5 10 seconds but only a trickle of water got inside once that dried out much to my surprise both the af and vr functions worked fine all that 's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens \( okavango delta water is clean ! \) do n't try this at home next time i'm even near a canoe i 'll have everything in dry bags	1
1	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1 40 my d50 flies on it	1
1	this digital camera is awesome i have no problem with the batteries i made sure i put the good batteries in \( no cheap ones \) i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march awesome digital camera you wo n't be sorry on this purchase	1
1	this is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball as far as i can tell if you follow the directions and are as close to the action as possible and at a straight on angle it looks like its correct in the 1 mph statement however this is a cool gadget but if you are serious about speed and would like more versatility then your going to have to go with the official mlb jugs gun but at a much higher price good luck	1
1	this is a nice lightweight tripod from sony stable and well built i have used it with both still and video cameras without any problems it would be nice if it came with a travel bag of some sort	1
1	bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights with the crank make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope no matter how tall they are compact and lite to carry makes it easy to transport to and from the range	1
1	this film seems a lot better than kodak max 400 even though it is basically the same thing \( except for the fact that it 's black and white \) i would n't recommend this for proffesionals but it 's great for the average person	1
1	for the price you get a lot out of this camera 6x zoom stabilized the images comes out great at full zoom \( 2 stabilization mode \) the aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture the multiple program modes just about lets you take a great picture under different situation ! controls are easy to use and get to in all definitely a great buy for the price the down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the dmc lz5 or a camcorder	1
1	easy to learn takes very good photos in well lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments its low light capabilities are n't that great very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera a bit slow to recharge from a flash though and there 's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken \( not so great for fast action shots even though it touts a sports mode \) it 's a good beginner 's camera a good pocket style camera but certainly not to be mistaken for a high end unit	1
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	1
1	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed the white box is for general use also available are the green omni bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni bounce for a warming effect pros inexpensive solution for better flash photography a quality product that works cons non	1
1	i really enjoy my photosmart r725 it 's small easy portable takes wonderful photos and is very versatile in terms of settings i just have one thing i do n't like about it and that 's the fact that there is no viewfinder there is an lcd screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder but it 's hard to see in bright sunlight and i'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use for now it 's great but i'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run at the same time it 's not spendy so it might be worth it	1
1	i bought two one for me one for my daughter it is compact user friendly it has nice sized screen it comes with a charger \( i 've been told that some do n't \) 6 2 mgp video with audio all this for a very nice price	1
1	i recently purchased this camera and i'm loving it as a whole it 's very easy to use and carry i'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time	1
1	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price	1
1	outstanding camera in every respect i 've owned several digital cameras in recent years \( sony nikon \) the n2 's giant 3 lcd the touch screen features lens optics and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras i use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly good job sony	1
1	everything was excellent the digital camera the delivery thank you a lot ! ! ! !	1
1	great seller ! shipping was very fast ! this battery out does the oem one that came with the camera very happy ! thank	1
1	i bought this flash to use on a light pole with a flash trigger when we shoot weddings rather than use one of my canon 580 's i thought this was a better use of my since i use this additional light in manual mode anyway it does the job for under 10	1
1	for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times this flash solves the problem i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience items were sent quickly	1
1	very clear pictures very happy with this camera note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use	1
1	i have had mine for over a year i love this camera ! it is so easy to use takes great pictures is very easy to use and program etc i love everything about this camera ps unlike the other poster i have not had any battery problems at all	1
1	though being a nikonist for years and knowing the possibilities of that camera i could never imagine the results and performance of this item easy to handle incredible small for the capacity and giving the same options to get the same quality of pictures than the d80 i have both	1
1	i bought this camera around the beginning of july and have used it several times already i 've upgrade from a nikon coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller sleaker size and more megapixels this camera takes excellent pictures in broad daylight as well as in the dark red eye reduction is wonderful however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times it 's not broken it 's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch overall i think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation !	1
1	it was time to upgrade my 2 0 mp canon powershot s200 which is more than three years old \( ancient in a digital world \) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures the newer canon cameras had a larger screen but it was basically the same camera after a month i am still pleased that i purchased the nikon coolpix s6 push button to switch between camera versus play modes \( versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails \) easy to navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an ipod no telescopic lens no annoying zoom sound during focus on off less wear and tear on the most vulnerable component	1
1	this is a quality bag for the price it is a little small and tight for the nikon coolpix 8700	1
1	i absolutely love this camera i got it about 3 months ago and i cnt imagine life w o it im 13 nd mega clumsy nd it still has not one single scratch on it it eats up batteries but so wat \? i love it buy it	1
1	i purchased the pentax k10d digital slr about four weeks ago and am very happy with this camera and the two lenses 18 55mm and 50 200mm with the shake reduction and anti dust features you can`t go wrong if you went with canon or nikon you would pay through the nose for their lenses the construction is very solid with seals that help prevent dust and water entering the camera the features of the k10d make it a joy to use i would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital slr i am age 81 so it`s never too late to move up the ladder w c rhyn	1
1	the housing worked great took it to 80ft scuba diving and with the flash on the colors came out ok no leaks and access to all functions a plus	1
1	the enclosure has a solid feel to it i dove with it three times with no problem at all it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure	1
1	the case with battery and filter is well worth thr price paid	1
1	not too hard and not too soft camera fits nicely with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
1	awesome compact camera that takes remarkably sharp pics very easy to use touchscreen and \( my favorite \) reliable stabilization feature	1
1	this is a camera that is very very easy to use i was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light i took a movie at my nephew 's theater play and i am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect the zoom is also very clear and crisp putting it onto my imovie was also a piece of cake the only down point is that the still image mode is worthless but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot i highly recommend this camer	1
1	excellent camcorder the only thing i would do different is spend the little more it would take to go up to the pv gs85	1
1	i bought this for my mother she loves it ! its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view the print quality is excellent i got more \( merchandise and quality \) with this hp brand than i would had with any other brand the price was excellent too good job hewlett packard for making me a smart person	1
1	i 've purchased other bags but this one beats all it was a great price to	1
1	for years now i have been buying bargain cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one finally i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex z600 this camera is awesome the screen is huge the picture quality is great it is easy to use and is sooo small overall a great buy the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock luckily i have an sd card reader so i normally just use that to download my pictures	1
1	good product probably the best digital frame in the market drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set up the wireless connection	1
1	i bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the galapagos it worked perfectly and i obtained some really incredible shots both still and video the combination of the canon sd550 and this housing were amazing i did make sure to lubricate the primary o ring each time i opened the housing but the need to do so was reduced by using a larger 1gb memory card both card and battery would last a little over two dives before i need to change one or the other	1
1	i'm a long time canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade i can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera the pictures are fuzzy take a look at one of the newer canons with image stabilization and i think you 'll be happier	1
1	i dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and wo n't close after some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place i finally was able to close the lens besides that it is an awesome camera i am able to pick out a color \( ex red \) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white no photoshop needed	1
1	kodak v705 black small can carry in pocket wide angle lens great for group photos fast start up time video mode is easy built in mic picks up all the sounds camera can stitch 3 photos together great for vistas i am happy with this camera bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it kodak makes easy to take photos weak flash try not to be more than 6 8 feet away or use photoshop on photos	1
1	i bought a spare battery for my d70s and charged it up one time since then i have been waiting to use my spare but the original \( charged hundreds of pictures ago \) has been going strong for literally months follow the directions do n't use it until your fully charge and do n't recharge until it 's run down this will help maintain battery life good product from a great company	1
1	the remote control works well with the olympus digital camera it was deliveredon time and without any problems	1
1	this accessory is very useful when taking group pictures with the photographer included	1
1	this is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun with no real investment although it does go beyond 17 feet and that is not as far as you may think but i used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet	1
1	like others i have compared it in a scuba diving trip to the kodak max sport and this one had a few advantages 1 film winded at greater depth 2 the pictures came out clearer not grainy and with better colors do n't expect too much of it at depths below 8 meters since light wo n't be enough \( i used it on a bright summer day in the red sea \) even at shallower depths colors turn blue green without use of flash i have taken it down to depth of 35 meters and the camera was fine but would n't take pictures at depths below 20 meters the pictures i took at shallow depth came out excellent	1
1	the best binoculars i have owned and i have had many excellent clarity great field of view too nice size also not to big not to small you cant go wrong with this fine set highly recommended	1
1	goo	1
1	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry based on my trial use of the vx2000 that was three years ago this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production plus i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves	1
1	this camera is the best point and shoot cameras for the money just think of what you are getting not just a 7 2mp camera but a lica lens and technology not a bad deal the images are not bad when printed on a scale of 0 10 10 beining the best i give this camera an 8 david the photogin chicago	1
1	the nikon s3 has proven to be a good buy it is affordable yet takes a quality photo in addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket this camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction my only complaint is as a result of the user if the camera does not have time to focus then the picture quality suffers immensely this camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet ! my rating 9 10	1
1	i am a female bowhunter who really had trouble judjing distances on green fields this is a great product it is easy to use and very accurate	1
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards i bought it for future use as i do n't currently have the lens yet but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too	1
1	i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends i have used the older cx 7300 \( very similar camera \) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me less to break the c530 is more compact has better resolution and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die if you want simple digital snapshots you will love this little camera	1
1	for an all purpose color film i nearly always shoot fuji 's 200 speed it has the cooler tones that i prefer in my images and a good saturation level the only drawback that i 've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over priced ! the only place that i 've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less and you wo n't have to wait for it to ship	1
1	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 it 's perfect and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast i received it within a few days	1
1	i use this film just normally for everyday stuff it is n't grainy when you enlarge the photos and the colors are just outstanding i use the 800 for the really important stuff though because i think the colors are more vibrant but for just vacations stuff around the house the 400 will do a great job anything less it basically a waste of money i shoot at least a roll a week just of everyday life and this is the one that i choose all the time i have a basket full	1
1	this film has great color production and performance the price is also just right you ca n't go wrong with the fujifilm superia x tra 400	1
1	do n't believe the marketing kodak does i was using only kodakfilms for nearly 5 years i recently switched to fuji based on some online reviews i was pleasantly surprised at the results i highly recommend this film	1
1	i am in love with this camera the shutterspeed is awesome the quality of pictures is awesome and the shake reduction feature is awesome ! ! i would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera !	1
1	my printer fits perfectly with plenty of room for the paper tray extra paper and a few other things that i have managed to get in also i love this bag thank	1
1	nice portable background support kit stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution easy and quick to put up i put it up by myself with very little effort all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting	1
1	after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month it has met my expectations and perhaps then some after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150 ish range i partially regret spending what i did it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth bottom line no complaints with it	1
1	i bought a canon powershot a70 they say your best camera is the one you use most and man i use it i'm a high schooler so i dont have much money but with the a70 i can attach this adapter \( la dc52c \) to my camera and i can have more photographic freedom with lenses for alot less money you have to have this adapter first then any lense which fits \( most \) can be used good idea canon ! ! !	1
1	i so love the size and shape of this camera this one takes some good pictures and appear to be quite clear it 's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone this camera may seem like it 's taken a poor quality image but when you transfer them onto a pc they seem so clear ! however it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory as this camera was a gift to me i 'd have to say it was the best birthday present i have received	1
1	yes this is a very good first camcorder i am a first time user of any cam corder i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting but the software is harder to use that movie maker but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic enjoy do	1
1	multi element add on lense used with kodak dx 7590 provides good wide angle capability note that this is a very large add on lense \( screws into dx 7590 extension piece which costs an additional 20 \) does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications however two caveats \( 1 \) slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide angle shots \( ie corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus \) suggest cropping to 95 of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane \( 2 \) size of lense will render pop up flash and outside the lense focusing system \( ultra sonic \) less functional	1
1	great little camera case has a main pocket for the camera and a second smaller pocket to hold batteries and memory stick it 's well made ballistic nylon very durable attaches to belt or sholder strap	1
1	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony it works great had no problems so far it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv	1
1	just like any other minidv tape good pric	1
1	this camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a must the price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores so i look at it as getting the case for free !	1
1	so far i really love this camera it 's very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a very basic mode or normal mode what attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality it has a large viewing area which is nice and it 's very clear i recommend this camera	1
1	i 've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best i think i shots very quick flash is brighty and even soft flash for more natural shots can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera is light tiny and slim one of the best cameras i do n't find a negative feature on it i love it	1
1	i received this product in a timely manner it was exactly what i needed thank you	1
1	we use our batteries a lot no problems works as advertised	1
1	if you are looking for a good small camera and have no intentions of being ansel adams this is a good camera choice i travel alot and this camera is perfect because it can fit in my pockets or a small purse it also takes pretty good pictures	1
1	this is a great camera it 's so thin and takes amazing pictures even when the subject is moving the best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind of lighting great quality i suggest this to anyone	1
1	some reviewers below have said that this microphone does n't work with the sony hot shoe wrong click on the technical details on this page and you 'll see the sony camcorder models that this microphone works with failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer not any fault with the microphone ! so do n't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product please	1
1	for 14 00 you should get this sleek little package to protect your camera and battery accessories if you 've ever accidentally dropped an expensive camera you know just what i'm talking about it 's nice looking as well	1
1	this camera case is great it 's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly there is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries \( but the batteries make it tight \) i originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600 but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you are n't careful this camera case does not come with a strap like the other but that is something i would never use i highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera	1
1	i bought this product almost a month ago its sleek its reliable and has all good features a good digital camera should worth the money for a sony camera this camera has the usualy seen high quality for a sony product	1
1	this camera was a great investment the photos turn out wonderfully better than a regular film camera and i have kept an eye out on simular cameras price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price the only problem i have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras have that problem this is a great camera	1
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected and was just what i wanted very small but versitle large screen very satified with my purchase	1
1	considering the price this camera works great i use it for taking family pics and is wonderful what i dont like is the lack of zoomgreat product anyway	1
1	celestron 's tool is easy to carry easy to use and \( at least in my case ! \) gives me quick precision collimation with my newtonian why pay for a laser collimator \( which needs to be calibrated \) when you can use this \? collimation is the most important part of your setup without good mirror alignment all you 'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights this combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless and also fairly fast highly recommended for any level of observer	1
1	the new olympus stylus 770sw is the nicest camera to date i 've purchased it takes great pictures and is extremely durable the picture quality is awesome in all types of weather conditions and lighting i stronly suggest to purchase this if the price is right	1
1	very good camera this was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera she picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger takes some getting used to zoom lense works great and takes good pictures where the on off button is so close to the shutter you have to be careful that you do n't accidentally shut the camera off she is very satisfied with it	1
1	after setting booby traps for zombies i like to whip out my bushnell waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in this scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof it is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail ! !	1
1	this spotting scope from bushnell is an excellent buy if you are an outdoors person or if you like watching the world from your window you can even view the craters on the moon plus it 's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod the amazon price is the best deal on the internet	1
1	i'm not a professional but this lens makes me feel like one it is a very versatile lens working well inside or out low light or extremely bright am looking forward to taking sporting pictures next spring	1
1	i liked this lens i used it for the first time while traveling through peru it was light weight and easy to use at 200mm most of my pictures turned out great especially when i was on steady ground \( taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge ! \) i 've printed some 8x10 's of close ups i took using this lens and i was quite impressed with the quality it was also in my price range overall i 'd say it was a good bang for the buck	1
1	i deal in major brand cameras and panasonic cameras are my personal favorite ! i 've seen people whine about the noise they make many times but have never found it to be a problem i own the fz10 and the fx01 for my personal cameras the fx01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics ! i love the 28mm wide lens compared to most cameras i 've used the fx01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images i love panasonic 's solid build and reliability they may not be as popular as canon or sony but in my opinion are every bit as good	1
1	the casio exilim ex s770rd is a great camera for the price camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket lcd sreen is large and very clear 7 2 mp produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed as this is my first casio purchase i am very pleased with the quality	1
1	i have own this camcorder for 6 monthit 's a good camcorder esay to use easy to bringas it 's design purpose pc 55 is enough for home useonly one thing i want to mention here before i buy this camcorder i thought that i can record video on ms duo in mepg format and it 's easy for post edit on pc you know tansfer a minidv tape to computer may need a huge space to save however when i replay the video which stored on ms the sreen was full of mosaicfortunately when use dv type to record this situation never happens good quality the one press photo button also becomes useless because the bad quality	1
1	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great except for the touch screen feature that takes a little getting used to especially when accessing the special features \( such as fader effects \) while filming the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer all in all it is a good product just takes some getting used to	1
1	great camera one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack but beware this camera does not come with a lens cap and no remote control other sources state that this camera does not have a leica lens this camera does not have a v input no flash no hot accessory shoe \( though it has one which has no power \) no widescreen lcd it does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen	1
1	this is my first camcorder so i do n't have much to compare it to but i 've enjoyed it so far it 's easy to use the picture quality seems high the only minor problem i 've found is with the headphone input had to try three different sets of headphones before i could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is	1
1	getting great pictures from this new flash for my sony digital slr camera	1
1	the flash works very well i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash it works great i am very happy with this product	1
1	a great add on for the xacti hd1 but two minor problems i 've found so far 1 i ca n't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and 2 flash photography wo n't work as the pop up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add on lens	1
1	i ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did i have a stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade an extra battery and an extra picture card there are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover in the main compartment a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money \( it wo n't fit much more than that though \) it 's compact stylish and functional i'm glad i bought it	1
1	very small and easy to carry neat on the zoom a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck	1
1	love my new jvc everio the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files \( mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio \) i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2 0 which supports this new file type natively it has made editing a breeze	1
1	i went the \( thinking it was cheaper \) ebay route for about 10 more i got a new one here and it works ebay is nice but when it comes to stuff like this i learned my lesson i 've never gone wrong ordering from amazon in fact i just ordered an oem nb 3l battery for my sd500 tried the radio slop route and it wo n't go over 20 pictures again shame on me for trying to go cheap	1
1	i have looked everywhere for this charger everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera it 's just the right size and plugs right into the wall the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry on bag thanks so much for having this item available	1
1	good camera for the 129 i paid does everything pretty well and your picture modes are pretty customizable only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves loads pictures to the memory card might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways	1
1	i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it first of all is 's very easy to operate with the joystick the use in the still image function is allways available even while shooting a video \( nice feature but as all camcorders low quality pitures \) the stabalizer \( one of the reason why i 'd preffered that cam over the other \) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos the large zoom \( x32 \) is also very nice overall i think this is great value for my money	1
1	after much research i finally found the binoculars that fit my every need the price was right the delivery was right on schedule and the product is excellent	1
1	loved this ! it is awesome because it is both land and sea camera so you need just one ! you can get tons of accessories and flashes for it it is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections including making your photos more in focus in case you shot them blurry ! i cannot wait to use it again well underwater for diving i mean	1
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1
1	it 's great nice top storage for memory cards and extra battery compact perfect for camera size	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1

0	this small package of noodles came to me in a huge box which i thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary and when i opened the box a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold so they were hot and smelled terrible i had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell and called gristedes and left an upset yet polite message it has been almost a week and i have not heard from them do n't waste your money on this supposedly great deal it 's not worth it	2
0	this was the most disgusting diet product i 've tried i love marshmallow dip and this was n't even close to tasting like it it has a chemical taste like you 're eating spun plastic and makes you actually scared to eat it why even bother eating it i 'll stick with fat free whipped topping at least it has flavor	2
0	i like some of the other walden farms products i gave their chocolate dip 4 stars but this one is not very good i tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it tried it in combination with the chocolate dip and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away the cellulose gel walden farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy sour bite to it it does n't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings but here it ruins the flavor	2

0	i was on a search to find a great oolong tea this set contained one somewhat weak black tea two green teas and a very strong jasmine i much prefer black teas so tried one cup of each and then gave these away perhaps if you have a more exotic tea taste this would be a better choice for you than it was for me so far the very inexpensive bigelow oolong has come closest to a true oolong black cup of tea	2
0	fine cut diamond texture whatever it 's missing the thing vital to really be popcorn salt and that is the flavor that true popcorn salt has slightly buttery very strong and always good there s a trend lately to re lable regular salt as popcorn salt this trend needs to stop	2

0	i used to give omaha steaks as gifts thinking i'm giving a good gift recently i ordered these for myself and was embarassed these steaks are yummy but are tiny do n't let the pictures fool you they are small to begin with after cooking are laughably tiny add the cost for the expensive shipping and handling i could have done much better at my local butcher supermarket save your money	2
0	the photo shows four containers each 9oz the product is actually only one 9oz container very misleading possibly intentionally so also shipping costs 10 for a 9 product \? give me a break ! on top of it all the chocolate is nothing special you can get 16oz containers of ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for 10 which tastes better	2
0	24 teabags is n't even enough for one pot perhaps my tastes run contrary to the mainstream but i like my tea very strong	2
0	this tea is very bitter it is very aromatic it does smell nice and exotic but it was just too much for my simple tastebuds	2
0	this was a bomb it was guilt inducing because i had to throw it away i got two of them like an idiot	2
0	we were really looking forward to having some omaha steaks again unfortunately every steak had grissle and was very tuff the flavor was not what we remebered either they were very bland i could have gotten a better steak at the supermarket and saved myself alot of money	2
0	i proceeded to open the container then pour it all over myself in front of my girlfriend imagine my embarassment with poweder all over myself needless to say the evening did not go as planned though i did take a bath and the water did taste an awfully lot like milk my fault though for thinking the company was nido powde	2
0	i think coffee taste is more of a personal preference but i was not fond of this decaf coffee i always drink my coffee black and i did n't get the rich coffee taste that i like with the don francisco brand illy has a great reputation so i am guessing their non decaf coffee is outstanding they just need a little work with the decaf	2

0	i love the popcorn but the shipping costs are insane ! ! a total rip off wabash valley farms or amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind 5 stars for the popcorn minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping argh yes the popcorn is tender and luscious and it melts in your mouth like you 're eating cooked grasshoppers but come on ! ! ! ca n't you ship this product for less \? shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse sigh too bad really	2
0	i ca n't believe that this is considered a gourmet food in the uk long life uht milk is an excellent standby when you run out of fresh milk and it tastes much better than this parmalat ok brands differ and taste is a matter of preference and there are mixed opinions as to whether the uk uht milk tastes as good as pasturised but many are just as happy with it as fresh there is no way that the parmalat could be mistaken for fresh milk and how expensive just add gourmet to the title and up the price ! in the uk it is similar or cheaper than fresh milk i ca n't understand why it is not more available in the usa	2
0	i expected parmalat brand milk but received a different brand altogether i also excpected this to have a long shelf life not just a few months i thought the product was overpriced for what i received	2

0	omaha does n't grade their meat consequently you do n't know if you are purchasing prime choice select or worse and from what we have sampled i doubt that it is any better then select and maybe not that as we 've had some skunked steaks	2
0	i really prefer the shoumei green tea which is one of the only green teas i can find that is n't bitter the white tea does n't have any sweetness to it and is n't much fun to drink i only drink it because it 's good for me	2
0	i was thoroughly disappointed with the product they were not all that tender and certainly not worth what i paid for the produc	2
0	these steaks dribble like a basketball and shoot like a dream they should include a backboard rim and net with these and some cheerleaders would n't hurt either	2
0	paying 25 for shipping and handeling was a bit much	2
0	frankly it was a bit grapey would n't dare try stuffing it into any orifice probably too fragile	2
0	i thought that i would try out this product since i 've tried a number of green teas and after trying this i was not at all impressed with it by any means i do n't recommend this product there was no kind of flavor to this to me and i 've been all over the orients just my opinion but hope someone else enjoys it better than i did	2
0	i thought my fresh vine ripe tomatoes would come whole instead as you can see from the graphic i received five whole tomatoes and one that had already been cut in half yes half a tomato the half tomato in my package had dripped on the other ones and made quite a mess in fact the resulting tomato juice ate a hole through the box they arrived in making a puddle on the floor that was small but big enough to trip the ups guy he fell and fractured his spine and now he 's paralyzed his wife and nine children are destitute all thanks to these vine ripened tomatoes in conclusion i think this packaging is just a bad idea	2
0	so really how important is this fruit err vegetable err fruit \? i mean i like salsa and a hamburger just would not be the same without catsup err ketchup come to think of it spaghetti would not be the same either but eating these things plain is just silly the taste is not so bad but the consistency is all messed up in conclusion if you must have some tomato in your diet please purchase tomato related products and not the tomato itself and why the heck is n't it spelled tomatoe \? why is the e added for the plural form \? what gives	2
0	i have mixed feelings about tomatoes one time a tomato ate both of my parents on the other hand they can be made into apple pies in conclusion i am a tomato	2
0	i find tomatoes to be overrated they 're an important ingredient in many things obviously but as an item themselves they 're of limited use they taste alright but their texture is too screwed up the only time i ever really eat raw tomatoes is on hamburgers and sandwiches and usually prefer not to have them as they destablilize the whole sandwich so that it all falls apart obnoxious that is	2
0	thought it would make a cute easter gift no one else thought so kids are in counselling now apparently i'm the only one with a sense of humor in this family at least it 's a hit with the dog one extra star for that i'm way too scared to even try to take it away from him he loves it so much 'heh ok sirfluffles ' i say to him 'it 's your fresh whole rabbit '	2

0	listen up i'm a big boned gal who has yo yoed in weight over the years thankfully i'm currently on a downswing and i hope it stays that way which brings me to hostess twinkies which are very overrated this is one of my least favorite hostess snacks if you want the truth the sponge cake is stinky	2
0	twinkies were once great but once they sold out to the big corporation the quality went down the drain it 's too artificial tasting to be considered food there are a ton of chemicals and additives added you call this cake	2
0	come on this is 2005 twinkies are n't food anymore than cheez whiz is twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while i'm just as guilty of that but eating twinkies is practically self mutilation look at the ingredients list and do some reading yikes ! everyone 's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too sorry hostess that definitely does not include twinkies	2
0	i placed an order for these beans on march 4th on the 14th march i did not receive them as yet since the occasion that i needed them for has passed i sent an email to jr to find out the problem when he said they were not shipped as yet i send 2 e mails requesting cancellation i sent 2 to make sure they got it and stopped the mailing of my item ! he responded very hastily as used sarcastic comments in his reply the tone of his reply made me feel as if i did not know anything ! ! i am very disappointed with this whole ordeal !	2
0	where does it say does not include spices \? i was under the impression that the traditional spice box would come with the traditional spices very disappointed even thought the stainless steel container is nice	2
0	these are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless juiceless and unburgerlike in texture completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket i will never buy omaha steak products again omaha steaks' customer representatives are very nice however i wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said i could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card thank you very much	2
0	years ago these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor the most recent shipment i had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture not recommended	2
0	these were good burgers but i did not find anything special about them i could go to the supermarket near my house and get some ground beef and make my own for a lot less money and they would taste just as good these are good but not worth the extra money	2
0	i usually love hot pockets but tried this two weeks ago terrile ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i was going to rate it o stars they taste terrible the packaging is deceiving there is too much cheese with sprinkles of sausage and egg nasty ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2

0	why does n't amazon allow people to sell used lettuce \? i bought to kill a mockingbird used last week via amazon and saved about 90 off the original price i do n't think it 's fair that they are not allowing us to sell it used via paypal	2
0	i'm very disappointed with this gift basket the contents that i received were far less than as pictured and described in the web page the price of 85 90 is very expensive for this item and definitely not worth it i ordered 4 items from wine country gift baskets totalling over 230 and had to return all items due to unsatisfactory products contents i spent almost 30 in shipping charges which they refused to reimburse me i would never order or recommend wine country gift basket to anyone	2
0	these used to be the best sardines before bumble bee bought king oscar 16 24 delectable brisling sardines in excellent olive oil could n't find better now instead of the advertised small 16 24 brislings you will find 8 11 large bony and un appetizing sardines crap	2

0	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2
0	i use a variety of sugar free products including others by wisconsin cheeseman how they missed so badly on this product amazes me normally i like the items from thier list but this fudge sent me into a severe bout of bathroom time after eating 2 small pieces do n't know if it was a batch with the ingredient mix off but once was enough to have me tossing the rest of the package in the trash no way would i recommend this for anyone try the cherry cordials or the peanut butter cups but leave this off your list	2
0	okay i just got my ups delivery 1 \) these are half the size of a real donut 2 \) dry overpriced and just terrible3 \) no flavor and horrible presentation4 \) totally overpriced and not worth the moneyi recently bought the low fat donuts recommended in the oct issue of every day with rachael ray holey donuts ultra low fat gourmet donuts and these low fat donuts are full size packed and shipped in a frozen cooler and oh my god they have real cinnamon buns that have 3 grams of fat double the size and yes they cost more but everything arrives frozen thaws soft and moist and just blows this way	2
0	this was disappointing someone should define light roast or standardize the roasting process	2
0	at first glance the price sounds reasonable but wait until you peel these things strip off the peel and there 's another one peel that off and there 's another one underneath i removed the third one and you guessed it another one beneath that frustrated i kept peeling and peeling and finally right at the center was this tiny little sliver after peeling the whole bag i was left with only about an ounce of this pungent vegetable talk about a ripoff	2

0	beware this is a spice mixture only not actual harissanot what i intended to order but the ad was n't clear harissa as i ate it in north africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices some oil fantastic stuff i recommend mustapha 's moroccan harissa it was terrific	2
0	creme filling i suppose they taste alright if you can prevent them from falling apart all over the floor you cannot prevent them from falling apart all over the floor they are unbelievably dry	2

0	amazon 's site made no mention of the products not being in stock charged my cc and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered my first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else and my second call \( upon not receiving a return call \) revealed the real facts having a credit card charged for items not in stock is not cool beware	2
0	how can the vendor justify this kind of pricing \? it must be all shipping do yourself a favor go out of your house and hunt for hot sauces while it would be too simple to say they 're all the same there 's definitely not a lot of difference within the same manufacturer i 'd get this for a gift for someone but for myself i 'd rather enjoy the hunt	2
0	i have liked other hot pockets like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but i think they over spiced the pizza hot pockets they taste kind of strong and weird	2
0	i am a huge fan of most of the tasty bite meals i 'd tried almost all of the indian flavors and had never been let down i ordered the green curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance unfortuantly i found it to be nearly inedible the rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just wrong i love thai green curry and this tasted nothing like it i still recommend the indian tasy bite meals but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6	2
0	do n't order a case of these if you 've never had them i love all the other haribo gummies i 've had \( bears cokes burgers etc \) but found these weird and did n't enjoy them i'm probably just not used to crunchy things on my gummies but i gave the rest of the case away	2
0	i really like these and was excited i found them online although after receiving them they were to stale and hard to eat	2
0	this carafe was initially perfect the design is attractive and simple and it fits well in my bag in the mornings the problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute i attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning although i felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up i 'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether	2

0	i know that american milk has been suffering from quality issues for the past few decades many american milks are catching up in initial quality and now have better warranties than foreign milks yes union wages and pensions have driven up the cost of american milk but hey we 're talking about cows jobs here people ! buy american !	2
0	i love salmon and was very excited about having salmon jerky to keep at the office and take camping and skiing until i got my order and found out that both flavors contain msg which gives some people \( like me \) whopping headaches my wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture and our dogs love it but i wo n't be trying it to be fair you might like this product if you are n't sensitive to msg but the seller should have noted that it contains a modern ingredient that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being made the old fashioned way on the plus side shipping was very quick	2
0	i must admit the first one that i ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked however the second one was much less cooked and when i went to cut it blood from the sausage squirted into my eye now i am beside myself because i remembered my wife going on one night about blood borne diseases i am scared that i might have unwittingly acquired hepatitus or aids my wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases i refuse to take any chances because my wife and i are having problems i still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered	2
0	these are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless juiceless and unburgerlike in texture completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket i will never buy omaha steak products again omaha steaks' customer representatives are very nice however i wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said i could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card thank you very much	2
0	years ago these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor the most recent shipment i had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture not recommended	2
0	these were good burgers but i did not find anything special about them i could go to the supermarket near my house and get some ground beef and make my own for a lot less money and they would taste just as good these are good but not worth the extra money	2
0	we do not like this product my whole family thinks it tastes awful granted we 've never used flavored popcorn salt of any brand before we all agree that we prefer plain salt on our popcorn and if we want butter we melt butter this product just taste like chemicals	2
0	i got a bad batch and was sent another to try out it was better but still not what i expected on both the pieces were very small for some reason i was looking for some like the ones in mres which are excellent these may be ok for cooking but not what i wanted this company 's customer service is top notch though	2
0	purchased as a gift to client the gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was but one of the cups was chipped they could not find the chipped piece so we do n't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival i'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but i would choose another company to handle the gift baskets will not use them again	2
0	i ordered this item on december 13 but it 's not deilivered yet as of jan 3 horrible shipping ! ! !	2
0	i ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy there is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good you are probably used to jelly bellies but these are not jelly bellies there flavor is medium at best i would not buy this product again	2
0	i just purchased this product from a high end specialty gift shop for 6 00 it was the exact same item	2

0	i just paid 15 dollars \( after shipping \) for this cheap looking plastic popcorn bowl that was supposed to be a gift for my sister bah humbug ! ! ! did i mention it is plastic it's plastic ! ! ! !	2
0	these are definitely not my thing the chocolate and toffee flavor is way too strong if i 'd have wanted hot cocoa i would have ordered it ! however if you 're a big fan of gas station cappuccinos these may appeal to you	2
0	very weak in fact it was the last hope i had for my machine which i am selling next week in a yard sale it was the color of tea very bad	2
0	i thought that i would try out this product since i 've tried a number of green teas and after trying this i was not at all impressed with it by any means i do n't recommend this product there was no kind of flavor to this to me and i 've been all over the orients just my opinion but hope someone else enjoys it better than i did	2
0	omaha does n't grade their meat consequently you do n't know if you are purchasing prime choice select or worse and from what we have sampled i doubt that it is any better then select and maybe not that as we 've had some skunked steaks	2
0	echoing other reviews performance is not consistant one time we did get excellent coffee this morning it jammed the senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re open it considering the price of these pods even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product	2
0	i have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency i have wasted two very expensive pods so far the first time i used a kona pod the machine jammed and i could not open it for 24 hours \( caused a steam lock \) about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo the next time i tried a kona pod i got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try i am not very impressed so far i am now afraid to try again	2
0	imagine giving a fairly expensive gift and no one knows you gave it that 's what happened with this one completed the order wrote a nice note and the note never arrived maybe i should be greatful they actually sent the product omaha steaks is off my vendor list	2
0	these steaks are terrific but let me tell you buddy these people are never going to stop phoning you once you have bought anything from them they repeatedly ask whether you enjoyed your order and then drop a pitch for you to buy more from them and they never stop calling back sometimes as often as twice a week they 'll call wanting to sell you more and this goes on for months and months and months consider yourself duly informed	2
0	i would like to buy one of these products from wine country gift baskets but i cannot find a description of what is actually in each one	2
0	but just add a little spenda and cream and it is mmm mmm good i can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that i drink this tea also i have n't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu this year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and i have been exposed to all of it but knock on wood i 've been the healthiest one in the family and at work \( and the only one drinking this stuff \) so go figure \? there are too many things good about this tea to not try it	2
0	i agree completely with the previous reviewer this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality ofharibo candy this stuff is dry and hard and it leaves your hands sticky with waxy grease and the flavor what little there is is just weird kind of a fake floral not recommended	2
0	i bought these because i love haribo gummy products however i was disappointed to see that they are made by haribo france i e not really german haribo and believe me there is a huge difference these ones are very very greasy not soft and have almost no strawberry flavor do n't waste your money	2
0	these steaks are only distantly related to real prime rib they are tasteless \( other than being overly salted \) have a texture reminiscent of congealed soy protein and look even worse omaha steaks are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to mail order meats do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	2
0	i was very disappointed at quality of this steak it lacked any flavor taste or texture omaha steak should review this item	2
0	the prime rib slices i had were pre cooked and they are terrible nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home they lack in both flavor and texture the remaining slices i have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos	2
0	we have used kona coffee pods for about a year they were excellent we found it more convenient to order through amazon as the shipment arrived more quickly with this last shipment the coffee often was watery even though the coffee unit was functioning well it was hard to know what to do with these various boxes of coffee from from a remote supplier	2
0	received the package to discover a warning on the label that the product may contain wheat there is no allergy warning on amazon apparently if you are allergic you have to order the product to find out that you cannot eat it	2
0	since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics this should not be recommended it has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1 2 cup of cooked pasta this is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal only 1 2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal who can eat just one cup of pasta \? it is very misleading to diabetics as digestible carbs has no meaning to them total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic thus diabetics beware if you want to eat it remember 1 2 cup is a complete meal of carbs	2
0	thought i 'd try this tea wrong choice tea is not as good as numi 's iron goddess of mercy oolong tea perhaps my favorite oolong shipping costs almost as much as the tea on the natural chinese wuyi oolong i 'll stay with numi tea from now on	2
0	i did n't care for this pumpkin soup it taste more like pumpkin flavored corn starch	2
0	this tastes more like a chemist 's concoction than peas paneer if this is somebody 's first acquaintance with indian cuisine they would avoid indian cuisine for the rest of their life	2
0	rice paper crumbles off possible due to product being very old or improperly stored disappointing	2
0	it reminded me of when i got mud in my mouth while playing diggers in the garden as a child ! sorry but this was n't for me i'm affaid the water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy'	2
0	i have been drinking green tea for years and love not only the taste but the smell too when i opened up the box of this tea i thought i was standing over an old ash tray ! it 's smells horrid and does n't infuse well into the water i steeped a table spoon of it for five minutes and the water color barely changed i highly recommend you not buy this tea exotic product aside the plain old lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better	2
0	check out the shipping cost ! if you buy 1 bag it's 6 50 just to ship it to you so that's a total of nearly 10 bucks ! i suggest you go to a health food store and buy it and get it for much much cheaper	2
0	when i ordered this mre item i expected it to be preciselythe same and equal to government dictated real mre 's being utilized by the u s military this is not the case this product is sopakco's version of whatever they choose to produce distribute i find this false and misleading advertising and can only imagine the millions of suckers like me who have beencaught up in this trickery i expected the real thing and received a fake very disgusted feel very used nuts !	2
0	these can be had for 59 69 a case elsewhere shop around this vendor is overpriced	2
0	i was shopping the internet for this product and the price asked here is the highest i found ! the sopakco mres are the real deal for easy high quality emergency food supplies but you can get them for a much better price elsewhere	2
0	hey i know a way you can get these practically free of charge yeah you guessed it join the service ! but really mre 's may have come a long way from the civil war days of hard tack but they still have a long way to go before i 'd actually want to eat them over a conventionally cooked meal i guess it 's good for emergencies though or to act like a soldier on a camping trip	2
0	i waited and waited for an order from jd foods to come for a xmas gift even received a notice that the order was placed and correct only to find out through my own efforts that the product was discontinued bad communication will not make that mistake again	2

0	i like marshmallows i like them plain in hot cocoa and i like them toasted and as a fan of jelly beans i tasted this toasted marshmallow flavored jelly bean from jelly belly and i did n't like this flavor at all i personally did n't think it really tasted all that much like toasted marshmallows and was just kind of weird tasting	2

0	i ordered this to give as a gift i rec 'd the package opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing haribo had mislabled the box and what i rec 'd was 5 lbs of sugar coated gummy apples instead i was very diappointed although amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount i hesitate to order this item again	2
0	it 's unfortunate that all imported thai teas seem to have artificial food coloring and it was a nice idea for thai kitchen to try and come up with an all natural analog however this tastes nothing like real thai tea they need to take this one back to the test kitchen	2
0	i picked up a 1 oz tin of same brand for 14 99 in dallas are	2
0	i'm giving only one star because this item costs more to ship than to buy ! ! ! was charged 5 75 for shipping this is a total rip off dean deluca should reconsider using a more economical shipping method i hope this product is worth five stars taste wise	2
0	i have received no emails from anasuper no tracking number and extensive delivery estimate i do not know if i should cancel order i am trying to give them a chance to show me their wares i can understand if this product has special preparation time but i have recieved not one communication nor confirmation no product information	2
0	i 'll admit it the first three or so cheetos actually taste pretty good however each one seems to taste worse for some reason and then there 's the despicable cheeto dust you get that stuff on your fingers and you 're forced to either wipe it on something \( gross \) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers \( gross \) i detest snacks with sticky dust crap this stuff is the worst offender	2
0	kashmir spinach is the third tasty bite offering i have tried the look and taste is quite unappealing we would not consider buying it again we had high hopes based on how much we loved other tasty bite items we tried but no luck with this one i encourage you to try agra peas or jaipur vegetables instead two tasty bite items that are really fantastic	2
0	this has the overwhelming acidic taste that is characteristic of canned spinach that frozen and fresh do n't have if you know what i'm talking about and like that taste then this is ok but for us it 's inedible	2
0	the description says thick and creamy try watery and icky just trying the figure out what to do with the other 3 cans spent alot hoping to find rice pudding like kraft and thank you very disappointed	2
0	well i guess i'm the fly in this reviewer ointment but dave 's is the only hotsauce that i wo n't buy it has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non existent this is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers it offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion according to wikipedia its scoville heat \( fire \) index rates out 50 000 units which can be contrasted with tobasco 's 2 500 to 5 000 rating who needs that much heat \? not me or most human beings this stuff is lethal no thanks	2
0	i ordered what i thought was matcha tea powder a comment on the page said it was slightly sweetened no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal serving and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils not what i was expecting from a green tea powder would not recommend	2
0	the sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant i thought it was not fresh tasting the picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only other marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit i am glad that i only bought the small size since i ended up throwing this purchase in the trash	2
0	half of the product came with mold growing on it the other half tasted so artifical that we just threw it out	2
0	regardless of the even heating advertisement this pan is a very thin carbon steel and produces very uneven heating even using low medium heat it rusted even after seasoning before the first use got one use out of it	2

0	i expected something better from godiva chocolatier i am a big fan of both chocolates and coffe butgodiva seems to be making coffee that tastes like somethingin between vanilla and chocolate i could endure chocolate creme and vanilla hazelnut butthis creme brulee coffee is just awful godiva has to focus on their chocolates true coffee lovers connoisseurs will hate this coffee	2
0	i was very displeased when i received the feuilles de brick i had to cater for an important client all the ingredients ready to be assembled in the feuilles and due to their dryness \( the feuilles de brick \) i could not bake my desserts	2
0	i ordered a few boxes of this and i could n't stomach this the spices were very off in this type of dish to the point where it made it could n't stand the taste of it it had way too much cinnamon i ended up throwning my other boxes out i would recommend kohinoor brand over this any day	2
0	this product is overpriced i found 11 oz bags of this at the local grocery store for 3 49 which is 31 7 cents oz this gives 12 22 for the 38 5 oz bag featured here and there ordinarily would be a further discount for buying it in a larger size bag the candy is good but it seems better to look for it in your local store	2
0	took way too long to be delivered i wanted it before christmas and did n't get it over two weeks to delive	2
0	i thought i would be receiving bread but i thought wrong rocks i received rocks and there is no softening them up either nor do they contain any ham just hard rocks	2

0	these are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless juiceless and unburgerlike in texture completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket i will never buy omaha steak products again omaha steaks' customer representatives are very nice however i wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said i could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card thank you very much	2
0	years ago these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor the most recent shipment i had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture not recommended	2
0	these were good burgers but i did not find anything special about them i could go to the supermarket near my house and get some ground beef and make my own for a lot less money and they would taste just as good these are good but not worth the extra money	2
0	this is delicious but packed with msg which is very bad for you take care	2
0	while the product is what i wanted the shipping was too late the original shipping indicated that i should have received my pepper in time but the shipper got the product to ups late therefore i did n't get to use the pepper in the recipe and now i 'll have to wait for another time to use it	2
0	when mixed as directed had a weak chai taste and no color would not buy agai	2
0	these donuts were much heavier than typical donuts and sat at the bottom of my stomach also the cream was a bit tasteless	2
0	i placed an order for these beans on march 4th on the 14th march i did not receive them as yet since the occasion that i needed them for has passed i sent an email to jr to find out the problem when he said they were not shipped as yet i send 2 e mails requesting cancellation i sent 2 to make sure they got it and stopped the mailing of my item ! he responded very hastily as used sarcastic comments in his reply the tone of his reply made me feel as if i did not know anything ! ! i am very disappointed with this whole ordeal !	2
0	this cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste the dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter we do n't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either the chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa tasted strange there are many non gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand we wo n't buy this cocoa again this gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets but the cocoa fails the taste test	2
0	as i said above the vanilla you 'll get is artificial it 's vanillin not the way more expensive vanilla being advertised personally i do n't care for vanillin because it tastes harsh and chemical laden to me this stuff tastes no different than the fake vanilla at the supermarket and i did n't have to trouble my poor mailman into delivering it	2
0	the product that i received is partly vanillin an artificial vanilla i expected to get pure mexican vanilla naturally i was disappointed	2
0	these were just awful ! we tried to give them away but after one taste not one person liked them i wish i could explain the flavor so anyone reading this could decide but there is nothing to describe it we ended up throwing them out	2
0	this is what happens when starbucks destroys a good brand to elevate its lousy brand this blend is undrinkable save your money and buy a supermarket brand	2

0	not very exciting cake part actually tasted a bit stale they just did n't seem very special sorta like commercial snake cakes at 50 cents a cake bite not worth it at least they were pretty	2
0	did n't like this product at all nothing like the popcorn salt of my youth ! thought it would bring back fond memories alas it created bad memories and left a nasty taste in my mouth ! ! ! oh well the search continues	2
0	when i purchased the candy bar i thought i was i was buying the real cadbury from england but to my mistake it turned out to be the same candy i can buy in any store can you belive i had it shiped to my house	2
0	i am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping the product costs 29 95 and shipping is 22 49 doubling the cost ! this is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater i worked in during high school i adore it	2
0	when i received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up one of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when i pulled it out of the mailing box on top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale ! ill never order anything from this company again ! ! ! my entire 11 00 went down the tubes what a waste ! ! !	2
0	beware the cadbury from netgrocer 's is not the creamy uk cadbury it the hershey cadbury from the us the difference between the two is like the difference between a miller and a fresh guiness	2
0	paying 25 for shipping and handeling was a bit much	2
0	i could n't believe the price for these berries and they 're a third of the size they should be i 'll stick to buying mine from the local asian foods grocery at 3 25 a pound	2
0	fun idea really really fun idea however i gave each of my teenagers \( 11 14 \) a reindeer jelly bean candy pooper it was some task for the kids \( and the rest of the family \) to get the dam things out of the packaging w o breaking them the first one lost it 's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package woof ! the second one stay together long enough to see the new year tip use a razor blade and be careful of the legs	2
1	this italian gift basket captures the feeling of italy at it best when you send this to family or friends they will definitly feel the love and warmth of italy and is sure to please 5 star recommended	2
1	i have been suffering from nausea for about six months now and have tried it all i decided to order your chews and some crystalized ginger and it works i finally figured out it was my gallbladder and soon i will be nauseous free but thank goodness for my ginger chews	2
1	this has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor without managing to be overwhelming i cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach that being said whatever ends up getting you interested in this product whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish desk etc my only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly	2
1	yummy green tea pocky ! ! ! ! ! just make sure you purchase this in the fall winter months otherwise it 'll melt in the mail i would 've given this 5 stars had the pocky not melted together into a lump	2

1	obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot ! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope ! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass	2
1	the service from igourmet is impeccableeverything arrived in perfect condition i e ripe \( and therefore stinky just like it should be ! ! \) the styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery the cheese arrived alive from not being over chilled i have not had cheese of this quality outside france and this is the first time i have found perfect cheese in the us if you like top quality stinky cheese this is for you	2
1	when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better it is more slender with richer chocolate it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much very balanced if you love chocolate this is definitly better worth trying	2
1	as it say so astutely on box of glowing color this yum yum pocky is for men only it not good or happy for womens to consume do not dare to ask why for that journey will not be pleasant only accept and then you will see the joys of pocky this pocky for men get other pocky for womens then two can be most happiness in joy of whirlwinds	2

1	yes ! yes ! yes ! this marshmallow cream is amazing i'm diabetic with an enormous sweet tooth and this stuff is a g dsend sooo yummy and sweet without that weird cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel just marshmallow goodness i'm sure as other reviewers have suggested it has many uses maybe i 'll discover some of them with my next batch the first batch got eaten plain it was that good \( i am thinking of bringing it camping so that when the rest of the family has their s'mores around the campfire i can make a little tin foil packet of my own with this chocolate and graham crackers and rest it in the coals how good would that be \? !	2
1	i have to say growing up my marshmallow cream always came out of a jar so half way through the jar you 'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky now with this tub with a wide mouth my hands are n't sticky plus because it has no carbs or sugar i can eat more straight then i ever could without having to worry as much either	2
1	if you have to avoid sugar and miss marshmallow life is good again this marshmallow is delicious has the perfect consistency and lasts and lasts hot chocolate fluffer butter sandwiches home made sugar free rocky road ice cream you can have it all now ! ! ! plus the people at a bountiful harvest are wonderful	2

1	when i got my gummi bears they were kinda stuck together and kinda hard but it 's still good	2
1	i ca n't stop eating these babie ! they 're good companion for watching a movie at home do n't forget to bring some to the office	2
1	i can hardly express in words how i feel about these bears haribo gold bears are absolutely charming they 're a little taste of heaven i like them frozen	2
1	i am a huge black licorice fan however i do n't think i 'd really experienced black licorice until i had panda black licorice great intense licorice flavoring extremely addictive if i open up a box i find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty ! delicious	2
1	i followed the package instructions and these noodles turned out great ! they do have a different texture than carb noodles they are firmer and more slick but these noodles taste great ! they are more than worth the 2 in order to cut the carbs ! i ate them with margarine and garlic salt and i loved them more than regular carb noodles luckily a local grocery store started selling them so i no longer have to pay the outrageous shipping price \( they are refrigerated \)	2
1	i just tried these noodles after reading article in first magazine for women thought they were great and i only used organic chicken broth with carrots i am very satisfied with the taste and ask everyone what are you expecting for a pasta substitute \? \? \? \? ! ! ! ! just do n't be so picky and be grateful there 's something to eat thats healthy low carb and low calorie and can be doctored up with all kinds of foods and ideas happy snackin	2
1	i was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but i am soooooo glad i did try them bec now i am hooked ! ! ! ! yes they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well in cold water right before i boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal ! i found the texture to be actually good like a firmer version of the ramen noodles ! i think these make an excellent snack or meal !	2
1	i lived in japan for many years really enjoyed using these noodles in soups stir fry korean style cooking etc if you are looking for pasta these may not exactly match your craving but are nonetheless really versatile ! my advice for those who do n't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them sprinkle liberally with salt rub through with clean hands then rinse in cold water this is how they prepare them in japan it removes any odor they are ready to use	2
1	this candy is the best and once you have it you will always long for it ! the candy is wonderful and the rice paper that melts in your mouth is a novelty and delicious there is a temporary tattoo with these candies thank you amazon com for making it easier to find	2
1	i 've been snacking on botan rice candy since i was a little girl my mom used to pick it up for us every time she visited the asian grocery store and i still have it a few times a year this candy is delicious ! sweet like honey but not too sweet chewy like caramel squares but not sticky and the sticker is sometimes a tattoo bonus ! it 's fun	2
1	if i could survive on pocky and pocky alone i would do it this is the world 's perfect snack food strawberry is the best of them all though i am partial to the coconut and chocolate flavors too sweet creamy strawberry y goodness coats a thin crispy cracker stick making for a one of a kind taste sensation in your mouth plus one tip is uncoated so you do n't even have to get your hands dirty if you only try one japanese food this is the one try it you wo n't be disappointed	2
1	i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	2
1	my japanese pen pal y yamamoto just adores strawberry pocky and tells me they 're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations mind you i'm not sure i should believe yohko chan as she describes these situations many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way but i must admit they 're entertaining reading and the souvenier she sent me from that space hot springs was rather interesting although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me still i want to date her friend ruuan she looks hot in an amazingly ditzy sort of way	2
1	i think this is a great product i enjoy the chocolate dip caramel dip and this marshmallow dip with fruit especially strawberries	2
1	i eat this on peanut butter toast for breakfast everyday and love it i think it 's a great product as good as regular marshmallow dip \? probably not but if you want a hint of marshmallow with no calories in one serving it 's good stuff	2
1	i do n't know what everyone else is talking about ! this dip is delicious ! i like to put a scoop ontop of some sliced up strawberrys and yummy ! the chocolate is only okay but this marshmellow tastes just like the real dip its not supposed to tasts like marshmellow fluff or anything ! highly reccomended from a girl with a sweet tooth	2
1	wow i thought they stopped making these ! when i was younger i used to run up my street to the store just to buy some they were so sour but so good	2

1	i liked these i was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package but mine did n't smell at all i followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique \( unique good \) texture these noodles were n't like pasta but they were good i 'll have no problem eating them agian as a matter of fact i thought they were quite delicious	2
1	if you 've missed your favorite pastas because of your low carb diet this definitely is the product for you though it does n't have the starchy quality of pasta it 's a convincing substitute if you 're do n't mind sacrificing texture for a low calorie low carb meal be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce otherwise you end up with a slimy mess otherwise i would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of atkins south beach etc	2
1	if you 're expecting egg pasta made from the finest durum wheat you 'll be disappointed but if you 're a fan of japanese sukiyaki stir fry udon and chow fun these low carb subs will be right up your alley also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes if the texture does n't bother you then go ahead and try it with your favorite western style dishes shirataki \( shredded konjac \) really has no flavor itself but like tofu it absorbs flavors extremely well in addition to being low in calories and carbs it 's very good for your digestive system ! eat up	2

1	it was good to be able to buy a hard to find item at a reasonable price	2
1	these noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles and made of tofu they wo n't add carbs to your diet i find i cannot eat processed starch upsets my stomach so these are a total lifesaver and the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing love'em	2
1	i was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but i am soooooo glad i did try them bec now i am hooked ! ! ! ! yes they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well in cold water right before i boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal ! i found the texture to be actually good like a firmer version of the ramen noodles ! i think these make an excellent snack or meal !	2
1	that 's right i just opened one up and got a temporary tattoo of a toucan no less ! this almost makes up for the lack of cool plastic toy but since we 'll never see the cool toy again i 'll take this over bizarre sticker any day	2
1	i bought this over 6 months ago from an asian food store it is so good ! it 's really cool how the rice paper melts in your mouth i gave some to my little cousins and they loved it it 's a wonderful thing to suck on and it 's not very sticky either it also comes with a sticker or a tatoo	2
1	this candy is the best and once you have it you will always long for it ! the candy is wonderful and the rice paper that melts in your mouth is a novelty and delicious there is a temporary tattoo with these candies thank you amazon com for making it easier to find	2
1	i have been suffering from nausea for about six months now and have tried it all i decided to order your chews and some crystalized ginger and it works i finally figured out it was my gallbladder and soon i will be nauseous free but thank goodness for my ginger chews	2
1	i buy these ginger chews for when i feel sick to my stomach they really help	2
1	this has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor without managing to be overwhelming i cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach that being said whatever ends up getting you interested in this product whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish desk etc my only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly	2
1	yummy green tea pocky ! ! ! ! ! just make sure you purchase this in the fall winter months otherwise it 'll melt in the mail i would 've given this 5 stars had the pocky not melted together into a lump	2
1	i love green tea pocky it 's flavour is indescribable ! it 's sweet yet light you can only eat a few though before it 's enough for ya i 'd suggest that everyone try these they 're that good dalso the strawberry pocky with little chunks on them are awesome too try them	2
1	pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills	2
1	i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	2
1	i do n't even like tea but these candies are delicious on first taste they 're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating as you continue eating the candy it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy very tasty and definitely grows on you ! one warning they 're not a healthy snack so watch out how many the you and the kids eat	2
1	this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall and my first review here at amazon as well these matcha candies get better and better with each one i can see how they could become quite addictive ! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated this flavor takes some getting used the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder and then the inside is all chewy and decadent yummy actually i think i'm already addicted ! ! also nice to travel with or put in your bag these wo n't melt or make a mess	2
1	obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot ! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope ! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass	2
1	the taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big when i first saw that i wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia nope these are for everyone it is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate i cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time share this with some friends would be fun to have these for a party	2
1	when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better it is more slender with richer chocolate it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much very balanced if you love chocolate this is definitly better worth trying	2
1	as it say so astutely on box of glowing color this yum yum pocky is for men only it not good or happy for womens to consume do not dare to ask why for that journey will not be pleasant only accept and then you will see the joys of pocky this pocky for men get other pocky for womens then two can be most happiness in joy of whirlwinds	2
1	we just tried this excellent cheese sampler package the quality is superb and i have just ordered their 4 pound package the cheeses are of excellent quality you cant go wrong an excellent buy 5 star rated	2

1	this is my favorite tea it 's strong and spicy and to me tastes like cinnamon and orange i prefer it hot but like it cold especially in the summer i think it 's the best thing on winter mornings	2
1	my first experiance with marketspice tea was on a cold day in alaska it 's warming tastes great and is just what 's needed on a cold day i discribe the tea as orange flavored with a bite it 's aroma fills a room creating a warm feeling	2
1	my husband and i were introduced to market spice tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in seattle we loved it and upon our return to jamesville ny begain to regularly order it many of our friends now order it too it is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea	2
1	tea of course is a matter of taste and this one fits my taste to a tee \( p i \) i'm generally not a tea drinker but was first given this product as a gift that was five years ago and i'm hooked we even moved to europe and i get it sent over here	2
1	of all teas i 've tried this is my favorite sweet powerful and fragrant marketspice is the answer for many moods and cravings i prefer this tea hot steeped for 5 minutes but its good cold as well although i 've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming be warned if you only like very subtle white teas this may not be for you but it has converted many a non tea drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	2
1	i was always hunting for popcorn salt in markets and only occasionally finding it this is just what i wanted and in a large enough size to be economical and last for a whil	2
1	i 've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it \( for like 2 years \) i mainly wanted it for texture table salt is not fine enough this stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors i would n't have believed it myself	2
1	this is a great product it 's texture makes it perfect for other things besides popcorn with salt in so many products i do n't worry about the lack of iodine in this salt after all it 's not like you eat it everyday in fact it sticks so well you can actually use less good product	2
1	this glitter looks great on cookies frosted or not ! i love it ! thanks	2

1	there is no better way to drive home t s eliot 's the love song of j alfred prufrock than to hold a peach and read shall i part my hair behind \? do i dare to eat a peach \? chomp i shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach \( and shall i dare yet again to eat a peach and teach \? \) munch munch i have heard the mermaids singing each to each \( but i do not care to preach i only dare to eat a peach \) slurp it gives me an intelligent excuse to snack while i'm lecturing	2
1	on a hot summer 's day after a hard day at work there 's nothing i want more than a delicious fruit from the beautiful prunus persica amazon offers this convenient 4 pack great for sharing with your crew the scrumptious peach is one of my top 10 favorite fruits right behind bananas strawberries apples grapes watermelon tomatoes blueberries blackberries and nectarines then you 've got the peach georgia knew what it was doing when it was selecting it 's state fruit !	2
1	if you could condense heaven into a colorful 3 diameter sphere it would be a peach they are candies that grow on trees are picked by angel elves and teleported directly to your local grocery store to avoid blemishes one day i was eating a peach while walking downhill and caused a peach juice slide everybody on the sidewalk jumped on the slide and it carried them down to a radiant peach pool at the bottom which everyone splashed into with a wave of orgasmic bliss said best by the presidents of the united states of america nature 's candy in my hand can or pie	2
1	like an apricot but better in my opinion the downy fuzz the sweet juicy flesh there really is nothing like a good peach i think they are best on their own though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba that is fine but i would strongly advise against cooking them in my opinion this is a waste of a good peach a friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon but he is a savage and a charlatan to conclude peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around there are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day	2
1	this tea is really out of the ordinary and i think people either love it or hate it ! i love it ! it has a wonderful flavor and is one of my favorites give it a try you might be pleasantly surprised	2
1	an incredibly refreshing drink when iced ! mix in a teaspoon of honey while your tea is warm and then pour over a generous amount of ice because of the ice use two bags and steep for three minutes or more depending on your taste you will be pleasantly surprised	2

1	if you like strong coffee typical of the flavors used in better expresso brews this is about the best one we have ever found period ! it 's worth the money you have to ante up and the extra hassle required in order to buy	2

1	lindt lindor truffles are so good you wo n't believe it very bad for dieters best chocolates for the price in the world	2
1	i was very pleased with the quality of this blend it contained the exact amount of sumac it makes a perfect rub for lamb the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is the small amount for the price	2
1	i really enjoyed this soup the flavor is delightful plus all natural ingredients and low fat make it a healthy meal	2
1	i love black bean soup and this is the best mix i have ever bought as a previous reviewer stated vegetables mix very well with this soup i recently added a drained can of corn to get another serving and it tasted great	2
1	very sophisticated complex flavor not normally found in a mix great alone or as a base for your own creative additions it gets so thick it could be reduced a bit further and used as a bean dip i added more water at the end of cooking for a looser soupier consistency we finished each bowl with a sprinkling of chopped jalape os cilantro and scallions which added a hit of brightness to the smoky undertones i ca n't wait to try the other flavors i ordered ! this soup was favorably reviewed by all ages in my kitchen and that does n't happen often	2
1	i am sooooo very happy that agave is now available in the large container this brand is the best of the agave	2
1	i love chocolate and always buy the 70 on up variety 's so i looked forward to trying these i expected some bitterness but these tasted \( when eaten raw \) like burnt chocolate nuts i still prefer to eat them this way though	2
1	i'm very happy to have discovered these will definitely continue to use them in baking it helps me cut back on the semi sweet choc morsels with a healthier alternative as far as eating them raw i do n't recommend it at all ! ! ! very bitter taste raw maybe some would enjoy it but i would venture a guess that it 's a minority of people rather than a majority	2
1	i love this little things i usually get them at the candy store in the mall has a very close taste to the real thing	2
1	after visiting cape town south africa i fell in love with all gold tomato sauce \( catsup \) it have a unique flavor that makes the domestic brands seem rather bland	2

1	it 's easy to make \( recommended measures are available online and you can go a little more milk or powder if you want \) and the package makes alot i like not having a 45 minute drive to get my favorite drink	2
1	this is awesome ! ! tastes like its a complex home mixture of spices etc for chai tea but its all in a simple tea bag ! amazing	2
1	the chai mixes in tetrapacks are too sweet for my tastes this chai tea brews up spicy and good and you can mix in milk or soymilk plus any sweetner you like to make delicious chai	2
1	my husband and my son in law really went insane with dave 's insantity hot sauce ! they put about 3 drops on their food and it was beyond hot they we 're very impressed ! and they knew next time one drop would do the trick even though that was hot too the other hot sauces in the sampler we 're just right !	2
1	whatever that thing is that hot sauce does for you dave 's does it double i have also found that dave 's steak sauce makes a fabulous secret ingredient \( in small doses \) to spaghetti sauce stews anything that improves with a tiny bit of heat \( think tabasco only with flavor \)	2
1	i 've always liked this candy but i could n't find them anywhere in stores near me so i ordered a case	2
1	the coffee is really good and i will tell my friends about it the order came real qick like in no time i was really surprise so everthing was real nic	2
1	besides being a very good deal for the price this item thankfully does not contain lavender which is not commonly used in french cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests however the classic mix of herbes de provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb marjoram	2
1	i thought the steaks were really good they were tender and delicious they were a little small for my boyfriend and cooked up fast i thought they were the perfect size for myself delivery was fast	2
1	flake a rippled layer of chocolate in the adverts you need to eat it in the bath in order to avoid dropping chocolate crumbs buy them and put them in the fridge eat your flake while balanced over a plate to catch the crumbs divine so much better than typical us chocolate yum	2
1	this stuff is incredible ! melt in you mouth pure chocolate hand made by lepricons in cadbury ireland using only the finest ingrediants thoes firey little green men put nestly and hershy to shame ! !	2
1	this is the most deliciuos chocolate ! it can be a bit messy but it 's well worth it ! if you love chocolate you 'll love flakes	2
1	did you move from the north down south \? or have you never even had a funnybone well whatever the case is if you like peanutbutter and devilsfood cake funnybones are fot you ! these things are great you may want to get more than one box cause the wont last long at all ! ! ! !	2
1	i love funny bones first of all i'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter together add an incredible consistancy shiny chocolate coating around chocolate cake with peanut butter cream filling well put these in the fridge a spell take them out and voila ! the perfect munchy snack attack enjoy	2
1	well it worked out great because they were bought for a friend who now resides in california but is originally from new york they arrived in a timely fashion and they were in good condition and enjoyed by all in fact i would order them again	2
1	this product is great ! tastes fresh and enhances many foods and i was quite surprised that the container it came in was kind of like a pepper mill you just twist cap back forth like you would do with fresh pepper and the product comes out this product has many uses but really comes in handy for those sweet sour recipes i added this along with some pineapple to my chicken and it was outstanding	2
1	this is a strongly aromatic version of earl grey scented with citrusy bergamot if you like a mild earl grey this may be a bit strong for you i personally love it one of my favorites	2
1	there is a reason they serve this coffee at the white house its the smoothest best coffee ever produced low acid smooth in the mouth and it has the most intoxicating aroma worth the price	2
1	this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only 12 for 12 ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it	2
1	i was a blubbery dude after downing countless gallons of tuscan whole milk people were calling me shamu the whale and gluteus maximus after i gained about a hundred pounds made me come up with a rhyme about what happened next then a friend gristedes told me about the skim a hundred pounds lighterwithout goin out on a limb it 's got style it 's got class it took a big weightoff my stomach	2
1	as my class of middle school students and i enjoyed the comments for tuscan whole milk one thought kept popping into our heads why not skim \? why heap such praise upon whole milk and neglect skim whose delightfully low fat content has made my morning ecstatic for years \? i believe tuscan skim milk will allow me to live forever \( though i have n't proved that one yet \) my students say it enables them to do difficult homework with ease so at last we can breathe a full sigh of relief that amazon is providing the world with the joy of skim	2
1	from italy 's famed milk region tuscan whole milk 1 gallon 128 fl oz and tuscan 2 low fat milk 1 gallon 128 fl oz are guaranteed to satisfy the birthplace of the italian renaissance is also the birthplace of the world 's most delectable beverage tuscan whole milk leonardo da vinci michelangelo and dante alighieritable were known to imbibe in tuscan whole milk 1 gallon 128 fl oz 's sweeth frothy goodness some say that milk was the inspiration for the mona lisa now the milk growers of tuscan have released tuscan skim milk 1 gallon 128 fl oz a lighter taste with less creamy overtones in my opinion an improvement over their earlier release and is my libation of choice bon appetit	2
1	we received a box as a gift last week \( ca n't keep our hands out of the box ! \) it truly tastes fresh what a treat it reminds me of the fresh boxes of chocolates i used to pick up on business trips in belgium and netherlands you wo n't be disappointed	2
1	i had this stuff almost every day while living in chile for 2 years let me tell you there is almost no comparison with the non fat milk we drink here in the states this stuff is way better do n't quote me on this but i heard that nido is n't 100 non fat that being the case it does n't keep as long as non fat powdered milk but i might be wrong at any rate it 's worth it if you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up	2
1	i prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one they 're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips if you like old school jerky then i highly recommend this product delicious	2
1	this coffee is the best product for the senseo coffee maker that i have found the coffee has a rich full taste	2
1	i 've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best ! ! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter the kenya aa has a great rich roast flavor	2
1	i give four because i have n't tried other jasmine green tea products otherwise beginning to end experience from this seller is excellent	2
1	this tea is awesome i had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet after finding it on amazon i looked up all the benefits of green tea and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting so i ordered the jasmine green tea and with a little sugar and lemon i drink it every day excellent product ca n't live without it	2
1	i drink this brand of jasmine green tea every single day at work the lower level of caffeine eases me awake as opposed to giving me coffee jitters green tea is extremely good for you and also happens to taste amazing ! i recommend this to anyone it also makes a great iced tea for a different twist	2
1	i found this syrup to be quite tasty on apples and other things or even on a spoon you can use it to drizzle on things instead of honey or maple syrup you can use it in making rice krispisy truely golden syrup is wonderful	2
1	i used this years ago when i lived in europe and tried it again recently when i found it on amazon it adds a wonderful molasses taste in recipes calling for corn syrup like pecan bars and chocolate frosting it 's a hit with my friends one likes oatmeal now with a spoonful of the syrup	2
1	the greatest tasting syrup ever made excellent on toast no other syrup can come close forty years ago i thought it was the greatest and it still is ! i am having a hard time purchasing it in my province in canada and it is worth the effort to order it on line i wish they would expand their distribution	2
1	i would almost move back to ny from phoenix az to get drakes this is the best at least i have gristedes to order from i just cant take the winters anymore bob goldstei	2
1	ideal for people who expect to fancy a snack in about 1 2 business days time	2
1	these little cakes are so good with coffee and a real treat especially when frozen they can be a little dry if eaten without a beverage otherwise but they are an all time favorite of mine since i was a little girl growing up in brooklyn ny this company also used to put out little cream filled cakes called yankee doodles but i do n't think they are around anymore i'm just glad drake 's was kind enough to keep one of them going and i'm glad i found a place where i could order them without bothering my sister in ny all the time they 're worth the try	2
1	hottest sauce in the universe no brag just fact i find that a single drop of dave 's ultimate insanity is more than equivalent to ten drops of tabasco why not five stars \? while this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat i find the taste of tabasco more pleasant ultimate insanity adds a hint of a smokey burnt flavor which i assume is due to the roasted peppers try it for yourself this the most heat you can get without notifying the fire marshall	2
1	this is the stuff hallucinogens bow before the warning states that it 's not for anyone with poor heart conditions high blood pressure or contemplating pregnancy ever and it means it one drop of this sauce in anything will have your eyes watering and your stomach curdling why it 's in a bottle this big i 'll never know but this stuff is the real deal i was foolish enough to have three drops in a shot of vodka one fateful night many moons ago and i still tremble at the memory i ca n't rate it high enough so five stars will have to do	2
1	so much better than buying those pre packaged microwave popcorns always the way i like it	2
1	i love this popcorn i buy loads of it so i never run out i do n't know why this is n't the most popular popcorn out there i do n't think people know about it or maybe they do n't want to have to cook it but it 's so easy and good	2
1	this is probably the best popcorn you can make at home packaged with the whirley pop stovetop popcorn popper and you have a great little gift set sidenote it probably is n't the healthiest popcorn for you \( there is a lot of oil and butter flavoring \) but it is the tastiest ! !	2
1	i tired real theater popcorn last night for the first time and managed to eat the entire thing by myself ! ! it was that good if this is n't exactly like movie theater popcorn it 's as close as it gets ! i'm purchasing the 20 pack today and am going to hand out a few packs to my friends whom share the same love of popcorn that i do it 's good !	2
1	i bought some of this for my husband last christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper \( the kind with the stir rod \) now it 's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it the packages come with pre measured oil popping corn and you just cook it all up each box has 5 bags each bag makes a big bowl \( \? 20 cups \? \) we only have to add salt and we love the taste i highly recommend this with a stir rod popper too either the stovetop or electric kind	2
1	i 'll never eat microwave popcorn again ! this is quick and delicious and looks and tastes like movie theater popcorn only better ! it 's hard to believe but true	2
1	i 've always loved these little cherries haribo has just the right flavor and texture buy in bulk save a lot	2
1	i go to the movie theaters and they always have these gummy cherries these are so good ! i would n't dare share these ! they are highly addictive and i can gobble them up in a minute	2
1	this flavor of hot cocoa is my favorite we love this cocoa ! it is incredibly delicious	2
1	if you 're a candy addict like i am these are dangerous ! they arrived quickly and are fresh i 've kept them in a tupperware container so they do n't get hard or stale and have been happily munching away for 3 months	2
1	the basket was a big hit with the ladies at my office i highly recommend it	2
1	the recepients of this gift loved it ! it arrived in time for christmas and was well packaged	2
1	i love lindt lindor chocolate truffles i fell in love with the milk chocolate and since i am such a big white chocolate fan as well i had to try this one its divine i will give it that but it tasted more like vanilla frosting than white chocolate it felt like i was eating some sort of vanilla cake frosting out of a can than white chocolate so i was dissapointed that aspect but it really is a great item despite that	2
1	great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike more of an end of the night activity unless you 're just having a dessert party of course ! my one complaint is the impractical \( although oh so whimsical \) tissue packaging it is hazardously absorbent even the assertive flavors of these high quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items note do not store next to your curry sampler best of luck chocoholics a z	2
1	i saw this at whole foods and bought it from there i wanted something nice to bring to a house party and did n't feel like bringing flowers it was a hit ! it really is very pretty and memorable it was one of a kind plus a small piece made a nice dessert with coffee well worth the price it would be fun for a chocolate tasting event	2
1	these are the by far best gummy bears more fruity flavored than artificial i get these any time i go to europe they are all over germany i recommend them to anyone who loves the gummy variety of candy	2
1	do n't go for generic gooey dollar store imitations this is what gummy bears are supposed to be the next best are black forest	2
1	it 's great to have the option to enjoy drake 's even on weight watchers each package is only 4 weight watcher points and they still taste like drake 's ! yum	2
1	liked these alot just like the ones i buy at the candy store would buy agai	2
1	i love gummie candy but the bears were a little harder then i expected but they were still good	2
1	you ca n't get these anywhere in this town but amazon has saved the day ! there were plenty of leaves and they were very tasty in the tom ka soup we made and various other dishes good and fresh	2
1	this was the best experience i had mixed feelings about ordering food products and from a new company with amazon but it was wonderful the leaves are just great and taste great too they were very appologetic because of weather it shipped out a couple of days late but i still got them ontime i can not wait to use all of the leaves to order \( as well as more ingredients \) from them	2
1	other places where offering 4 or 5 oz for the same price it was sent and arrived quickly faster than expected great for asian recipes good deal	2
1	if you like them small you wo n't be disappointed tasty though i would upgrade to the bigger ones	2
1	a fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat i bought it for a gift for my brother so i ended up sampling using them myself truly flavorful ! and hot ! i use it in my omelets burritos nachos beans	2
1	these steaks were tender and tasted very good so good in fact we ordered more	2
1	this is a good selection of ingredients to start making sushi it has everything you need except fillings but there are no instructions i recommend getting a simple book like sushi made easy to give you the basics i was pleased with the quality of the ingredients i might buy this again if i find myself out of everything at once	2
1	this is really good tender a little sweet easy to make in the whirley pop and excellent with some cheddar spice popcorn seasoning	2
1	i love little white kernels of popped corn this was good stuff but i think i 'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time my preference	2
1	pops great in the microwave much better than many store brands good product	2
1	i wo n't claim to be a professional food taster i just know what i like and do n't like i do n't like yellow popcorn i do n't like microwave popcorn i like the white popcorn cooked in a pan for my popping style the baby white pops great w o lots of hard kernels 'nuf said	2
1	they got the texture and the level of sweetness just right these were fabulous if a tad bit expensive for a special treat i would buy these again	2
1	this seller sent exactly what was described fast shipping well packed thank yo	2
1	i was a little hesitant as to whether these would taste good or not however i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived i will say this though i had the impression that the center was kind of creamy however it was solid which made it even better when allowing it to melt in your mout	2
1	the kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool they appear to be quite fresh have cooked with them it was wonderful thank	2
1	i live in a small town and you ca n't buy these in the stores they are very nice leaves some smaller but most very nice sized excellent for thai food i froze mine so i should have enough to last at least a year	2
1	have n't tried cooking with them yet but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way they are beautiful specimens i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them	2
1	in my case it was for my dad 's birthday a couple days ago and it went great i placed my order a week before the event \( i know probably could have been too late \) but it arrived 3 days later packaged really well in dry ice if you 're looking for a gift for a male relative you will never go wrong with getting him some omaha steaks	2
1	gave this as a gift to my father for fathers day ! he loved it ! said the steaks arrived in excellent condition packed in dry ice and we 're very enjoyable ! one of the best fathers days gifts	2
1	item as expected services average shipping cost was n't as ecconomical as i would have liked to have seen but obviously i paid it i probably could have found the tea in a store but am hard pressed to get anywhere so all in all everything went as expected	2
1	i 've bought all sizes shapes and scents and this is my hands down favorite candle the aroma is crisp and clean without being soapy fragrant without being overpoweringly floral it 's just refreshing and calming and strong enough to clear cooking smells from a kitchen my only complaint is that it only comes in green which does n't match my house	2
1	had good taste but you sure could n't make a sandwitch out of it just bighunks of meat its nothing like the pictures	2
1	i have tried pretty much every brand of single serve coffe pods out there and i have found black mountain gold to be the richest and most flavorable i highly recommend everyone to try this brand	2
1	i 've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best ! ! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter the guatemalan antigua decaf is delicious	2
1	i'm on a low carb diet and did n't like just eating a bowl of plain tuna with mayo yuck ! i add a cup of dreamfield 's elbows to give me a better lunch for only 5 net carbs and now i actually look forward to having tuna also for 7 carbs you can add shredded cheese a drop of milk a pat of butter and pinch of salt to indulge yourself in a creamy macaroni with cheese dish ! yummy o	2
1	i have used this pasta for two years it has an excellent taste and consistency while being low carb much better than whole wheat choices i 've tried all the selections and all i can say is i'm looking forward to the company adding rigatoni and acini de pepe sometime in the future it 's hard to find in restaurants but if you are ever in pittsburgh they serve it at gullifty 's wonderful some diabetics may find it does n't work for them trial and error if you eat it because of diabetes	2
1	the tin makes the world of difference i purchased the large tin and have been using it for over 7 months the spice still smells extremely fresh	2
1	this is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience the taste is barley sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste the aftertaste is very mild and fresh green tea is touted for its health benefits not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight ! ! green tea averages about 10 30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box	2
1	you can get better tea if you 're willing to deal with leaves but that 's not practical for most of us especially for those who drink it at work like i do compare this to a budget brand bagged green tea \( like salada which i used to drink \) and you 'll be able to tell the difference right away the tazo is n't overbearingly flavorful \( no green tea is \) but its subtle green taste is addictive \( as is the caffeine ! \)	2
1	these are the best tasting steaks i have ever eaten ! i recommend the steaks to all meat lovers	2
1	since my husband perfected his technique of grilling omaha steak filet mignon we no longer order steak when we go out to dinner even at the most expensive fanciest restaurants their steak just is n't as good as what my husband does on the grill with these omaha steaks	2
1	hands down the best steaks i have ever had i scoff at people who would refer to them as dry they simply do n't know how to cook steak we have been buying omaha steaks products for 4 years no i am not a butcher but i do enjoy a good steak in terms of value 6 8 for a steak would scare me if i saw it on a menu at a restaurant these steaks are value there are no supermarkets in my area that can compete with these cuts of beef these days there are not a lot of products or companies out there who deliver consistent quality but omaha steaks is one company who continues to impress me	2
1	i deffinatley think this was a great value for this item maybe someone found it cheaper elsewhere regardless you get a lot for your money here	2
1	grapes mother nature 's candy i first became acquainted with grapes back in the summer of '84 when the wind came whistling over the planes old mumsie and i often held hands as we frolicked down half frozen fjords to stumble across wild grapes in our tree forest home it is on this note that i came to purchase these magical and tasty items and i can safely say i was not disappointed within three seconds of consuming these products my legs grew back and my chest hair took on a vitalise sheen	2
1	i find that when i have a little time on my hands i like to read what others have to say about nothing and i am always pleasantly surprised that they come through with useless opinions about nothing	2
1	my husband drinks tea daily he is very happy with this tea and recommends it to other	2
1	the tomato the other other white meat it 's whats for dinner	2
1	despite being a member of the solanaceae or often deadly nightshade family \( native to the americas \) i find tomatoes to be relatively friendly to my innards while i feel that masquerading as a vegetable is a bit deceptive \( they are technically a berry \) i am quite a fan of the tomato and find the notion that they were originally known as love apples to be rather quaint and charming not to mention tender juicy and delicious so tender and delicious mmmmmm	2
1	i like pasta and tomatoes are used in the sauce i put on pasta so i like tomatoes	2
1	i 've said it before i 'll say it again i'm a white gal who likes to throw her ample weight around ! i find these cupcakes to second only to the mighty ding dong when it comes to hostess treats the chocolate cake is great and the frosting is absolutely delectable avoid the bastardization that is the golden hostess cupcake	2
1	this food calls back to my youth i'm still always impressed that these things can stay as moist as they do this is a major plus i'm really not so keen on the whole frosting thing and this one still finds me wanting with the urge to be sick just thinking about eating the filling but more power to them for having the retro cool thing going on and the ability to foist them off on adult aquaintences in need of a snack	2
1	delicious hostess chocolate cupcakes were the first hostess cupcakes you can now get orange flavored hostess cupcakes as well while homemade cupcakes are still the best if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat they have a soft chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top the only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat both at one time and altogether well i hear a hostess cupcake calling my name	2
1	i am so happy to have found this coffee this dark roast is rich in flavor a great cup of coffee brightens my day every day	2
1	i found it to be a bit gamey and that 's after 6 hours in a slow cooker it looks a bit tough and leathery in the photo and it really is plus i think mine had one or two shotgun buck pellets still in it does anyone know if there is a le village in greenwich \? maybe it is fresher to pick it up in store	2
1	wow ! ! this is awesome you guys have everything ! ! ! i ordered 20 for valentines day they serve as the lining of the valentines day baskets that i am donating to my local church after they dig into the delicious assortment of candies and fruit they can rejoice that they will find a fine fresh rabbit for stewing later that evening now if i only had some taters	2
1	a lot of my friends like to shop online so i added this to my baby registry my best friend received one at her shower and she loves it ! so when i got two at my shower it was n't the disaster other duplicate gifts can be ! my little girl is now three months old and we are still getting a lot of use out of the fresh whole rabbits	2
1	chortles picks up coney and breaks spine they are young ! they are tender they are nice yes they are ! eat them ! eat them ! what 's taters preciousss \? what 's taters \?	2
1	how can you not love the twinkie \? it 's compact delicious and aerodynamic if you actually look at the ingredients twinkies are made of flour water shortening eggs sugar sound familiar \? it 's cake there are some preservatives added to increase shelf life but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat the air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie let us face facts if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on twinkies twinkies like anything in moderation are just fine	2
1	yeah but they taste really good	2
1	why are you listed as a gourmet food \? amazon seems to have misfiled you as you 'd be more appropiately listed under joint compound as a child i loved you but as an adult i loathe you the lard filling sickens me but i 'll rate you a three just because of the cool factor of being listed on amazon	2
1	green bell peppers are very versatile great for stuffed peppers salads or sauteeing with italian sausage i'm a big fan of all peppers and would give most all peppers a high rating i had to bump the bell pepper down a star for its low rating on the scoville scale bell peppers rate a 0 on this scale of hotness just a little bit of spiciness would make these peppers a definite 5 star vegetable due to its versatility and delicious capsaicin taste but alas the bell pepper is void of that magical capsaicin and thus a 4 star vegetable	2
1	these coffee pods were delicious i my co worker and a doctor with whom i had to share these with so they could experience them also loved this cinnamon swirl flavored coffee the deliver was super fast a great transaction	2
1	these pods work well with my simplehuman coffee maker and i can get both an 8 oz cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet but do some comparison shopping if you buy directly from the java podz website the cost of both the pods and the s h are lower than buying through amazon	2
1	this is a very tasty brew just right strength for your regular mug on the senseo just hit the two cup button and its just right	2
1	this oolong simply tastes richer and fresher than any other my husband and i have tried we live in the hinterland of utah without any variety of oolong teas on most market shelves so we are happy to purchase it online	2
1	this flavor of land o' lakes cocoa is one of their best we love this cocoa	2
1	these are not the shriveled scrawny beans you find in a jar in the grocery store they are amazing do n't tell jr but he is n't charging enough !	2
1	these beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers the beans were shipped free and promptly	2
1	first order arrived damaged by the u s post office order was promptly replaced at no charge fast shipping to san franciscodelicious plump fragrant beans excellent product excellent customer service	2
1	i was very pleased with my order of vanilla beans the beans were soft and smelled wonderful i will order this product again	2

1	since i discovered this wonderful relish in england a few years ago i have tried to buy replacements in this country it is served at most pubs in the uk as part of a ploughman 's lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies it has a wonderful taste and texture unlike anything in this country i recommend every one buy some i 've found it only on amazon	2
1	this is the best sandwich topping ever ! i grew up eating branston pickle on my cheddar cheese and ham sandwiches so it holds lots of good memories for me it has a deliciously sweet and tangy taste some say \( e g my wife \) it is an acquired one and nice crunchiness from the pickled vegetables i cannot say enough good things about it	2
1	outstanding ! and it was soooooo nice to savor all the infused flavors	2
1	oh how i love the cucumis melo reticulatus ! it 's much sweeter and tastier than the cucumis melo cantalupensis \( the european cantaloupe \) you see the cmr is the american version this very same cantaloupe that 's produced in california this should be called the freedom musk melon true patriots eat the cmr ! if you 're some sort of brie eating french lover then go for the cmc you america hating hippy	2
1	after slicing through the outer rine of this pleasently heavy fruit an irresitable wealth of naturally sweet goodness is revieled this swollen ovary is undoubtably the greatest variety of cantaloupe in existance there is no comparison to cantaloupes grown in other areas the california jumbo cantaloupe makes any other variety look like achondroplastic cantaloupe this copious orb of delictableness is a must have for any herbivore or omnivore	2
1	i have been faithfully buying omaha steaks products for years in my grocer 's freezer and my butcher there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers you get what you pay for this company delivers consistent quality again and again i think other reviewers of omaha steaks product do n't know how to use their grill if you follow the step by step instructions presto perfect taste every time	2
1	aside from the grower dole i can not be more cpomplimentry of the dealerthat handled and packed the fruit and vegetables that received from amazon all of it was picture perfect and delicious this is after a 3 dayair shipment across the country ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	2
1	silver needle white tea is the finest tea i have ever tasted the flavor is delicate without being weak and there is no bitter aftertaste as with the majority of teas because there is less caffiene i did not experience the jittery nauseous feeling i get from other teas	2
1	how refreshing it is to know that we can turn to amazon for all our fresh elk carcass needs ! no more hoping to come across a large road kill on the way home from work ! perfect for wedding receptions birthday parties and anniversary celebrations you know all those fun times when you just have to dig that pit in the back yard and roast a large slab of meat slice up those leftovers and you 'll have sandwiches for weeks thank you amazon	2
1	this tea is just like you will find at the thai restaurant i find it best to brew in the coffee maker making it very strong and adding water to it later i use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine when it 's all brewed and hot i add the sugar more water and keep it in the fridge i add evaporated milk as needed per each glass it 's a wonderful drink for a summer day	2
1	speedy shipment on this product have not tried it yet but the quality packaging and so forth seem very good	2
1	now i can make my own thai iced tea at home that 's every bit as good as my favorite thai restaurant 's ! fragrant flavorful beautiful color as well full 5 star ratings for this product	2
1	i got this set for my husband for part of his christmas present and he loved it he did n't know that dave 's insanity was n't the hottest he could get until now he immediately opened the ultimate and started practicing eating it on crackers until it would n't make him sweat so he could embarrass his brother by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays next year i'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer and maybe the nuts too	2
1	lindt lindor truffles are very smooth quite rich and very sweet they tend to melt in your mouth \( and in your hands so get shoveling \) for me they 're a bit too sweet as i prefer the taste of leonidas or cote d'or chocolates as they have a bit more bite to them they are also much harder to find and more expensive soooooo if you want good rich chocolate and you like your chocolate sweet lindt lindor truffles is a good place to look	2
1	these are the best truffles i have ever ever tasted ! they come in milk chocolate dark chocolate and white confection the chocolate lovers dream ! ! ! there are 18 pieces per package control yourself though the serving size is only 7 pieces ! ! the creamy filling is heavenly ! ! my absolute favorite is the white confection my mouth waters just thinking about it ! ! ! if you love chocolate you need to find a package of these you 'll be in paradise with every bite ! 1smileycat	2
1	i ordered this for my husband 's christmas present on december 21st i really did n't think it would arrive in time and had printed a picture to give him until it arrived it arrived on the 23rd ! ! ! ! it was well packaged and was delivered intact he is absolutely delighted with it he has a hot sauce collection and this is definately the piece de resistance ! thank yo	2
1	this is definitely the best hot sauce ever an exceptionally hot sauce but comes with a great flavor and after taste not to be used by itself but as an additive in very small doses i bought my bottle in 1998 and am only half way through it love it	2
1	the sardines was very tasty they were packed in a box and were in very good condition i would recomend them to anybody keep up the good work	2
1	people always tell me malfouka those sardines are n't any good you should try brand x well they 're wrong king oscar knows sardines and until you try them \( i recommend serving them on buttered toast with a small squeeze of miracle whip \) you do n't know what you 're missing !	2
1	bought the carbquick and wish i did n't does not taste good and when baking with it definately comes out different than the regular bisquick will not buy again	2
1	simply amazing one of the best low carb products around forget atkins bake mix this is low carb bisquick now it is not as good as bisquick but it is good ! makes good biscuits a killer pie crust and yummy drop danish \( not really a danish consistancy tastes like very sweet pie crust \) plus can use with spices as a breading for chicken fish veggies cheese buy it ! !	2
1	clark 's teaberry gum became the rage in the 1960s when herb alpert and the tijuana brass played the teaberry shuffle originally produced by the d l clark company who got their fame with the clark bar the gum is a pittsburgh favorite for over 100 years the mild flavor is somewhere between wintermint and a very faint touch of cinnamon that somehow gives it a bit of a tea taste it is a very sublte flavore which is to me much more refreshing than the extra strong gums from the other guys there is also a sugar free variet	2
1	this was not exactly what i was expecting i thought it would be more like what i call vietnamese sesame balls yet they were pretty good despite my mistake	2
1	i gave 3 sets of popcorn along with the bowls to 4 people for christmas they were delighted and rave abouth the popcorn	2
1	these centipedes are wonderful ! they have a lot of flavor and last a long time !	2

1	this tea is fabulous ! and what a great deal ! i will be buying more of this tea ! it is better than green tea	2
1	i love this tea the filterbag smelled unbelievable and the beverage itself brewed up into this gorgeous dark pink color i wish i 'd used my clear glass mug i added a little sugar because i ca n't drink anything without a little sweetener but your average person probably would do fine with it this stuff is terrific i definitely recommend it	2
1	i have tried many teas in my life amp this by far has gone over the top with me i have tried 4 different flavors all of which were very satisfying the one i liked best is tazo chai it has a spice flavor that just captivates the taste buds it may not be for every one but since i like the taste amp smell of exotic spices this does very well for me i will buy it amp keep it on hand as much as possible	2
1	i was surprised by some unexpected guests for dinner i had not opened the jar before so i was n't sure how to use it i decided to pour it over boneless skinless chicken breasts cover the dish with tin foil and bake it was a hit ! ! even my husband liked it and he is very picky and stuck on old favorites i just bought a couple more jars	2
1	i bought some of this after seeing it featured on food finds at first i thought it would be a good alternative to cranberry sauce at thanksgiving but it 's even better than that it 's not tart like regular cranberry even with all the different tart fruits in the ingredients it 's surprisingly smooth and surprisingly good i 've tried it on ice cream with cheese and crackers and have even put it on barbequed pork so far it 's been fabulous on everything i just keep trying to find more things to try it on ! will definitely be buying this one again	2
1	our son has a gluten allergy and we have tried everything on the market to replace flour none of the mixes tasted hardly edible until we tried pamela 's we would use this even if we did n't have to go gluten free it is excellent for everything from pancakes waffles breads breading brownies you get the idea	2
1	a friend went on a trip to costa rica and brought this coffee back with her i loved it from the first cup i 've been a starbucks fan for a long time but this coffee is way better than starbucks i just received my first order from cafe britt it arrived very promptly and in great condition if you love coffee i 'd highly recommend giving this coffee a try	2
1	i'm only a little bit of a coffee nut but i really like this coffee my fiance 's father brought some back from costa rica while he was there on business i have just finished my bag and already miss it this was one of the best coffees i have tasted well balanced not too acidic not too bitter just right in my opinion it 's really good served traditionally hot but it 's also great iced and as with all coffees it 's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself my opinion a must try	2
1	this is the real deal people this is real jamaican coffee there are a few brands that claim to be from blue mountain but they do not have that authentic taste my wife is jamaican and we have been to jamaica a few times but i never seem to bring back enough coffee so i set out to find a brand here in the states that would be atleast close to what you get in jamiaca and this is it wow what flavor	2
1	after trying this tea in a sampler pack from starbucks i loved it ! ! ! i couldnt believe the flavor i went pack to purchase it separately and starbucks said it was only available in sampler packs so i am thrilled to see i can buy it here	2

1	i love this pasta so much that i'm constantly paranoid that it 's not really low carb there is absolutely no taste difference and it preps exactly the same as regular pasta	2
1	this stuff is great a fresh alternative to the regular suspects highly recommended to those who like a bit of a kick in their palate	2
1	these are very yummy i used to eat the gummy coke bottles all the time in germany where i grew up if you like gummy candy eat these	2

1	i did n't realize when i bought them they were so big i just thought they were little bottles they still have the same great taste	2
1	i absolutely am addicted to these i was taking lipitor for my cholestrol and could n't have pink grapefruit juice or eat pink grapefruit which i absolutely love but these satisfied my craving for it completely plus it did n't interfere with the meds ! i brought the bag to work and put them in my candy jar on my desk and have gotten several other people hooked on them ! they 're the best	2
1	haribo 's has the best gummi candy i love the pink grapefruit but it is very hard to find unless you have acess to a candy store haribo has the best candy amazon has the best price	2
1	different taste from the white grapefruit but both are addicting like potato chips but not as bad for you	2
1	this is some of the best coffee i have ever had short of sitting in a costa rican resturaunt and having each cup of coffee made right before your eyes i would suggest buying a bag of these beans my family has brought this coffee back with us from costa rica when opportunity permits and now i am very excited that it is available online once you have tried this coffee you will understand how coffee was meant to be consumed	2
1	i received my beans in a promptly manner and was able to make vanilla extract vanilla sugar and have extra for cooking purposes the beans were moist fresh and very aromatic	2
1	i have had my friends taste the hungarian then taste the spanish paprica ans the hungarian won all of them over it truely makes any meat taste better and the gravy is out of this world	2
1	if one has to be on a restricted diet and finds a company or in this case a bakery that supplies treats to those who can not eat regular sweets this wonderful bakery is the answer their bagels danishes and doughnut are very good yes they are smaller than the usual portions but the quality is a they have packed their danishes in regular cake pastry boxes and their doughnuts in plastic form cases to protect the doughnuts the service is excellent they ship on monday through wednesday with two day shipping i am a regular customer especially for their hearty low carb bagels	2
1	these egg whites work great and are economical i recently started a diet where i can only eat egg whites it seems such a waste to throw out the yolks not to mention the mess of separating the eggs i use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods the powdered egg whites do have an eggy odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets	2
1	i add this stuff to my protein shakes and it does n't ruin the taste as long as you keep the mix in proportion	2
1	recently on a new diet \( that works \) cannot eat whole eggs so was trying to find a large container for a good price honeyville grain company has this 2 25 lb can for 14 99 i paid 13 99 for 57 egg white in a 8 oz can figure this out this can has 301 egg whites also steel cut oats from honeville grain a 70 oz can for 7 99 you ca n't beat this price glori	2
1	i recently started a diet where i could only eat the egg white not the yolk because of the fat content i make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source the powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen \( anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what i'm talking about \) not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore i also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs this is a fantastic product and well worth the cost	2
1	i use these onions for just about everything they are pretty mild and really add a nice light flavor to your cooking this is about what i pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order but then again it is online shopping for groceries so i guess it has to be pricey i use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath ! great great stuff and i highly recommend them	2
1	this is best used when chopped into little pieces and spread copiously throughout the house it leaves a lovely aroma that will have your guests talking	2
1	i highly recommend these onions they are absolutely fab ! great in anything from salsa fresca to roasted pork they are even great on their own or fresh just do n't let the wife smell you	2

1	el yucateco hot sauces are great i 've been enjoying the red and green for a long time i also tried the other ones the carribean which is good and the habanero extra hot sauce is exactly what its called it is hotter than all the others i think the best el yucateco i 've tried was the chipotle one which sadly is not included overal el yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor	2
1	it is very difficult to find merguez and these were excellent and arrived in excellent condition and tasted very good	2
1	product came in good condition and was delicious ! it is expensive but very good	2
1	my family has purchased this hot cocoa several times now and whenever we get close to running out we make sure to get more asap we first got it at a local market but now get it through amazon we have had great experience with the vendor and the cocoa itself it can be used for traditional hot choclate without being too sweet like the mass produced brands and makes an excellent mix with coffee we have even used it to make cold drinks ice milk and azteca d'oro is my son 's favorite cold drink	2
1	order placed through amazon and product received2 days later interesting that the amazonprice is lower than going to the mocafeweb site directly great product hard to findelsewhere though occasionally carried bytrader joe 's	2
1	it is as close to theatre topping as it could be good taste good flavor a in my book or should i say on my popcorn	2
1	im not sure about the other products out there but this stuff will make you believe your at the theater the only problem is with the application there are no instructions and its really thick so i have found the only way is to pour some into a small container \( i used an old mustard squirt container \) then spread cooked popcorn all level in the maker then apply some liberally on top then mix it all together after doing that twice the popcorn is perfect the only problem is that itmakes the popcorn maker allot messier then if you applied it somewhere else good luc	2
1	this butter flavored popcorn topping is perfect if you 're looking to make popcorn that tastes like what you get at the movie theatre it is a very large bottle however so you better like popcorn a lot if you 're thinking about purchasing this product	2
1	a couple of years ago my friend rockie brought back some samples of market spice tea from seattle everyone loved it ! it has a strong spicy orange flavor i am so glad it is now available at amazon	2
1	a friend from seattle told me about the tea it is suprisingly good when i open this 50 pack at work all of my co worker wanted to try it most like it but one think it is too strong for her taste i have many different kind of tea at home this one definitely has it place	2
1	we have enjoyed market spice tea since our first taste at a local las vegas coffee house when the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we did n't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to seattle on vacation the tea is delicious ordering it on amazon was easy the delivery was fast and we all had it for christmas	2
1	ca n't beat it ! this was made world famous in pike place market and is now available on the internet	2
1	i love market spice tea and wish that it was something i could buy locally the only downside is a short shelf life but i keep it in the refrigerator and voila ! i enjoy a daily cup of tea	2
1	this tea is excellent spicy and naturally sweet so no added sugar is necessary if you like a sweet tea highly recommended	2
1	this tea is premium do n't accept green tea in bags it is less tasty and probably less healthy here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful cancer rheumatoid arthritis high cholesterol levels cariovascular disease infection impaired immune function acne omg and drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits	2
1	i do n't know why we ca n't get excellent quality green tea powder in this country without having to pay a fortune for it	2
1	but the previous reviewer does n't know that with his jittery comments he loves looking at what he writes on products he knows nothing about and does n't even try never helpful but allways full of himself and all that for your pleasure ! all for the price of nothing and thats what its worth	2
1	drink tea you 'll like the tea especially the tea in the big tin and if you drink enough of this tea you 'll be very healthy or very awake and jittery one of the two either way you can throw the tin at your neighbors when they are having another loud party outside and that ca n't be bad	2
1	marketspice tea is a great aromatic blend of teas and spices that delivers a rich full flavor unlike any other spice tea i have tried this tea is great to sip on a brisk winter morning be sure to keep the unused tea bags in a tightly sealed container as some of the aromatic oils with evaporate off if left open to the air	2
1	this tea is great with a little sugar or honey it is the kind of tea to have on a cold snowy winter day make a cup sit back wrapped in an afgan and let your mind wander as you sip this orange spice tasting tea the longer you leave the tea bag in the hot water the better grandma sharon from illinois farm country	2
1	as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree the rebecca review	2
1	i am a seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast as an avid tea drinker i frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that market spice tea is the greatest tea blend ever ! ! now that i can buy market spice on amazon i can finally prove it	2
1	the scent of this tea brewing is a real wake me up cinnamon nutmeg allspice and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors the cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning feeling in the mouth one of my favorite things about this tea i'm not a huge tea drinker but i really enjoy this in winter it 's great for mulling things as well apples pears and wine my only complaint is that it is not 100 reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added but it 's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening makes me miss seattle wa and pike place market	2
1	i felt like i was at the movies when i received this gift basket as a present along with the movie man on fire plenty to share with friends family or keep for yourself while watching a good trilog	2
1	this green curry is really really good the only thing that would make it 5 stars would be a few more vegetables but the flavor is excellent nice and spicy	2

1	i'm very pleased with this tea i boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature which is around 200 degrees fahrenheit i let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice light oolong it 's good and relaxing arrived in the container seen in the picture with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it i 'd recommend it	2

1	received my vanilla beans very quickly they arrived fresh sealed well and exactly as we 'd hoped	2
1	i loved the vanilla beans sent by jr mushrooms they price was great and the quality was equal to more expensive beans	2
1	i was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever i was rather suspicious of the orange grapefruit and other extra 'scents' however i was delighted with the concoction the extras are definately present giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique aroma that is quite pleasing i do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique	2
1	i first had this tea served at the firebird resturant in new york they served it in traditional russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from moldavia \( no sugar \) this is by far the best way to enjoy this fine tea but even when i'm in less civilized parts of the country prince vladimir with a spoonful of sugar is wonderful	2
1	i have used this flask for about a month now i absolutely love it ! i purchased this based on the reputation of the bodum brand i have never had a problem with any kind of leakage or spillage it has tipped over before with no problems i highly recommend this for anyone	2
1	people are always focusing on the 2 but what about the 98 \? i mean really 98 is like a 790 on the sat or an a in school or a 3 99 on a 4 00 scale a 98 is really really good just like this milk the 128 oz of tuscan 2 milk in the plastic jug but you gotta wonder about the price i mean they get the cream for the butter right \? you gave up some of your whole milk delights for someone else 's butter so i think we should get a price break or something or maybe some kind of gift certificate when tuscan butter is finally available online	2
1	tuscan tuscan milkhusky tuscan milklarge and in chargemakes the other milks cryi'm not telling you why from out of cow nipplesit creamily ripplesinto our hearts tuscan tuscanmil	2
1	finally a healthy alternative to tuscan whole milk there are those who will say that the milk of the 2 cow is somehow inferior to that of the larger whole cow to them i say hooey ! this milk is nearly 49 as tasty as tuscan whole milk my doctor recently told me i 'd have to give up tuscan whole milk due to my high cholesterol after some angry surfing i came upon amazon 's literally life saving alternative this magical elixir is nearly as potent and best of all no sales tax and super saver shipping ! i can wait a week for my milk amazon just keep giving me that great tuscan 2 milky goodness	2
1	nothing says 'taste of italy' like a gallon of tuscan 's finest the aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course even veal ! it 's even great paired with dessert ! do n't be fooled by cheap imitations folks this is the real thing ! remember if it 's tuscan it 's kosher ! now with extra whiteness	2
1	look nothing is better when it comes to a liquid substance my gay lover and i tried the whole milk first but i fear it was too thick there was no motion in our ocean ! so i switched to the 2 and everything is peachy when we get thirsty we just pop the cork open and take a swig when sweaty we leave the cork off and roll around and let the milk cover our bodies ! ahhh tuscan milk	2
1	it caresses the inside of my mouth like the sinuous tongue of my beloved	2
1	everything was as expected fast delivery it is a good gift for any occasion	2
1	i 've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best ! ! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter the moka java is delicious	2
1	i tried making my own fondant 3 times with no success trying to stir the muck recipe books told me to make broke every wooden spoon i had this is so easy ! the instructions are right on the bag you just add it to melted butter ! so simple much easier than everything i have tried in the past if you want to make your own candy this is what you need save a wooden spoon buy dry fondant today	2
1	this chocolate was great the first time i used a fondue fountain i used chocolate chips i had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot then add oil to it in order to use it i ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing then someone told me about using liquid chocolate it was so much easier you just have to pour it in and the taste was amazing if i didnt find this i probably would never have used my fountain again	2
1	this chocolate has ruined me for any other if you like the dove dark chocolate candy you will love this it 's smooth and creamy like drinking a dark chocolate bar and it 's not fattening only 100 calories dissolved in 1 3 c milk yet it seems to make about 1 2 cup that 's all you need it 's rich filling and very satisfying i just wish amazon had the complete list of products this is not for people that like hershey 's chocolate !	2
1	being french these have always been one of my favorites the reviewer before me obviously did n't know how to cook these so hear you must bake them in the oven until they crack open and even then let them get slightly burnt the crispy blackened parts are always everyone 's favorites ! these sausages are very tasty and highly nutritious while low fat \( compared to regular sausages \) so give them a try ! ! the best side dish to go with these is either mashed potatoes or un sweetened fresh applesauce \( delicieux ! \) enjoy	2
1	these are not for weight control but are very diabetic friendly it is so nice to once again be able to enjoy one of my favorite cookies and keep control of my blood sugar if you are a diabetic and loved oreo 's i recommend trying these	2
1	i eat popcorn all the time and have used this salt for a couple of years i disagree that it has a chemical taste but taste is always pretty subjective if you like alternatives to salt give it a try	2
1	these steaks were tender and tasted very good so good in fact we ordered more	2
1	i recently received a shipment of omaha burgers i normally order the filets the burgers were perfect size for a hamburger bun they are pre formed and uniformly sized that way they 're all done cooking at the same time the ground beef was high quality and did n't shrink at all and the burgers had full flavor they are a little pricey for burgers but i will order them again for their quality they 're perfect when having a small group of friends over for a cookout	2
1	wonderful for eating as a snack right out of the can or in cereal not hard little rock like things but real blueblueberries	2
1	i sent this coffee to two friends back east they thoroughly enjoyed getting it and said it was delicious	2
1	this is my favorite starbucks roast but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff plus they will grind it for you there	2
1	it 's interesting when you find out that tapioca pearls are actually those little bubbly round things you find in pudding they are really good this is a great product i recommend it	2
1	i'm definitely a satisfied customer my dhl package got to me damaged and the box was wet the bubble tea customer service representatives where wonderful about replacing it i will buy from them again ! they have excellent customer service in my book ! thanks ange	2
1	i received my package via ups in a reasonable amount of time the coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful but not fake tasting however i did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use for some reason a couple of cups came out really weak so i referred to the senseo handbook for a hint now when i put a pod in i make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly that seems to have solved the problem	2
1	this one caught us by surprise ! we do n't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it 's really good ! we love the way it smells the way it tastes and the fact it is just plain different most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent and it 's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee meaning a rich chocolate and raspberry flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good singleservecoffee co	2

1	this popcorn oil does indeed make your popcorn taste like theater popcorn it is simple and easy to use i use it in my whirley pop stovetop popper and my popcorn comes out perfect every time my family and friends love it	2
1	gives a really nice taste to popcorn i was n't expecting it to be solid looks more like shortening than oil but it does taste good you can smell the coconut oil tastes like theater popcorn	2
1	this product really does work especially in the stir crazy popper it makes crunchy popcorn every time	2
1	having lived in what i consider the coffee capitol of the united states portland i am confident in my personal assertion that torrefazione italia was the finest coffee shop out there the environment was warm and exotic while the coffee was second to none poured by authentic baristas now that these coffee shops have been closed by starbucks i am thrilled to still be able to purchase the beans here on amazon give them a try and i bet you wo n't go back to whatever it is that you are drinking now	2
1	just received this set today and i'm already on my second cup i ca n't wait to show our dinner guests this set so they can feel like they are dining in a 5 star restaurant	2

1	bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we 've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes this is a reasonably priced nice sized sample to use 5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1 oz packet of powder but luckily i had a gift certificate i look forward to trying different recipes with this cheesecake tastes good a lot earthier more organic now that we have the real matcha i think i 'll try making iced lattes now too bad it did n't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too	2
1	i use this powder to make the jamba juice equivalent of the matcha green tea blast it does a great job in reproducing the taste i 'd recommend this supplier	2
1	my recipe for iced green tea latte 1 teaspoon \( approx 4 gms \) green tea powder a pinch \( 1gm \) of soy protein powder 1 tablespoon sugar mix with 1 tablespoon hot water and let seep for 2 mins add milk \( 8 10 oz \) and ice	2

1	marmite is great its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you 'd been walking around in an old factory for a day i think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world thank god they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth	2
1	marmite is the greatest thing since sliced bread it is the thing that most ex pats miss but it is most definitely not vegemite that is an entirely different thing well not that entirely different maybe but to my mind marmite is far superior it tastes 'meatier' is a glorious glossy brown black colour comes in a much nicer jar and makes a lovely drink 1 teaspoon in a mug of hot water in which you dunk thick slices of buttered bread lived on this when a poor student	2
1	this contains no corn whoo hooo finally i can have vanilla bean extract with no alcohol derived from corn or corn syrup corn takes away from the flavor of natural vanilla this is the best vanilla extract out there you have to try it	2

1	a 2 pack is much better at filling the void than a one pack plus cucumbers are full of water for rehydration	2
1	oh how i love the most delicious incredible edible fruit of the plant cucumis sativus who would 've thought that this was a member of the gourd family cucurbitaceae a cousin of the melon \? cucumbers have many great uses they 're delicious in salads and is there any snack tastier than a pickle \? i also hear they have non culinary uses as well some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes maybe that 's because they 're 90 water i 've also heard that there are more adult uses for the cucumber but i 've only seen that in movies	2
1	hard to imagine something could make one 's honey even sweeter but this fills the bill the little jars make it easy for you to try different flavors \( as opposed to being stuck with a large quantity of one \) all of them were quite yummy too the only thing i would change is the brush that 's included it 's tiny which makes it fun to tease and do little bits at a time but it could be just a bit broader the bristles tend to get overwhelmed by the chocolate then you just use your fingers	2
1	i was treated to this sauce while in canada for a friends wedding recently i have to say it is easily the best steak brown sauce i 've ever had it 's sweet and tangy and spicy all at the same time but not overpoweringly so the sauce seems extremely versatile and would be excellent over steak poultry burgers fries and i'm sure would be a fantastic marinade as well	2
1	it has become so hard to find hp sauce where i live in california in the last few years i have no idea why it is scrumptious and i'm thinking of opening my own hp only franchise outlet ! \(	2

1	the crema was pretty thick as it brewed and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color we got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk \( 1 \) and sugar our first impressions good flavor a nice cup of coffee we did enjoy the cup of coffeewe do n't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it 's really good ! we love the way it smells the way it tastes and the fact it is just plain different most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent and it 's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee ! review from singleservecoffee com	2
1	when we traveled in belgium some years ago we were constantly tempted by chocolate there was a godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates someone suggested we try leonidas and it was a revelation ! ! half the price of godiva 's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now the flavors were more interesting the finish more refined and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth leonidas is it as far as belgian chocolates are concerned	2
1	if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend	2

1	these kona pods are the highest quality pods that i have found yet i love kona coffee so i was extremely pleased to find these pods they certainly cost a little more than other cheap pods but it 's worth it especially when you consider what you pay for a cup of coffee at retail now i have the best coffee in the world at home for less	2
1	yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free there are technical issues with the pods 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work \( i have black decker home cafe machine \) great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it i also feel that to charage 15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi	2
1	fabulous marriage of convenience and quality rich full flavor from the touch of a button ! a dream come true	2
1	my son's inlaws raved at the hamburgers and steaks i was verypleased with the price and promp delivery both excellent thankyou for the availability	2

1	if you are looking for matcha green tea powder in mass at a great price this is it	2
1	teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that this is a moderately price matcha tea so do n't except the best flavor it is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks desserts broth etc real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet if you do n't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice	2
1	my husband loved receiving this package in front of his co workers there was hardly anything left when he came home from work the packaging was beautifully done and everything was delicious that he received all of his co workers wanted to know who the company was i e mailed them the name of the company so i am so sure they will probably order for easter i know i will you should too for friends relatives retirement homes and anyone you can think of the company is very responsive and takes care of its customers down to the last detail	2
1	adagio has outdone themselves with this creation jasmine bloom display tea starts out as a tight ball of leaves the size of a quarter add some hot water and the ball unfurls it 's leaves of jasmine green tea revealing a strand of delicate white flowers arching over the green tea starburst the aroma is a delicate perfumed scent of jasmine blossoms the color is a pale green and the taste is light and mellow the hand tied tea blooms are nicer to look at than taste however i recommend trying this tea just for the fun of it	2

1	these strawberry wheels are very fresh and delicious i highly recommend them	2
1	almond flour is an excellent way to make your favorite carb loaded products much healthier and the 5 pound bag is much more convenient and far cheaper than buying 1 pound bags at the grocery store	2
1	our son is on a gluten free diet and almond flour is a daily staple pancakes muffins breading for chicken shrimp well worth every penny i like how finely ground this one is	2
1	i 've tried this and it seems to be both better and cheaper than bob 's red mill brand buying it like this brings the total price down to around 7 40 per bag the best deal for people needing to replace the regular flour in their diet the only thing i can suggest is to carefully store this flour as it can go stale before you use it all i would suggest a good glass or heavy plastic sealable container which can go in the fridge also you can buy this directly from honeyville for cheaper	2
1	it was great but i don't think the price was near what i'd be willing to spend again price was way to high sincerelyjeanne higgins	2
1	and at my age that is saying something i have a bunn my cafe that i purchased on amazon and after i received it i bought some aloha island pods they are all wonderful but the lava java is fabulous i like a darker roast coffee with a lot of flavor but i do not want it to taste smokey or burned i will continue to order this amazing variety along with a couple others from aloha island they are more expensive than some others but if coffee is important to you then treat yourself to these pods you will not regret it	2

1	i was first introduced to this tea at starbucks they marketed it as shaken passion tea it tastes great when served hot but when iced it really shines bear in mind that this is a herabl infusion and not a traditional tea the color is a deep ruby red and the taste it is indescribable when served slightly sweet with a spring of mint it is the perfect summer refresher if you want a break from traditional black or green teas or are watching your caffeiene intake this is the perfect subsitution	2

1	in my experiences with indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native indian folks this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar it 's nice to be able to open a package of indian food to eat with some basmati rice quickly recommended some of the flavors are spicy	2

1	i have been impressed by tazo 's china green tips tea strong is an understatement ! great tea i have throughly enjoyed i	2
1	this is by far the most enjoyable hot chocolate i 've ever come across for consumer purchase it is high in calories and expensive but if you are looking for a rich comforting cup of chocolate this is it this hot chocolate is thick and delicious in the european sense yet not overly sweet as many american brands are unfortunately mariebelle is neither organic nor fair trade but if that is not important to you then there is no downside i 've found no other maker produces a finer cup of chocolate save the city bakery in nyc which is the next best thing to parisian hot chocolate	2

1	i'm a fanatic for gummy candy especially the sour kind but most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment and most apple and \( especially \) apricot fruit \( ish \) rings taste artificial too haribo does a much better job their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until i discovered these apple ones they taste natural real healthy apple flavor less stridently sour than grapefruit now it 's a tie for top place apple and grapefruit when i ca n't decide i eat 'em both together my dentist taught me that trick believe it or not i sometimes wonder whose side she 's on	2
1	i really love this tea it is my every morning tea it has the very green \( fresh \) taste of the tea served in japan that is distinctive of japanese tea alone for this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of chinese green tea and there is a big difference between the two because its flavor is definitely characteristic of japanese green tea the color is beautiful almost as green as the twice as expensive gyokuro variety i have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price	2
1	i agree with the other reviewer in terms of shipping our basket arrived 2 weeks after ordering also however i have ordered other baskets from them and it only took a few days to arrive either way the basket was well worth the wait it has a large variety of items and they all taste great ! if you can order ahead of time you wo n't go wrong with this basket	2
1	it is an enjoyment just by opening the cover of the container ! a delicate fresh jasmine a great delicious tea ! the tea is arrived in the container seen in the picture with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it make about 20 40 servings depends on how strong you like it	2
1	truly a unique spice which used sparingly adds a real zest to meat and poultry dishes a wonderful addition to a spice collection colett	2
1	the green tea is excellent \( and it should be considering the cost for such as small amount ! \) i have to admit i was shocked when i received the tiny little tin the picture is deceiving you think you are getting a huge amount but you only need a small amount very smooth overall it is worth it i highly recommend this tea if you 're willing to dish out the cash	2
1	i know it sounds a little more pricey than the other green teas but this one is smooth and not bitter at all i put it in soymilk like the matcha shots you can get at some juice stores it 's refreshing	2
1	i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted if you 'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat	2
1	i bought this for me and my wife and the tea is very good i tasted some green teas but this one is probably one of the best ones ive tasted	2
1	i love the bright green color after i add hot water to the green tea powder i whip it with a whisk set it in the refrigerator to cool and the add a few drops of liquid stevia to sweeten it a little it looks a little strange but has a good taste	2
1	i 've tried a number of brands and both loose and bagged tea and this was quite delicious although it 's unsmoked it has a rich smoky flavor that 's quite satisfying	2
1	i 've never been a big soy eater until recently i have started trying to eat healthier avoiding white flour sugar etc well so i bought this product in order to have some baked foods around like muffins stuff it is really good when used as a substitute for white flour and our whole family is happy with the stuff i am baking ! \)	2
1	for those of us wanting to eat healthier and a little less carbolicious this pasta is really good it is difficult to tell the difference except this pasta has a bit more texture to it but hey it 's good and to me that 's all that matters i stocked up	2
1	and this little gadget does the job much better than a melitta style funnel and paper filter if you grind your own you 'll need to experiment a bit with how fine to grind and how tight to screw down the tamper but after a few tries you should have the cup of coffee you want i have 4 now they are pretty cool for serving coffee when you have company i do n't think the online price is outrageous but if you are lucky enough to live in a city with a vietnamese market you can pick these up for 3 each	2
1	this is very good peanut brittle i found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free in fact i found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle i have eaten most peanut brittle is hard as a rock this brand had a perfect crisp crunch	2
1	for a bag tea which generally are not as good quality this brews up like a top quality loose tea it 's a delicious snappy black blend with a lovely scent and taste one of my favorites	2
1	the taste of maruchan roast chicken flavor ramen noodle soup \( 3 oz \) is not chicken my friends oh no it is the taste of death itself recommend	2
1	man when it 's the end of the month and there is no food in the fridge i like to cook up a hot pot of ramen noodles i just boil those noodles and hook it up with canned pork tuna cheese green beans tomatoes lima beans or pig feet the best way to eat ramen noodles is to pour a lot of hot sauce on top of it mm ! mm ! good ! a hot bowl of ramen noodles on a cold rainy day at the end of the month makes me feel good inside it feels you right up my favorite flavors are beef roasted chicken and scrimp	2
1	the lovely thing about ramen noodles is that they take three minutes to cook and three minutes to eat and one does n't usually find themselves wanting to vomit afterwards they 're dirt cheap and their convenience does n't impede upon the taste which is always a plus	2
1	this candy is very good and good for you this seller is one of the best i have had contact with also	2
1	i have used only two bottles of this sauce over a period of years i enjoy hot sauce on my food but this one can only be used on large quantities i use it mostly with chili one small drop not dash in a big bowl will have tears flowing from your eyes ! if you like it hot ! this is the sauce for you	2

1	i started eating quaker oat bran 2 years ago because i wanted a cereal that is high in fiber and protein yet low in sugar it is so good as a cereal with milk and it stays crunchy it also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit it reminds me a little of chex cereal or life cereal but it is much healthier and substantial i have not found any cereal i like better now my kids love it too i ca n't keep enough of it in the house and i prefer this cereal to quaker oats squares which are made of larger squares	2

1	unlike other oriental noodles you buy this product has superb flavors and great noodle quality that does not break down the vegetables taste like vegatables and there is not a lame aftertaste like some noodle packets bought in stores price is a little high but you get what you pay for quality	2
1	thai tea is a wonderful exotic drink with deep flavors and vibrant overtones almost a dessert but can quickly cool your month down after fiery thai entrees pacificrim gourmet also offers another brand of thai tea which is less expensive and yields more tea per package and some argue is more authentic both are very good ordering the products are easy and delivery was quick and not as expensive as some other on line vendors	2

1	these freeze dried strawberries are fabulous i use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping most recently i 've chopped them up and added them to a batch of rice krispy treats \( receiving rave reviews in the process ! \) they 're also great to snack on plain they have a light crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately although 8 ounces does n't sound like much you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter than air strawberries i recommend this item highly	2
1	i was skeptical at first as to how good freeze dried strawberries could be but they taste great like fresh picked strawberries	2
1	great product and great service my 2 year old son loves the strawberry and they make a good healthy snack	2
1	these are the best berries i 've ever tasted ! i thought for sure they were sweetened but they 're not the berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them additionally the slices are whole with very little breakage in the can the value you get is pretty great considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5 of fresh strawberries at 3 lb \( shipping \) that 's really not bad and you can have these year round even when strawberries are n't in season	2
1	these strawberries are great they are great on cereal the price is fantastic my kids had some freeze dried berries at a space center but they were much more expensive these are a steal i am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price	2

1	i loved their wagashi ! not easy to find in the midwest this was a great purchase ! ordered on monday arrived on thursday still cold would definitely order again	2
1	we were thrilled to find an online source for wagashi mochi desserts we love japanese desserts but because we do n't live in new york or california we have a very hard time getting our hands on any so when we found these we ordered right away they arrived promptly and well packaged and tasted absolutely wonderful though a bit pricy after adding the speedy shipping they really were wonderful it 's not too hard to make plain old daifuku but when you crave the fancier stuff this is the way to go	2

1	regular hershey 's kisses have always tasted great but when i tried this flavor it was an eye opener the cherry flavor in the center makes me think of my mom 's favorite chocolate covered cherries of the 1950s those were always considered too expensive and grown up for us kids to eat now i can have cherry cordial kisses whenever i want unfortunately they do n't last long around my house treat yourself	2

1	wonderful it could only be improved if it came with a packet of rice like the other entrees do	2
1	in my experiences with indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native indian folks this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar it 's nice to be able to open a package of indian food to eat with some basmati rice quickly recommended some of the flavors are spicy	2
1	add a can of chick peas garbonzo beans and you can give this entree 6 stars makes it look a bit more appealing too	2
1	i love this stuff i have a 12 pack at my office when i ca n't get out for lunch 90 seconds in the microwave and i'm eating	2
1	one of my favorites as good as it gets for what it is \( prepackaged indian food \) the flavor is authentic and preparation is easy best mixed with basmati rice i recommend adding chopped fresh coriander \( cilantro \) you might want to add a dollop of yogurt if you have a low tolerance for hot spice	2
1	very good soup easy to make and brings latin american flavors to life works well with any meal my only complaint is that it clumped after letting it sit for a minute so i had to stir it quite often but overall a delicious soup that i will continue to buy enjoy	2
1	i just made this soup for the first time and it could not have been easier add water heat and then garnish with a little cheese i did n't find it terribly spicy hot the chiles used are nice and mild a tasty dinner indeed	2

1	i 've been buying these freeze dried strawberries for several months and use them mainly in my cereal they are delicious and consistantly high quality i have only had one can with what seemed like excessive strawberry powder at the bottom	2
1	after years of nothing but illy pods which are very good it was nice to branch out and try some other brands the variety pack is a fun way to do that i give it 5 stars because it is as advertised the coffees are good some are better than others you 'll find your favorites and it is also nice to have a variety of decafs in the house illy is still a staple though	2
1	i purchased this for an oktoberfest party there was a lot left over mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk the sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way i 'd recommend this to anyone who does n't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity there are several little flats of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough	2

1	if you like smashing things this does the job nicely i smiled taking it out of the box it is quite heavy and large very nice open bowl with large capacity i highly recommend this as a workhorse warning you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy but this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities	2

1	my diet requires that i eat less sugar so i'm constantly trying sugar free products i 've always loved the jelly belly brand and the sugar free beans are a great alternative my favorite flavor by far is buttered popcorn and it tastes almost exactly the same as the orginal the only thing is the outer shell is a bit harder than the traditional bean but for someone who is picky it was n't enough to bother me it is lower in calories but watch what you eat because it still has carbohydrates just like anything else i would recommend this product to anyone	2

1	i bought both the 50 flavor gift box and the bean blast basket for corporate christmas gifts the basket was much more expensive and did n't have nearly the wow value of this 50 flavor gift box it 's shaped like a monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift it 's also reasonably priced at around 15 of course the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves this is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself	2
1	jelly bellies are the gourmet version of the jelly bean they are unique because of the variety of flavors and the ease with which you can recognize flavors even better there are combinations of jelly bellies that can yield even more flavors jelly bellies are small but they are packed with a great flavor jelly bellies are a special treat and while there are not an every day snack i love to indulge upon occasion they are worth every penny each time i splurge to get them enjoy !	2
1	i'm a huge fan of jelly belly jelly beans so i really enjoyed this gift box of 50 different kinds ! my favorite is definitely tangerine but it 's always a treat to try new and different flavors this box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which so you can avoid the ones you dislike \( for me peanut butter jelly beans gag ! \) it 's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price jelly bellies have never been cheap ! it 's well worth the cost though and a great gift this year for christmas	2
1	this stuff tastes just like sweettarts i recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it	2
1	this is a great linguisa ! i usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'hot' chorizo sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot' and they are organic the fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it 's high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs and the price is good too free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy i highly recommend it	2
1	i 've seen that they are referred to as licorice with a cream filling they kinda have that texture but not at all that flavor much more like a fruit roll up with a sugary cream inside i like them	2
1	i got a back of pico balla in germany a couple of years ago and keep coming back to it ! good stuff haribo is the gold standard for gummi candy and this particular type is really good	2
1	the government wo n't let us get the real thing from scotland so this is the next best thing does n't taste like canned haggis from scotland but no one at our burn 's night party knows that	2
1	i first picked this tea up in paris at the bon marche department store food halls \( le grand epicerie de paris \) on returning to the states and trying the tea i was most impressed redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk it is now my favorite tea enjoy	2
1	the cocoa is of superior quality as is all dean deluca products	2
1	besides being a very good deal for the price this item thankfully does not contain lavender which is not commonly used in french cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests however the classic mix of herbes de provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb marjoram	2
1	spelt has quickly become a favorite staple for me these berries are great tasting and easy to work with not to mention their nutritional value	2
1	this tea gives you the flavor of the japanese way of tea ceremony a beautiful fragrance and taste be sure to prepare it in the traditional way arigato to maeda en a great matcha ron	2
1	good product that 's good for you packaged to last forever only way it would be better is if it came with a quarter cup scoop	2
1	the product arrived on time and as advertised the oats were nearly as good as mccanns and quite a bit less expensive you just have to be careful not to overcook them as they get a little mushy if overdone	2
1	tastes like oatmeal only chunkier i like mine breads and cereals crunchier so this was right up my alley takes about 25 minutes to cook but overall i like it	2
1	this is the best oatmeal i 've ever eaten we cook it overnight in a small crockpot a quick hot breakfast the next morning ! you can add things to it for endless variations	2
1	i thought this salt tasted pretty good until it occurred to me i go to the bathroom everytime i take a swim	2
1	try them you 'll like them yes it 's that simple \) these taste slightly different than most gummis but in a good way	2

1	the product was as described i just did n't realize that i was ordering from an exclusive chocolate store in new york city ! the candies were 2 50 and the shipping was four times that much ! \( i had it mailed to a u s address not my address in brazil in case you 're wondering	2
1	what can i say the order was fulfilled to my satisfaction nothing beyond that needs be said thanksjoan kersha	2
1	this stuff is great ! healthier and tastier than any other pasta that i 've tried \( except for my mother in laws homemade \)	2
1	i 've been a fan of dave 's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception the initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless and then the fun begins a slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering what did i just do \? want some more fun \? offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement while not as heat intensive as his insanity sauces ranking only half way up his thermometer scale it 's still got a little bit of punch to it with it 's five different peppers who would 've though olives could be this much fun	2
1	my favorite coffee by far however it is a little too expensive for me to drink it regularly \( i drink a lot of coffee	2
1	i love this coffee and drink it nearly everyday it is my way of pampering myself although it 's rather expensive godiva chocolate coffee with milk is something i look forward to drinking in a polka dotted mug somehow the cold winters of new england become more cheerful	2
1	my wife wanted me to order this coffee since she is the coffee drinker in the house she just loves this coffee the company is excellent to deal with the price was right and they shipped my order extremely fast i did n't expect to get it that quick i highly recommend this company also keep up the great work bruc	2

1	delicious can't tell the difference between regular pasta and this product except i am losing weight so it must not be affecting my blood sugar	2
1	we visited the south of france during the summer spent time with our friends who live there they made us the most delicious dinner one evening using these bricks they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball thyme then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes i was obsessed with finding these bricks i went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail finally on amazon i found them ! whew i did n't want to have to travel all the way back to france to get them !	2
1	very yummy potatoes \( and chick peas \) very tasty and not too spicy hot i recommend it highly as a side dish or over a dead animal or rice so easy to make boil water warm in packet under water for about 5 minutes carefully lift out of water grip rip pour	2
1	the bombay potatoes are a great way to reduce my intake of meat especially while dieting if you crave a spicy delicious and different flavor these are for you ! love them	2
1	could use more flavor but otherwise an acceptable piece of instant food just cook some rice and pour this on top of the hot rice and your all set its got all your protein and carb needs for a meal	2
1	definitely a quick and easy entree authentic \( according to my experience \) indian cuisine but too spicey hot for my taste	2
1	not bad very flavorful good nutrition low cal and vegan i 'd probably puchase it again	2
1	what do you think of foodwise when you go camping \? well besides the case of beer you have the dogs and the marshmallows ! nothing like roasting these suckers over an open fire or just pop them in your mouth from the bad soft and fluffy these suckers do n't get hard and stale as quickly as other brands do definately a great product	2
1	this is the best candy i have ever had my aunt gave everybody at christmas this candy in a red box what a great gift it does n't help my atkins diet but i 've got to have my chocolate	2
1	out of all of the new flavors of hershey kisses hitting the shelves these days the cherry cordial flavor is by far the best ! my daughter and i both agree what a pleasant surprise to find them on amazon ! we were able to buy them in the store from before christmas until valentine 's day and then they just disappeared how sad but glad to see they can be bought online	2
1	the taste of these cherry flavored hershey kisses is very very good my kids also commented on how tasty they were and ate them first out of their christmas stocking candy i will definitely buy them again	2
1	i bought these for my dad at christmas and he just loves the taste you ca n't go wrong with a kiss	2
1	i'm really picky when it comes to chocolate covered cherries i do n't care too much for the dime store variety so i was n't sure what to expect when my mother handed me a hershey cherry cordial kiss to try but from the first bite i was hooked ! they taste exactly like the expensive brands i 've come to love and at a fraction of the price ! if you like chocolate covered cherries you just ca n't go wrong with this product ! these kisses are unbelievably good ! !	2
1	this product is amazing not only did i get a very good tasting product but i also got a hand written note and a free sample of candy made fresh by das foods i also purchased the lava salt with the same reaction i would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for one of those different seasonings for their food	2
1	this product was an excellent price for a quality product shipping was much quicker than expected and came with a hand written note on the envoice the holiday shipping did not deter this company from providing first class service it would be a pleasure to order from them again	2

1	i purchased this item as a gift for a monkey lover i thought this product was awsome creative and equally unique from any of the other monkey items i found over the internet	2
1	in the midwest some folks think of this as biscotti but do n't be confused it is correctly named it is a toast cookie so when you dunk it be quick about it ! my husbands favorite and quite tasty i like the small almond bits and that i can chew it without dunking \( not at hard as their biscotti see my review \)	2
1	in my experiences with indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native indian folks this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar it 's nice to be able to open a package of indian food to eat with some basmati rice quickly recommended some of the flavors are spicy	2
1	this is a delicious basic thai yellow curry with some vegetables it comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal but i still found that with this meal i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes nuts or eggplant i do n't have any thai places in my area so i add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that thai craving the sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	2
1	i was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers i said no problem then i tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area \( sacramento \) could n't find it thank goodness for the perfect puree of napa valley the passion fruit puree came frozen thawed beautifuly and tasted fantastic what a great product	2
1	this is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves sadly they disappeared from the shelves after an extensive internet search for the product i was able to find them through amazon com and gristede 's supermarket i ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised when these are gone i will certainly use this same procedure to order more	2
1	my first and last beverage review i am gob smacked by this coffee what 's that complex flavor \? i do n't know but i 've never had better and i 've tried a lot of brands gourmet and not so smooth nutty winey woodsy whatever who cares i love it maybe it 's all that caffeine racing through my veins \( i'm on my third cup \) but i'm about ready to dance and break into song a polka would be nice plus the fact that it 's dedicated to a cat is extremely sweet and they practice social and environmental responsibility with their growers way to go seattle	2
1	i have been faithfully buying omaha steaks products for years in my grocer 's freezer and my butcher there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers you get what you pay for this company delivers consistent quality again and again i think other reviewers of omaha steaks product do n't know how to use their grill if you follow the step by step instructions presto perfect taste every time	2
1	this tea while a bit pricey is excellent hint of jasmine and full aroma make this tea a good choice for a special occasio	2
1	the vanilla beans arrived still moist and plump they 're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at whole foods or wild oats which are very dry and shriveled by comparison not to mention overpriced the fragrance is overpowering and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee do n't throw away your used vanilla pods ! save them to flavor your sugar	2
1	first of all wow instant noodles for sale on amazon \? second excellent decision on selling nongshim 's shin ramen nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen 's trademark spicyness and deliciosity not as filling as the non cup version \( which you have to cook over a stove \) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied for three hours until you get hungry for more shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion	2
1	man i 've lived all over the world and while most think that ramen is a poor college student 's meal is missing out after a few months of life in korea i could n't get enough of the stuff i'm glad to see that it is finally being offered by amazon i now can get a good book and some tasty spicy ramen life is good	2
1	much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets ! i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs not worth the cost ! this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies ideally i 'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past ! it also comes in a very nice basket which is great to re use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage	2
1	the original is my favorite but my wife hates it she likes the green tea chai latte which i do n't care for unfortunately reviews will be of little help since taste varies but the product is recommended	2
1	i hate to use this word but this product truly is orgasmic it comes out perfect cup after cup having a creamy yet zingy taste the first time i tried it was at einstein bros bagels \( the use the concentrate themselves to create quot their quot chai tea latte \) when i first tried this i exclaimed to myself quot wow ! ! ! ! quot any person i have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy mr oregon chai tea latte concentrate thank you	2
1	if you like them small you wo n't be disappointed tasty though i would upgrade to the bigger ones	2
1	i have always wanted to like greent tea but never been able to my sister gave me a cup of this tea at her house and i was completely won over it 's taste is so smooth with the mild sweetness of jasmine my husband and i have successfully quit coffee thanks to this tea	2
1	i 've used this to produce batch after batch of great sprouts with no issues the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the instructions are confusing and contradictory	2
1	the matcha tea is exactly what i expected extremely green great flavor keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea \( starbucks etc \) it was great got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery highly recommend this seller	2
1	bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we 've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes this is a reasonably priced nice sized sample to use 5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1 oz packet of powder but luckily i had a gift certificate i look forward to trying different recipes with this cheesecake tastes good a lot earthier more organic now that we have the real matcha i think i 'll try making iced lattes now too bad it did n't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too	2
1	i use this powder to make the jamba juice equivalent of the matcha green tea blast it does a great job in reproducing the taste i 'd recommend this supplier	2
1	this product was exactly what i had hoped for as i was coming across recipes that called for matcha powder it worked perfect and makes an excellent cup of tea \( a little goes a long way i definately feel i got my moneys worth \) try it in panna cotta	2
1	it 's just like you had in europe or latin america and it they send it pretty quickly as you probably know if you 're ordering it it 's delicious for cooking coffee uses and slightly nasty for everything else	2
1	the chipotle sauce is one my favorite chipotle sauces because of its emphasis on the smokey flavor it 's also sweet which blends well with the smokiness i am a fan of the chipotle chile so i'm glad of their growth in popularity	2
1	bakel 's pettinice rolled fondant imported from new zealand is one of the favorite choices for pastry chefs \( both amateur professional \) worldwide it 's available in white ivory or chocolate and can be purchased in resealable 15 lb tubs or 5 lb packages fondant can be flavored with small amounts of various flavoring compounds e g chocolate pure extracts concentrated food coloring provides you with nearly a limitless spectrum of coloring options the 15 lb tub should retail around 44 99 \( plus shipping \) and the 5 lb package should retail around 16 99 \( plus shipping \)	2

1	now i'm all in favor of hershey 's kisses but you look at this guy here and you kind of have to wonder i mean who buys 25 lbs of individually packaged chocolate count chocula on a bender \? perennial halloween door answerers preparing for the apocalypse \? let 's face it this is the ultimate milk chocolate and tinfoil experience i just hope you 're ready for it	2
1	this is the best gluten free item i have found so far this mix makes the best tasting waffles and pancakes with a great texture even non celiac friends and family like to eat these thank you pamela for making gluten free food taste good	2
1	my husband a non celiac eat this pancake mix \( to make waffles \) all the time the recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff so it is a bit more work than many other mixes but it is worth it ! the result tastes like real waffles kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles but the texture is n't as nice	2
1	this foie gras is some of the very best we have had my parents live in france and they know how we love foie gras so they order some each year for our anniversary this selection is the best by far that we have had state side i have to say that we had lots of foie gras on our visits to france and this stuff can compete ! it was mouth watering and a very generous portion size plan to buy more	2

1	i have n't been able to find this product in my local grocery stores when i found it online through amazon i was delighted i ordered 10 packages they are all gone i love them especially to dunk in my morning coffee if you have n't ever tried them do so you will love them	2

1	stella d'ora breakfast treats patton oswallt loves 'em and so do i	2
1	this is one of my faves of the vosges line the flavors are interstingly good and make it worth the price tag for a personal indulgence or fun gift	2
1	i heard how good the haribo brand was and decided to give it a try amazon was out of stock of the regular gummi bears and i did n't want to wait so these looked like the next best thing now i am hooked and plan on buying more when my 5 lb bag runs out	2
1	haribo makes the best gummys and these are slightly different from the standard flavors nice and big for a satisfying mouth feel too	2
1	i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts	2
1	i am new to the world of gourmet salts and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago ! the granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel but that is where the similiarities end the salt dissolves instantly on the tongue it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste the jar suggests it be used on grilled fish and salads but i would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also	2
1	okay 10 for a potholder \? yeah seems like a lot but you will never be sorry for this purchase better yet give them as a hostess gift and you will be the talk of the party ! i have used my and searched for them like a remote control ! trust me it 's the best gift given or received	2
1	these are not the shriveled scrawny beans you find in a jar in the grocery store they are amazing do n't tell jr but he is n't charging enough !	2
1	these beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers the beans were shipped free and promptly	2
1	first order arrived damaged by the u s post office order was promptly replaced at no charge fast shipping to san franciscodelicious plump fragrant beans excellent product excellent customer service	2

1	i ca n't say enough good things about jr mushrooms these are top quality chef inspired vanilla beans i got them primaraily for my creme brulee another plus was the free shipping which really helps a struggling young chef like myself the only slight dissappointment was that there was no best creme brulee recipe enclosed no problem for me as i 've memorized the procedure i can say this you wo n't be dissappointed by this product use it in whatever calls for vanilla even ice cream	2
1	i love this salt it tastes fantastic i even find myself putting it on things i normally would n't salt i 've gotten my husband to buy me more of the sea salts they are all equally delicious	2
1	first off the company sent me a handwritten thank you note when do you see that in the age of computer print outs i thought it was an extra touch as far as customer service i will be returning to this company again the flavor is omg my best friend is hawaii so i often use the red hawaiian salt this beats its it has a subtle but great flavor i will buy again	2
1	this package is a great way to try a few different types of candies the choclate marbles are like m ms and the jellybeans are well jellybeans the candy that makes this set stand out is the yogurt candy it 's the white one i never knew it was supposed to be yogurt flavored but it makes sense now it 's tangy and sweet and awesome ! i buy these sets just for the yogurt candies when i go to the asian market they 're grrrrrrrrrrrreat	2
1	when i buy produce i expect the farmer to do all the work required to make the product palatable for tomatoes removing the vine is key and must be done amazon should reduce the price for all the time and effort the purchaser must spend on vine removal	2
1	most fruits and vegetables begin to lose a large percentage of their nutritional value minutes after they are plucked from their respective vines or branches there is a synergy of some compounds that have a very short half life after being removed from their home plant when the vine is still attached \( and stilly green and healthy not withered and brittle \) nutrition from the plant is still being pumped into the tomato keeping it firm bright crisp and yummy and more nutritious	2
1	sure it 's not 100 pure vanilla extract that 's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin personally i love its strong distinctive flavor regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is for those who feel it 's too strong use half the amount listed in the recipe i know a couple of people who do this when using molina vanilla again i like the flavor so i use the full amount called for in the recipe this stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch	2
1	a friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to mexico i threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles i had they do not compare to this one it has a strong rich flavor i add to it everything i can my chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without molina vanilla	2
1	had be searching for a source for vanilla with the unique taste this is a good value especially since it saves you the airfare the only thing missing is bargaining with the vendor	2
1	these are really good just like in the uk you 'd think they were caviar from the pricing though	2
1	these crackers are absolutely delicious whether you need to be eating gluten free or not i ca n't getenough of them my favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored these crackers are thin andcrunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a servingonto the cracker i love them alone i love them with tuna fish i 've used them for dipping salsa andguacamole but when i see them all disappearing quickly i hope i have n't used up my last box beingi am gluten intolerant this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when i'm craving something crunchyand flavorful	2
1	a friend introduced me to this coffee and i am addicted i am an avid coffee drinker and this is the best coffee ever i have never been a morning person but this coffee is now the highlight of my morning i look forward to getting up the coffee flavor was not in any way noticable chocolate to me but very sutle i love this coffee	2
1	i have been enjoying this mix for quite some time it is a great gluten free way to satisfy chocolate cravings although the brownies can be a bit on the chewy side i would highly recommend making the cookie recipe shown on the bag it makes really great chocolate cookies definitely the best gluten free ones that i have come across in a mix so far i have even passed these off at holiday parties as regular chocolate cookies and my guests loved them	2
1	i started drinking the bull in earnest in ramadi i was on the quick reaction force and would get a startled awakening at 0 'dark thirty and have to drive a hmmv at 65 mph in the dark with night vision glasses slurping a red bull on the way to the gate seemed to help me wake up and get a grip on the mission it also made me wanna pee	2
1	i 've tried quite a few of the tasty bite products and this one is the best ! what i do with this is mix it with rice one pouch will typically give me 2 meals putting in the fridge the other half for later that day or next day	2
1	i love indian food but my son \( 7 \) is not always as keen on it as i am we 're vegetarian and tried other tasty bite dishes before but none went well until i found agra peas and jodhpur lentils my son was n't sure about the green ness but after explaining it 's just green peas with sauce and coaxing him to try it he now asks for this all this time really ! i think these are a little milder in the exotic flavors and not as hot spicy i suggest these as good choices for first time eaters of indian food and i love how easy it is to warm up	2
1	nicely seasoned creamy texture served over rice one packet makes a generous meal for one or would serve two with something on the side cooked simply by boiling the packet in a pot of water until hot one of relatively few prepared food options where the microwave directions actually require more cleanup than the stovetop option makes a good option for backpacking too assuming the weight is acceptable requires no refrigeration and edible out of the packet with a spoon cold if necessary	2
1	i ordered 4 pounds of rye berries and they were very satisfactory shipment arrived promptly and with no comlications great product !	2
1	tastes just like the red curries you get at a thai restaurant add more or less depending on your spice level not salty at all flavor is great mix with some vegetables tofu and coconut milk to make an amazing thai meal at home	2
1	even if your not on low carb consider this have you ever felt sleepy after eating a high carb meal \? my husband is not overweight yet prefers this pasta because he states does not feel sluggish after eating it honestly can't tell the difference except in how you feel after great product highly recommend it even if you are not watching your weight	2
1	i love this product but when i got the lasagna noodles they were broke in to pieces shipping is very hard on them i will not order them again i do n't think there is to much you can do about this problem christin	2
1	i am a diabetic and i can not eat regular pastas made from refined white flour they boost my sugar up to high because of all the carbs dream fields low carb pasta s has allow me to make and eat pasta again they also taste no different than regular pasta this is a great productwith great taste and low carbs	2
1	i like water but i still like these packets all you do is put the mix in shake it up and it 's lemonade it 's like magic they are perfect for anywhere and they taste good too they are great for traveling i absoulutley love them	2
1	as someone who absolutely hates water crystal light was a life saver for me now that they make it in little packets 'to go ' i can put several in my purse when i go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water i'm doing what doctors suggest we all do drink lots of water yet doing it with something that makes it taste good ! the only complaint i have if you can call it a complaint is that they have n't come out with kiwi strawberry in the individual packets yet that is by far my favorite flavor lemonade comes in a close second i highly recommend this product leanne burroughs author of highland wishes and her highland rogue	2
1	ordered for christmas and it came very quickly was a great gift to give with very quality items in the basket	2
1	i first tried these in south africa now my best friend will ship some to me with packages that she sends on my birthday or other special occasions i love them ! i want to have them here in the states ! ! !	2

1	i love these cookies especially the chocolate chip they are great for a snack and can be quite addicting they are made from all natural ingredients and whole wheat flour the cookies are crispy small animal shapes with a few chocolate chips and not too sweet i do wish the cookies had more chocolate chips but besides that i ca n't get enough of these cookies	2

1	i'm a sucker for underdogs the quiet achievers who never get their due sutah ramen is overshadowed by the market dominance of nongshim 's shin ramen but in my book there is no equal sutah has \( slightly \) thicker noodles more sophisticated spicyness and a richer soup than shin ramen while you ca n't go wrong with shin \( except for the massive dosage of msgs found in all instant food especially ramen \) an spiritual experience awaits with sutah	2
1	i love garlic and have never found a great combination that has few calories and sodium i put it on everything	2
1	i have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago i was horrified this past thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it i tried to improvise with garlic powder and italian seasoning but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past i ca n't say enough great things about this stuff i use it to season burgers steak to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes it 's not just great it 's amazing ! !	2
1	i 've been wanting this for a while now and i finally bought it it looks amazing in my kitchen modern and classic all at the same time and the awesome smell as i was taking it out of the package it made me want to cook dinner ! this is a great gift for anyone	2
1	these guys are definately the best and its easy to see why with thier customer service they worked with me to make sure that my beautiful truffles arrived perfect to the person i was sending them to \( in florida which is a hard place to ship chocolate to ! \) thanks ! ! ! ! i will be reording again seen \) wes	2
1	the best experience for this tea is at the actual pike place market where they brew it so you can sample it in their charming little store past the flying fish and florist it is also really great to have any other time in your life and to share with everyone you meet since every grocery store does n't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen office cabin whatever with it and enjoy	2
1	the flavor of this tea is fantastic ! i received some as a gift from seattle directly and had to find out how to get some more thanks to amazon for carrying this product	2
1	seattle marketspice tea has been my favorite since i was a student at university of washington in 1968 it is spicy sweeet with no sugar great hot or iced i was so happy to find that i can order in on amazon	2
1	i have odered this tea over the internet for years but this is this the first time from this provider the service was a 5 also thank youdian	2
1	i am very pleased with the quality of this product the only spice which i found can be used for all the recipies i tried it for simple vegetables to nice complex meat dishes and even sweets like ice cream and it worked great it a nice and balanced blend and saves u the time for blending different spices so just use this into any of the indian recipies and enjoy	2
1	this spice is impossible to find at a local market i was so happy to find it on line it arrived quickly and was fresh and authentic i will certainly order again !	2
1	i could not remember the name source of our previous petit fours so i ordered them from wisconsin cheeseman because i had never had a problem with previous orders from this company the order was delivered on time these petit fours were more moist and flavorful than those from our previous source everyone who received them as gifts commented on them	2
1	i took a gamble and bought food over the internet and it tastes great	2
1	my boyfriend just found out the hard way that he has a wheat gluten allergy i 've tried experimenting with different non wheat fours but they 're expensive and do n't turn out very well \( and i'm a good cook ! \) he especially misses shortbread and butter cookies so we were thrilled to see these in a local market ! they 're a little different but they 're good ! this is coming from someone who hates store bought cookies i 'd pick these over most wheat flour cookies any day	2
1	i love earthbound mini carrots they taste sweet and you do n't find dried out pieces in bag like in some other companies i eat them out of the bag as a snack i boil these and mash them with potatoes and use the water in soups and various dishes on the downside mini carrots which are young carrots are abruptly pulled out of the ground by their hair the carrots' skin is then peeled off and stuffed in a plastic bag while still living then they are eaten alive or boiled alive and the're babies ! ! ! yes little carrots are babies and we eat them it 's cruel world if your a carrot	2
1	these taste like real carrots and not the things that have been sprayed with who knows what and grown wherever i buy these all the time since they never seem to last long in our house they are particularly nice dipped in ranch dressing with bacon bits and just have a sweeter flavor when kids are grabbing them all the time instead of cookies well then i guess that 's all you can say ! highly recommend	2
1	why are these carrots earthbound \? can they not transcend this world \? if we all join together we can liberate these carrots	2
1	tired of dulling your carrot peeler \? these carrots are already peeled for you ! are normal carrots too big for you \? well these are mini carrots perfect for that mini person that ca n't handle an entire carrot sick of pesticide tainted carrots \? these are organic what more could you want	2
1	my children really love these little carrots and they eat them all the time in fact true story we were at the park one day and i was handing out cookies and my daughter \( then 4 \) turned to me and said ahh mom do n't you have any carrots i thought the other moms would burst \) four stars somewhat pricey but since my children eat them i do n't complain the ones we get here are sweet i love that they are organic since carrots like celery can absorb alot of chemicals	2
1	i have been purchasing these mushrooms for years by driving to specialty stores in either nyc or philadelphia even including shipping this is the best price i have ever seen on these mushrooms ! i even received an e mail telling me shipping may be delayed due to hurricane wilma but still got the product in less than a week ! i paid more than double this in a famous philadelphia cheese shop and the quality was n't as good as this ! i will definitely be doing more business with this company !	2
1	absolutely excellent ! i use procini 's all the time the quality of these are first rate in addition the quantity of these are such that the value is high no more will i buy little bags in the grocery store	2
1	i'm so glad i can now get this at amazon living in idaho this is not something readily available to me	2
1	this product is great its much easier to get in canada that 's why i ordered it online since i am now living in the us however after the fact i did find it available at cost plus world market next time i will pay attention to the volume of the product the picture is not the right one this double size is really waay to much for my use i think i now have a lifetime supply using custard powder is way better in homemade nanaimo bars than using vanilla pudding mixes	2
1	this is haribo gummi candy the original i love all of their products but this one is especially good i have ordered it twice and will again if you a gummi bear fan you will really love this	2
1	these cherries are awesome my whole family loves them we lived in germany for 3 years and to find a place state side to order these from is great we order alot of them beucase they sure go fast	2
1	i use marketspice loose tea to put inside sachet 's which are then stashed and hung around the house from november through febuary the tea gives off a fabulous aroma all fall and winter long	2
1	as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree or the rieme french vanilla syrup when i'm writing reviews and i get sleepy this teawakes me up the rebecca review	2
1	it started 31 years ago when my in laws from washington came for a visit \( to california \) bearing gifts a wonderful treat called market spice tea we added a tablespoon of it to our pot of brewing coffee and have n't stopped yet 31 years later i'm just thrilled we can do it online now yeah market spice ! and yeah amazon for bringing it to us ! \( we 're in missouri now and are spreading it across the nation as we go \) your 1 fan ! melody arnoldwentworth m	2
1	great unique flavor ! ! not hot at all i add my own peppers for the heat but if you want great tasting chili use gebhardts i usually use an entire 3 oz bottle of powder with every pot of chili i make my neighbors love when i give them my extras when i make my big pot of chili	2
1	i think this is the best chocolate i have ever tasted every time i go to a grocery store i see to that i get it it tastes heavenly and makes you go for it again and again i would even give it more than 5 stars	2
1	these are the greatest things in the world at the prices on amazon you ca n't loose definatly a good buy	2
1	it tastes like cornbread but it is still good however the shipper took 1 month to deliver the product ! okay if you do n't mind waiting for a ridiculous amount of time	2
1	never had biscotti before what a treat since then i 've tried other biscotti and this was the best	2
1	i bought this for my mother and when she opened it she absolutely loved the mug but she really loved it when she made her first cup of hot chocolate she called me raving about how good godiva hot chocolate was and how she 's been spoiled and wo n't want to drink any other brand it is delicious and the mug was large and well made and beautiful	2
1	this tea tastes great and it gives a nicely conceived fresh looking feel i purchase 2 small packages but i sure will get more	2
1	these cookes are so good i have tried many that look similar but none are as good as these too bad most stores have stopped carrying them	2
1	we are always thrilled with the quality of stella d'oro cookies they do indeed deserve the gold star these are shortcake cookies very rich with a fudge center they are quite sweet and great for a tea table or served with a cup of strong espresso this is the kind of cookie to pull out for top notch guests and for dainty occasions like neighbors over for coffee tea parties and after dinner sweets	2
1	these have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now both in new york california i just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares recently i moved to the southeast tho and panicked when i could n't find any stella d'oro cookies anywhere ! i'm so happy to find them here at amazon where i'm a regular shopper anyway now i can add them to my order everytime i buy something !	2
1	these cookies are so addictive and there is no lack of fudge on them which that is a plus other brand of their swiss fudge cookies is not as perfect as they believe it is the outside of the cookie does not blend well with the little bit of fudge they put on it keep making this wonderful cookie and i hope the stores will stock them again	2
1	these cookies are amazing i challenge anyone to find a finer packaged cookie than stella d'oro 's swiss fudge cookies they are n't overly sweet but they are incredibly flavorful i do n't think these are distributed in the midwest south \( i 've never seen them \) so it 's really great that amazon has them for me to order ! thanks !	2
1	tasty bite punjab eggplant is delicious and spicy try adding a bit of plain yogurt serve with rice or bread \( nan or pita work well \) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars this is true of all of the tasty bite indian entrees i wish the tasty bite thai meals came as entrees \( i e without the rice or noodles \) so i could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles tasty bite entrees are really easy to keep on hand since they do n't have to be refrigerated buying in bulk works well for these	2
1	this has good flavor but be warned it is quite hot as well enjoy	2
1	i 've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best ! ! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter the cinnamon crumb cake is delicious	2
1	a friend shared her marketspice tea with me years ago and i was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me i ordered some and that wonderful taste was still the same the teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in it 's a flavor you wo n't find anywhere else you can taste the orange and the cinnamon and they 're just a little sweet you may not need to even sweeten yours !	2
1	for those of you who love the cinnamon taste this tea is by far the best i have ever had the stronger the better !	2
1	awesome tea i highly recommend it has a kick to it spice and orange flavor great customer service	2
1	my boyfriend is a huge fan of duck he loves it roast duck duck a l'orange chicken fried duck duck varsovia braised duck duck chow mein duck n dumplins duck in claret etc you get the idea anyway we were cuddling in bed one night and he said i picked up a tub of rendered duck fat from amazon com and it is really tasty stuff i said oh yeah \? and he said yeah let me get it and let you try it so one thing led to another and we ended up using it you know intimately woooo ! we 'll never use k y again	2
1	i bought mine at walmart a few years ago and have n't seen them since these are so fun even to sit on the coffee table during the holidays when guests come over you push down on the back of the reindeer and the tails lifts to let a bean drop out it 's a riot they are small but hilarious and lots of fun ! i recommend this for anyone who has a sense of humor	2
1	my kids got a kick out of finding these in their stockings on christmas morning	2
1	this was hilarious all the teen boys enjoyed this as a gag gift order was processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner	2
1	i have given this gift three times all three times to lonely old guys on the internet with no love life and bady body odor \( i assume \) each time they ate the jellybeans and enjoyed the way the beans fell from the reindeer 's butt i think it pleases bachelors and therefor pleases me	2
1	this is a great gift for that person in your family who still thinks fart jokes are funny or for ten year olds only one problem due to inconsistant sizes of jelly beans the poor raindeer had a dispensing problem on occaission which requires one to rip off the reindeer 's head \( thank goodness it 's on a hinge \) to alleviate the problem this could be traumatic to the more sensitive merry christmas ! !	2
1	this is very hot at first but then it calms down dave's insanity stays hot longer but my husband is happy with the both of them	2
1	johnny 's is great for steaks burgers chicken just about anything much better than lowrey 's seasoned salt	2
1	ume en is one of the best brands of green tea powder i have ever tasted this tea has a light delicate flavor with just a touch of sweetness which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful relaxing and rejuvenating experience with this drink tea time is going to take on a whole new meaning i would definitely recommend this product	2
0	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart it 's extremely heavy on advertisements \( 45 at my rough count \) and really cluttered and just not good the recipes are interesting if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin hydration ads	3
0	even if you 're a conservative you gotta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around if you like good writing do n't even try this one a one star is still too generous in my opinion	3
0	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world read this magazine national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists would n't want to be in that camp if i were you read time mother jones the nation or the american prospect instead	3
0	i got this magazine as a gift starting a few months back i really ca n't say i'm impressed admittedly i'm much more left leaning than this conservative \( sometimes very very conservative \) magazine dispite my bias i can still recognize good writing and well made points this magazine generally lacks both this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything they 're just fairly rare if you want to read a well written well argued conservative mag this is n't it	3
0	i received this subscription as a trial and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read by the last few issues that i got i was n't even looking at the pictures anymore there are drawn out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life which were very materialistic at the end of every issue there were pictures of quot real life quot wedding announcements perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper but it struck me as out of place in a magazine	3
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection if it 's free but not worth your money to own i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here oh once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine but not consistently the home section is n't that inspirational either go for it if it 's free but if it 's not do n't buy it	3
0	this is a yuppie magazine for people with endless bank accounts and nothing to do with their money what 's more is i did n't see a thing that had anything to do with actual gardens !	3
0	i made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen i received a very good offer to subscribe that i did n't want to turn down i thought this was going to be like a better homes and gardens or country living but it was n't this appears to be a good choice for design professionals i was just not very impressed	3
0	it seemed like there were 2 articles amp 80 pages of advertisements	3
0	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion \( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford \) the whole magazine is one big ad if i wanted that i could just turn on the tv	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
0	the articles are good but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point too many annoying ads if u want something to read this isnt the magazine for yo	3
0	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of \( at least \) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers while the elle magazines in bookstores supermarket etc have thick glossy high quality paper for their covers the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover i guess the company wanted to cut cost because to remain competitve they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount still it 's cheating	3
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit it 's filled with many success stories but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success it 's also extremely geared towards franchising every other article and every other ad is about franchising i have a one year subscription and at this point i'm bored i 'll keep the subscription but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur com you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine and will prove to be a great wealth of information	3
0	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group we were sorely disappointed most of the articles are not new information but quot rehashed quot info widely available we read it cover to cover for about 4 months then cancelled the subscription there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !	3
0	when i first heard there was an american version of l'uomo vouge i was really excited i thought finally an american men 's fashion magazine that 'll be edgy risky creative original ! i could n't have been more wrong this magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster men 's magazines gq esquire details european men 's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography bold reporting beautiful advertising you wo n't find any of this in men 's vouge the editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of american readers if i could i 'd give this magazine a negative 5	3
0	all this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes i ca n't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number anywhere to contact customer service do n't waste your money unless you love paris hilton	3
0	this is a tabloid so most likely the stories you 're reading are not true why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that a rumor	3
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords she stopped receiving it in june well before her 12 month subscription expired	3
0	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription true each issue would be more expensive but1 \) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying as some are thin and empty2 \) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue i have only gotten one issue on time to be honest	3
0	if you are looking for actual good workouts look to oxygen or womens m f	3
0	i have n't received this item it has been almost two months	3
0	self what \? the entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page their product placements went from convenient and subtle to obviously pandering to their revenue sources plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain could n't relate i once enjoyed self and their monthly self help plans their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing	3
0	i 've subscribed to self on and off for about 15 years but have recently been feeling like i 've outgrown the magazine the articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers fine but not for me anymore ! also their subscription department is terrible ! my most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues double issues and late issues and a customer service department that ca n't quite pull themselves together	3
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships i found that customer service was very dissapointing i missed an issue back in october and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed it is now march and i still have n't received my replacement just a heads up !	3
0	i received my first issue of modern bride in the mail yesterday it was just the cover of the magazine nothing else ! now i 'll have to go through the trouble of ordering a replacement do yourself a favor and just go to a news stand and buy one	3
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great but i wonder what the problem is i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore	3
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription i only received about 3 issues total months went by without anything being delivered while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful nothing happens immediately when planning a wedding each and every month is precious especially during the initial stages of wedding planning to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting plus by this time most of the wedding details were finalized the magazines i received became useless if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride	3
0	i love the mag but sister never recieved the order i gave her as a gift ! ! !	3
0	i used to really like us magazine i have been collecting every issue each week for several years now but wait ! has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year \? where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities movies and music \? there 's no more than a thumbnail 's sketch of info on anything now it 's all photos and quickie hype it has no more substance what happened to this good magazine	3
0	why is it that us weekly ca n't get a copy to me weekly \? sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue then i 'll receive three in one week us weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses i'm not buying their story or the magazine again	3
0	i have been subscribing to us weekly for about a year and a half in that time i have never seen an issue without several pages of jessica simpson i have to wonder does jessica donate money to this magazine \? she seems to dominate the whole magazine each and every week i wo n't be renewing my subscription i'm tired of jessica and the untruths that us weekly supplies	3
0	i worked there briefly and they're rude and obnoxious and have no class i wouldn't be surprised if some of the stories they're accusing of making up are true they deserve to be sued and stopped all of them are repulsive i'm glad i got out when i did !	3
0	okay so in touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is a glossy tabloid but just when you did n't think it was possible for the american tabloid press to dumb down any further along came in touch weekly and us weekly all in touch really is is a bunch of photographs their writing is slop fit for second graders and it does n't go into much detail \( and we all know how amazingly accurate these tabloids are anyway \) want a quality tabloid \? read hello ! magazine \( from england \) donna di giacom	3
0	i have yet to receive even one issue i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3
0	where are all of my magazine subscription first issues \? \? \? \? \? \? \? mar	3
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies filled with poorly written articles i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine this magazine promotes commercial products and no i'm not talking about the advertisements but the actual articles themselves the magazine is not a news magazine it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in if you like paying for ads go for it	3
0	i ordered this as a gift subscription on may 10 by july 20 it still had not arrived i contacted customer service and was told itwould n't arrive until september ! the description says it will take 6 10 weeks it has now been 10 weeks and i 've been informed it will be another 6 weeks	3
0	2 months after ordering i have year to get my first issue i'm sure i 'll like it if i ever get it	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	they may have some good info but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads and within the ads a lot of scams and mlm schemes buyer beware	3
0	i purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level in fact it is not really either	3
0	i got charged for this and havent gotten it what bulls	3
0	i still have not received this magazine what is taking so long ! !	3
0	i wish i had something good to say but i ordered this barron 's subscription back in august 06 i 've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it it is now november and i'm still waiting i called customer service and amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago my next call will be to ask for my money back hopefully this is n't happening to other subscribers i 've ordered several other magazines from amazon and always received them on a timely basis	3
0	when you watch commercial children 's television you have to accept the commercials because after all the programs are free but when you pay to subscribe to nickelodeon magazine i do n't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children these ads appear similar to the editorial content it seems like 50 of the pages are advertisements ! i was disappointed and wo n't be renewing our subscription better to look at something from the highlights magazine series	3
0	this magazine should be free since there are so many advertisements also it is strictly modern decorating unlike the editor 's claims if you like extreme modern style try it out otherwise invest in something else	3
0	i have n't received this product yet and i'm pretty upset about it i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer i think i'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer where is the product i bought \? \? \?	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
0	laptop magazine focuses on laptops pdas and wireless computing laptop magazine seems like it 's trying to be both technical and exciting however it lacks the objectivity of pc magazine and the deep enthusiasm of wired thus it reads like a series of infomercials where each quot article quot paints a rose colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text their conclusions all seem predetermined new technology is better	3
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively it 's not a really serious computer magazine it 's more or less like consumer guide which is basically paid advertising this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers in the end i feel this is a waste of money besides you can get all the info for free on the web from cnet or zdnet anyway	3
0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	3
0	i got my first month \( a horrible green day issue \) and then nothing ! uh what up \? its not that good of a magazine i just want what i paid for	3
0	spin will do anything to try and stay hip i wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their quot tribute quot to kurt cobain mag im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures they were poorly written and dull they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt 's music and his impact on an entire generation i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin	3
0	ca n't give a review on maximum pc never received the magazine instead i was sent the men 's magazine fhm please send my maximum pc	3
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	i do n't know what the heck is going on with your subscription service i bought this magazine for my nephew back on july 9th and he still hasn't recieved an issue ! ! ! ! i am extremely disappointed with your service it should not take this long to get a magazine	3
0	this magazine is all puff if you 're looking for honest and insightful reviews this is not your read however if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue	3
0	lots of lovely photos great ideas deco tips and food	3
0	i flip through time every now and again at the barber shop sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists for the most part since time receives most of its revenues from big business advertisements it ca n't challenge the establishment as it needs to so instead i read magazines like z utne mother jones the progressive the sun earth island and the new internationalist	3
0	my sixth grader likes it it is extremely ordinary and easy to outgrow	3
0	this was a gift for my daughter instead of receiving the new yorker she is receiving people you need to fix this	3
0	new york magazine 's articles and advertisements are too risque always pushing the envelope thanks but no thanks	3
0	it would be nice if i were writing about the magazine content here but since i never received a single copy of my subscription all i can say is their customer service sucks ! ! ! ! after repeated attempts to correct the delivery address or find out what happened the issue still has n't been resolved note i 've had a number of delivery problems when ordering magazines on amazon \( there might be some glitch \) however the other magazines have quickly corrected the problem soon after contact	3
0	amazon must think we are fools it 's 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website on the other hand there appear to be a lot of fools here	3
0	i was ecstatic when i received this magazine subscription as as gift two issues into my subscription it stopped i was really anticipating the december issue because i had many guests coming and could use some of martha 's helpful advice however it never came and neither did january or february i have called martha stewart living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic i still have not received another issue when i asked to cancel for a refund i was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up being that it was a gift this is useless very clever for martha and very frustrating for the giftee consumer	3
0	the amazon ad said next day shipping took over a month for the first magazine to arrive do not buy this from amazo	3
0	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it not for some guilt ridden agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics \( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate \) is something we should all read about at nauseum when they stick to music it 's good when they parade their shreiking political views it 's boring	3
0	more and more all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure and if you indulge in such a thing you are 'shallow' music has evolved past this attitude and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore and oh yeah their politics is so mixed up they do n't even know what they believe anymore i was a subscriber for eleven years my renewal notice came and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in	3
0	oh lord ! ! does anyone still read this \? \? i was a subscriber back in the early 70 's when it was a folded up newspaper by and large jann wenner let people run it that knew how to it is now and has been nothing more than an ad choked gossiping teen slick right like they are the ones with the money ! ! i wonder what they still pay raoul duke to do \? \? ! ! ralph gleason has to be turning over in the grave	3
0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	i bought this magazine as reading material for my flight home from ruzyne airport in prague to nyc this was the first time i ever purchased this magazine terrible choice first of all this magazine was not worth the 10 usd i paid for it it was way too large to do anything with on the airplane and the content was for the lack of a better word boring ! every other page was some chic ad who buys this magazine \? well i will not be buying it again	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3
0	i 've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine something happened to them in early 2006 they 've either been bought or have hired a new editor staff or something this magazine is absolutely terrible now all ads fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue and the hilarious articles are now long gone my last two issues \( sept and oct \) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox i'm canceling my subscription	3
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual content in about an hour the rest is advertising and bs this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago just let it die already like it 's supposed to	3
0	i certainly do hope one of these days that maxim magazing will get women who are small breasted equal time that 's all i have to say	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
0	i wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it will not renew not what i wanted	3
0	i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything about it i was very disappointed not enough recipes the recipes that are included are not really ones that i would use	3
0	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to take a ride on the creativity of others my advice do not purchase read or advertise in this third rate publication there is little more credibility or validity than watching jerry springer please do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only	3
0	amazon sells a one year subscription for 14 which includes a 5 amazon certificate that you get later in the actual magazine the subscription card is 6 99 for one year or 2 years for 10 00so use the card save some money and also dont have to wait for your 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the 5 certificate on	3
0	for some strange reason i began receiving this magazine in the mail never ordered never paid for my conclusion based on reading the last three issues you 're kidding me how can time inc still publish this rag \? what 's the point	3
0	the problem with computer shopper is it 's neither a serious trade magazine like pc mag or a shopper 's paradise like its former self was if you want hardware tips maximum pc is way better you can find pretty much everything in computer shopper for free on the web	3
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription after i read the first issue i decided to cancel there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written for example you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are the rest of the magazines are all advertisements which you can get for free from the internet \( or just anywhere \)	3
0	why \? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it has nothing to do with natural health it has to do with advertisements it is empty completelly more it looks like a woman magazine but i believe that a clever woman would feel like i feel now angry ! i paid for something that i believed but it is not ok we make mistakes	3
0	was n't worth the subscription i found the magazine to be bland full of ads and basically boring all the information can be found doing a quick web search highly disappointed	3
0	i loved this magazine in 1995 until a few years ago they have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads no new information glossy pics of models with bright red lips what is about health here \? get life extension magazine and alternative medicine magazine they 've changed too over the last few years but still a far sight better than this one	3
0	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3
0	nice cover pictures and headlines but way too many ads there 's a reason its only twelve bucks this is an ad sponsored mag	3
0	i send away for a 2 year subscription they sent me a 1 year sub i wrote 5 letters sent copies of bank cheque and order form emailed them no response they could care less what more can i do \?	3
0	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !	3
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3
0	i cannot review this item because a month later i still have not received the first issue of my subscription sorryfrank caldero	3
0	ordered 11 27 never received a single copy not very fast is it \? slow company may be a better description can i have my money back	3
0	all you manager types you know who you areyou read 'who moved the cheese' and jesus ceo this is the mag for youlame triteand oh so self importen	3
0	do n't pay amazon 34 for this subscription when you can get it directly from national geographic for 15	3
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine in my opinon more than half of the magazine is advertisements and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and or thought provoking if you like ads and cologne samples pick it up after all it is pretty decently priced	3
0	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	3
0	i hate this magazine i subscribed sight unseen based on the good reviews and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat way too exotic if you like good ol' american fare do n't buy this one	3
0	if i see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek i am going to puke i have not seen one truly imaginative artistic image in this magazine everything is run of the mill boring standard outdoor photography lots of sunsets flower fields no different angles or perspectives colors nothing new the articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive i think i clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines	3
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature stupid and boring the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste do n't bother	3
0	the writing seems to have come from under educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool i was n't sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles this magazine is n't for men it 's for boys however the one star is for the photos of the women which we ca n't deny both men and boys can appreciate	3
0	i 've at various times subscribed to stuff maxim and fhm magazines stuff was the only one i ended up not resubscribing to it has its moments and the photography is fine i would describe it as maxim 's younger brother it 's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny etc but it is forced and very juvenile it just is snarky and predictable after awhile on the other hand i'm not 21 anymore either and maybe if i was in my 20 's i would find this the height of humor	3
0	have n't received this item it has been almost 2 months	3
0	i have only received the paper for 2 weeks where is it \? why did it stop comin	3
0	do not order mentle floss magazin it preetends to be smart but it 's just a teaz covers intersting toppics aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself \? like ths revue it dos n't live upto it 's claims	3
0	where macworld is bad addict is dreadful it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat and the reviews do n't deserve the name the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing leaving no pretence of independence like its competitor it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry so we get articles about the secrets of such and such product a secret in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer this should be blasted not applauded but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product	3
0	this mag needs a new editor i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests	3
0	this magazine is a waste of money and bores me nothing here to see but ads	3
0	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine with its overwhelming amount of advertising takes away from any good points i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts i rarely find anything i 'd want to save overall a disappointment	3
0	for ads only pretty much there is not much to read or learn for the common reader it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone	3
0	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3
0	first off i'm a huge geek i love programming and computers and the internet you 'd think wired would be like some great magazine for me but the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this bad stuff in the world it makes you sick for every cool article about japanese robots you have to wade through like 10 articles about how america is doomed whatever they need to man up	3
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them most articles are rather pretentious and boring in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting and it only had two articles which were worth it the first was robbed blind which was about rfid chips and the second article was diy ways to go green	3
0	i am still not receiving this magazine and i had a gift subscription on that order too i've been meaning to get in touch thought it had been more than long enough for subscription to start	3
0	i am sure this will be a great magazine but i have not received my first issue yet	3
0	i can not review something that i have not received i thought i would have received my first issue by now but have not if and when i receive the magazien i order i will be happy to review	3
0	if you want to do the same exercise over and over but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead if you want better exercises and articles look to oxygen or women 's m	3
0	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction non fiction books what it turns out to be is a series of editorials premised around virtually all non fiction all very high brow and frankly quite boring the one item worthwhile is the classifieds i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues i have n't seen anything of interest	3
0	this magazine recently \( april 05 \) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time number 1 was the sing along scene from magnolia other moments in the top 10 included the credits from austin powers 3 and one of eugene levy 's quotes from american pie keep in mind these are the 100 greatest movie moments of all time this mag rag is nothing more than the film section of fhm stretched out to full issue length utter trash	3
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking' magazine what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all if you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine then this magazine might be for you if however you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it try cooks illustrated instead	3
0	order placed early june first issue of subscription not yet received this is service	3
0	lucky is one of my frequent checkout pickups bright fun and not requiring any frontal lobe interference it 's the perfect pick me up for the early morning commuter train i give it five fabulous stars ! however the actual subscription was very underhanded ! within the space of a week i was sent last month 's issue \( long gone from the stands \) the issue just about to decirculate and finally the actual current issue so two weeks after my order i am already 3 issues in to a 12 issue subscription and none too happy about it cond nast needs to be told that subscribers do not exist to let them clear out their unsold backlog	3
0	american photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like pop photo and photographic it has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy quot glamour quot photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn no stars	3
0	bad journalism and plenty of adds if you like to exoticize black people then this is your mag nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost	3
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue i cannot get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and i have not even been able to get my money back i would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from kerr	3
0	ct is quick to call the collection agency they require written quot opt out quot notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated beware these guys are a credit risk too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine	3
0	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read they are by far the worst	3
0	2 months after ordering i have year to get my first issue i'm sure i 'll like it if i ever get it	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	ordered my wife a subscription last christmas recieved 2 issues never got the rest of them i 'll never order magazines through amazon again	3
0	about two years ago vanity fair was not only the best magazine of the year but maybe all time i would read it from cover to cover now sadly it is a bunch of fluff the quality has really gone downhill i am going to let my subscription run out i really miss the old days	3
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands \( with a big heavy thud \) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders self regarding movie celebs and those people who 'd like to be part of that world even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent it 'd be more accurate simply to cut fair out of the title	3
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work \( her \) on the cover just turned me off completely sorry you thought her 'cover worthy' probably missed some fine articles sincerely deane everett	3
0	i 've subscripted to gourmet for years but i let my subscription run out the lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies as i read through food magazines i dog ear the page with a recipe i want to try in the last year there were very few dog eared pages and it was n't worth continuing the subscription	3
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing that 's about it this mag seems to be biased towards certain products amp manufacturers they neglected to open my eyes wider the reviews articles that are published seem to favor big money companies \( microsoft dell etc \) they do n't give credit to smaller better less well known companies and technologies all the info is pretty basic for intro users but if that 's what you are interested in then this is a great non comlicated publication	3
0	i paid i never received magazine at all even though i received all four of the other magazines that were ordered at the same time	3
0	i would n't know if this was a good magazine i have yet to receive it after waiting three months it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway	3
0	the editor 's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine which you 'll enjoy only if you 're like her rich creepily entitled self absorbed and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining but not really food or actual cooking itself	3
0	i subscribed to food amp wine for a while and was continuously disappointed the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad this magazine ca n't hold a candle to quot bon appetit quot or quot gourmet quot	3
0	this is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch out from the standard family circle or good housekeeping no risk recipes my big problem with this company is once they 've got your contact information you will receive more junk mail than you thought one company could generate hawking every single publication they produce relentlessly i stopped subscribing and it took a year to stop receiving their snail spam and there 's no way to 'opt out' onlin	3
0	as a professional photographer i think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way the images are predictable and unimaginative and have n't changed in the past 25 years there are much better magazines to read	3
0	there are very few serious articles in this magazine just tons of tidbits \( stats facts tips \) by the time you get to the end it 's difficult to recall anything from the magazine it 's that shallow occasionally there 's a good recipe but that 's about it	3
0	i started my first subscription to this one in 1980 81 it was excellent ! ! it had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to preventing ailments conditions now it 's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters ! wow what a change now i'm not interested in paying to read ads i 'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources besides i got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while i rode the stationery bike ! what a waste of trees	3
0	this magazine seems most interested in promoting books etc that it has a financial interest in most notably lately the south beach diet prevention and it 's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads too bad because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition weight loss exercise and natural remedies that is n't influenced by it 's publishing partners and advertisers skip this one and try self or health for a more well rounded look at women 's heath needs	3
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements 70 or more plus articles \( less than 15 articles in every issue \) in the magazines are not very useful i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers now i realize i made a mistake	3
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
0	how people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me all the usual suspects are found through out it 's pages this rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for polictal correctness anti capitalists anti gobalisers etc with all these isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head what 's more the 'ideas' you 'll find here have been tried tested and more importantly failed ah well some people are just too easy to fool	3
0	i ordered this mag back in june now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it this equals a big fat zero in my book	3
0	i 've read many positive reviews of this magazine and i did receive several months ago a trial issue after sending in the subscription fee i was billed again i wrote a note letting them know that the check had been endorsed and deposited yesterday i got a notice telling me my subscription had expired after one issue i give up it might be good but customer service is really lousy what a disappointment	3
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov 6 2005 its now feb 22nd 2006 and the magazines \( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american \) are nowhere to be seen of course my account was quickly charged and at this pace i'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine it might be a better idea to get somewhere else	3
0	i dont enjoy this publication at all anymore dont know if editorial leadership has change	3
0	gee i guess i really ca n't rate it i ordered it on august 9th and still have not recieved it as of november 3rd guess i 'll know better then to order through amazon again	3
0	as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor 's office and reading it because it was the only thing available it has not changed much there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content this magazine will neither stretch your child 's mind nor keep him entertained it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen in the coming era of global connection children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia	3
0	i ordered this magazine a year ago and my nephew still have n't receive a single magazine ! every time i email customer service they would tell me that it 's coming next month i will let you how the magazine is when i get it but do n't hold your breath	3

0	this magazine used to be thick fun to read full of information but that was about 5 years ago now it 's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non sense the editorial is almost always filled with political opinions i wo n't renew my subscription	3
0	this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo do n't waste your money	3

0	i was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor 's office i love instyle lucky and other shopping mags but the tone of this is mean and snooty there are too many ads and very little content there 's a q a section about sex after baby that 's just mean threatening that if you do n't jump back in one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing way to put an anti feminist tone on sex after baby yuck	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided why not \? \? its been a year and although the previews of each week 's prime time programs are fun \( 2 pages worth \) i was very dissapointed the articles are empty boring and some downright retarded rehashing show 's dialogues requoteing newscomments its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around i realize this is an entertainment magazine but still the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide much more interestin	3
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing boy am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health	3
0	i ordered on 10 4 2005 as of march 27th i still have n't received the first issue i do n't even want it now ! how do i get credit for the payment made back in october	3
0	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it \? \? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it	3
0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag and save your money to buy books that nourish you	3
0	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
0	please see tj mccarthy 's review elsewhere here he is to borrow a phrase from across the pond spot on in his comments just this week i cancelled my 10 year subscription to pc magazine one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor jim louderback has dropped the old tagline on the front cover an independent guide to technology i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is in fact just a marketing vehicle for various products if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing stay away from this publication	3

0	i have received this magazine from it 's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies however the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service i have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right i have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer if you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them	3

0	why pay 34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for 19 9	3
0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3

0	recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and i could n't believe my eyes the magazine is a skeleton of its former self with slim stories and little science bob guccione jr 's mag is not even that fun to read on the happier side the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations	3
0	i thought i detected some deterioration in the quality of discover magazine in recent months so i went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion indeed they have sad	3
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3
0	i have subscribed to discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription the magazine which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag from juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers op ed page the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash	3
0	i know apr is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there and i think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine but it 's more of the national enquirer of poetry magazines it 's a large newspaper style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles you 'd be better off subscribing to poetry the hudson review the texas review tar river poetry or any number of other journals	3
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full page ads for galleries in europe there are very few articles or artist bios the photos are beautiful but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries	3
0	have n't received this item it has been almost 2 months	3
0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago today it is a totally unneeded magazine its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article is actually quite goofy the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm	3
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen that was a bad decision after having received two issues i continue to be disappointed the quality of the art design and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
0	i have n't received this product yet and i'm pretty upset about it i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer i think i'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer where is the product i bought \? \? \?	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided why not \? \? its been a year and although the previews of each week 's prime time programs are fun \( 2 pages worth \) i was very dissapointed the articles are empty boring and some downright retarded rehashing show 's dialogues requoteing newscomments its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around i realize this is an entertainment magazine but still the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide much more interestin	3
0	simply stated if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority buy the mag i 'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons	3
0	this magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work had time to work out four hours a day had your own chef could go on vacation six months out of the year or could afford \( or cared \) about fashion otherwise do n't bother they sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it	3
0	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9 11 since that time mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be which might have been fine for one issue this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas	3
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband it took 5 months to get the first magazine then i never recieved another one	3
0	do n't get me wrong occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing now the focus seems to be health fitness and diet i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore man i miss the old mj	3

0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews unlike the description included on the amazon website the subsription does not include the cd rom which costs an additional 1 issue and if you want to purchase the cd roms for past issues they cost 4 disk sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain buyer beware	3
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd rom called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at 19 95 that there would be no monthly cd rom they charged us another 10 to have the monthly cd rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues but that cd rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd rom it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine	3
0	i ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it	3
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue	3
0	i subscribed to forbes magazine for a year or two and in general the content is good but i cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons \( a \) 33 of the pages are all advertisements what a waste of space \( b \) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as i read the magazine and \( b \) the classifieds in the back are not of interest to any real business person if you do n't mind the ads and the fluff then this magazine might be right for you ! it 's not for me i give it 2 stars	3
0	forbes is a great magazine amazon on the other hand well they ought to get out of the magazine business order said first issue would be in february amazon forgot to place the order until i called in april to find out what happened now they claim the first issue will be june 19 yeah right funny how they do n't forget to charge the credit card you place the order do n't order magazines from amazon	3

0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else \? i will never order a magazine from amazon again i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead	3
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3
0	the magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up it is not an 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes being sexually active and kissing i am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate	3
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read motortrend car and driver automobile mag sport compact i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny	3
0	the national enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency to now attack a sweet wonderful charitable guy like clay aiken is very very sad to go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing but to go after a quiet humble guy like clay is another and now what \? is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage their story is ludicrous and they owe clay his family and all of his fans a big apology i will not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	full of ads hardly any content at all not worth paying for it	3
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product it 's to give a good review until it arrives	3

0	the weekly standard is just more of the same it 's not strictly speaking journalism but i imagine you 'd like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view if you like rush or fox news you 'd probably like it if you are looking for a serious media outlet this is not it	3
0	this is one of the worse magazines i have picked up in years if you have money to burn traveling then it might be for you loaded with advertising and little 'true' content	3
0	just from picking up this mag in the store and reading their spin off pocket gaming i have concluded that this magazine is pure rubbish i would n't waste my money subscribing	3
0	i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine is n't worthy of its title i subscribed before reading review i was hoping to find an affordable psychology based read though some stories are interesting i'm sure i 'd be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo and there is plenty of ads probably more than stories and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it it took forever for the first issue to arrive now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	3
0	the latest pshycology today had to be trashed the clinic treats abused women and incest and rape victims lust did n't go over well	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
0	this is probably the best music movie magazine out today however you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for 8 95 or something this deal is bs	3
0	love to review history today but have n't seen a copy yet any ideas	3
0	where are the critiques \? the articles lack any critical substance whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype vibe will go along with the flow on top of that there are more ads now than ever before even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space	3
0	i ordered a subscription for my step son and a gift for a niece at the same time they took my money and both of the one year subscriptions i paid for only resulted in one issue to each child i could n't get any more information on the magazine as we never received any more informaiton until i got an e mail from amazon asking me to renew i noticed another recent post with the same problem the magazine was really great and my step son and niece both waited and waited for their next issue which never showed how disappointing i would n't take the chance if i were you ld	3
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
0	i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine since i already got parents i chose child i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up the magazine is boring the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages if you want a magazine about parenting kids go with parents	3
0	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
0	sure i like a mystery who does n't \? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story the tales are hard edged and lacking in style and substance we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment the value for money is horrible the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge alfred hitchcock would not be proud	3
0	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart it 's extremely heavy on advertisements \( 45 at my rough count \) and really cluttered and just not good the recipes are interesting if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin hydration ads	3

0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription after i read the first issue i decided to cancel there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written for example you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are the rest of the magazines are all advertisements which you can get for free from the internet \( or just anywhere \)	3

0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3

0	i 've subscribed to self on and off for about 15 years but have recently been feeling like i 've outgrown the magazine the articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers fine but not for me anymore ! also their subscription department is terrible ! my most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues double issues and late issues and a customer service department that ca n't quite pull themselves together	3
0	recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and i could n't believe my eyes the magazine is a skeleton of its former self with slim stories and little science bob guccione jr 's mag is not even that fun to read on the happier side the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations	3

0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3
0	i have subscribed to discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription the magazine which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag from juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers op ed page the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash	3
0	i know apr is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there and i think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine but it 's more of the national enquirer of poetry magazines it 's a large newspaper style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles you 'd be better off subscribing to poetry the hudson review the texas review tar river poetry or any number of other journals	3

0	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it not for some guilt ridden agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics \( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate \) is something we should all read about at nauseum when they stick to music it 's good when they parade their shreiking political views it 's boring	3
0	more and more all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure and if you indulge in such a thing you are 'shallow' music has evolved past this attitude and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore and oh yeah their politics is so mixed up they do n't even know what they believe anymore i was a subscriber for eleven years my renewal notice came and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in	3
0	oh lord ! ! does anyone still read this \? \? i was a subscriber back in the early 70 's when it was a folded up newspaper by and large jann wenner let people run it that knew how to it is now and has been nothing more than an ad choked gossiping teen slick right like they are the ones with the money ! ! i wonder what they still pay raoul duke to do \? \? ! ! ralph gleason has to be turning over in the grave	3
0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3

0	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3
0	first off i'm a huge geek i love programming and computers and the internet you 'd think wired would be like some great magazine for me but the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this bad stuff in the world it makes you sick for every cool article about japanese robots you have to wade through like 10 articles about how america is doomed whatever they need to man up	3
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them most articles are rather pretentious and boring in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting and it only had two articles which were worth it the first was robbed blind which was about rfid chips and the second article was diy ways to go green	3

0	about two years ago vanity fair was not only the best magazine of the year but maybe all time i would read it from cover to cover now sadly it is a bunch of fluff the quality has really gone downhill i am going to let my subscription run out i really miss the old days	3
0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands \( with a big heavy thud \) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders self regarding movie celebs and those people who 'd like to be part of that world even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent it 'd be more accurate simply to cut fair out of the title	3
0	i trashed the issue when i saw the shot of trashy paris hilton there is enough nudity already in your publication and seeing that sad piece of work \( her \) on the cover just turned me off completely sorry you thought her 'cover worthy' probably missed some fine articles sincerely deane everett	3
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen that was a bad decision after having received two issues i continue to be disappointed the quality of the art design and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
0	i have n't received this product yet and i'm pretty upset about it i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer i think i'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer where is the product i bought \? \? \?	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3

0	simply stated if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority buy the mag i 'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons	3
0	this magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work had time to work out four hours a day had your own chef could go on vacation six months out of the year or could afford \( or cared \) about fashion otherwise do n't bother they sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it	3
0	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9 11 since that time mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be which might have been fine for one issue this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas	3
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband it took 5 months to get the first magazine then i never recieved another one	3
0	do n't get me wrong occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing now the focus seems to be health fitness and diet i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore man i miss the old mj	3

0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag and save your money to buy books that nourish you	3

0	awful ! ! ! this is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets and clothing there were two articles at the very end of the magazine and they were awful one on christmas in the english countryside should have been beautiful instead it contained just a few pics and very little text what a disappointment do n't waste your money first pick up a copy in the supermarket before you waste money on a subscription once you see how really ridiculous this magazine full of nothing but ads really is you wo n't waste your money on a subscription	3
0	i received this subscription as a trial and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read by the last few issues that i got i was n't even looking at the pictures anymore there are drawn out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life which were very materialistic at the end of every issue there were pictures of quot real life quot wedding announcements perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper but it struck me as out of place in a magazine	3
0	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion \( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford \) the whole magazine is one big ad if i wanted that i could just turn on the tv	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
0	the articles are good but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point too many annoying ads if u want something to read this isnt the magazine for yo	3
0	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of \( at least \) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers while the elle magazines in bookstores supermarket etc have thick glossy high quality paper for their covers the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover i guess the company wanted to cut cost because to remain competitve they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount still it 's cheating	3
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships i found that customer service was very dissapointing i missed an issue back in october and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed it is now march and i still have n't received my replacement just a heads up !	3
0	i received my first issue of modern bride in the mail yesterday it was just the cover of the magazine nothing else ! now i 'll have to go through the trouble of ordering a replacement do yourself a favor and just go to a news stand and buy one	3
0	i ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue but unfortunately over the course of the year i only received a total of three issues ! the magazine is great but i wonder what the problem is i have no received much help from amazon or modern bride guess i learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore	3
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription i only received about 3 issues total months went by without anything being delivered while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful nothing happens immediately when planning a wedding each and every month is precious especially during the initial stages of wedding planning to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting plus by this time most of the wedding details were finalized the magazines i received became useless if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride	3
0	i love the mag but sister never recieved the order i gave her as a gift ! ! !	3
0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews unlike the description included on the amazon website the subsription does not include the cd rom which costs an additional 1 issue and if you want to purchase the cd roms for past issues they cost 4 disk sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain buyer beware	3
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd rom called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at 19 95 that there would be no monthly cd rom they charged us another 10 to have the monthly cd rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues but that cd rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd rom it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine	3
0	okay so in touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is a glossy tabloid but just when you did n't think it was possible for the american tabloid press to dumb down any further along came in touch weekly and us weekly all in touch really is is a bunch of photographs their writing is slop fit for second graders and it does n't go into much detail \( and we all know how amazingly accurate these tabloids are anyway \) want a quality tabloid \? read hello ! magazine \( from england \) donna di giacom	3
0	i have yet to receive even one issue i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3
0	i ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it	3
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue	3
0	i subscribed to forbes magazine for a year or two and in general the content is good but i cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons \( a \) 33 of the pages are all advertisements what a waste of space \( b \) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as i read the magazine and \( b \) the classifieds in the back are not of interest to any real business person if you do n't mind the ads and the fluff then this magazine might be right for you ! it 's not for me i give it 2 stars	3
0	forbes is a great magazine amazon on the other hand well they ought to get out of the magazine business order said first issue would be in february amazon forgot to place the order until i called in april to find out what happened now they claim the first issue will be june 19 yeah right funny how they do n't forget to charge the credit card you place the order do n't order magazines from amazon	3
0	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	3
0	2 months after ordering i have year to get my first issue i'm sure i 'll like it if i ever get it	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	i wish i had something good to say but i ordered this barron 's subscription back in august 06 i 've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it it is now november and i'm still waiting i called customer service and amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago my next call will be to ask for my money back hopefully this is n't happening to other subscribers i 've ordered several other magazines from amazon and always received them on a timely basis	3
0	when you watch commercial children 's television you have to accept the commercials because after all the programs are free but when you pay to subscribe to nickelodeon magazine i do n't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children these ads appear similar to the editorial content it seems like 50 of the pages are advertisements ! i was disappointed and wo n't be renewing our subscription better to look at something from the highlights magazine series	3
0	this magazine should be free since there are so many advertisements also it is strictly modern decorating unlike the editor 's claims if you like extreme modern style try it out otherwise invest in something else	3
0	i have n't received this product yet and i'm pretty upset about it i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer i think i'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer where is the product i bought \? \? \?	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
0	laptop magazine focuses on laptops pdas and wireless computing laptop magazine seems like it 's trying to be both technical and exciting however it lacks the objectivity of pc magazine and the deep enthusiasm of wired thus it reads like a series of infomercials where each quot article quot paints a rose colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text their conclusions all seem predetermined new technology is better	3
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively it 's not a really serious computer magazine it 's more or less like consumer guide which is basically paid advertising this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers in the end i feel this is a waste of money besides you can get all the info for free on the web from cnet or zdnet anyway	3
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	i do n't know what the heck is going on with your subscription service i bought this magazine for my nephew back on july 9th and he still hasn't recieved an issue ! ! ! ! i am extremely disappointed with your service it should not take this long to get a magazine	3
0	this magazine is all puff if you 're looking for honest and insightful reviews this is not your read however if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue	3
0	lots of lovely photos great ideas deco tips and food	3
0	i bought this magazine as reading material for my flight home from ruzyne airport in prague to nyc this was the first time i ever purchased this magazine terrible choice first of all this magazine was not worth the 10 usd i paid for it it was way too large to do anything with on the airplane and the content was for the lack of a better word boring ! every other page was some chic ad who buys this magazine \? well i will not be buying it again	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3
0	i ordered how for a graphic designer friend 's birthday in january and it is near the end of march and she still has not received anything so we have no idea how the product is we have not seen it	3
0	i cannot review this item because a month later i still have not received the first issue of my subscription sorryfrank caldero	3
0	it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands what 's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else \? i will never order a magazine from amazon again i 'll go through the actual magazine company instead	3
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3
0	the magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up it is not an 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes being sexually active and kissing i am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate	3
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read motortrend car and driver automobile mag sport compact i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny	3
0	i hate this magazine i subscribed sight unseen based on the good reviews and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat way too exotic if you like good ol' american fare do n't buy this one	3
0	if i see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek i am going to puke i have not seen one truly imaginative artistic image in this magazine everything is run of the mill boring standard outdoor photography lots of sunsets flower fields no different angles or perspectives colors nothing new the articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive i think i clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines	3
0	i have only received the paper for 2 weeks where is it \? why did it stop comin	3
0	the national enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency to now attack a sweet wonderful charitable guy like clay aiken is very very sad to go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing but to go after a quiet humble guy like clay is another and now what \? is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage their story is ludicrous and they owe clay his family and all of his fans a big apology i will not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	do not order mentle floss magazin it preetends to be smart but it 's just a teaz covers intersting toppics aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself \? like ths revue it dos n't live upto it 's claims	3
0	for ads only pretty much there is not much to read or learn for the common reader it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone	3
0	full of ads hardly any content at all not worth paying for it	3
0	i subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction non fiction books what it turns out to be is a series of editorials premised around virtually all non fiction all very high brow and frankly quite boring the one item worthwhile is the classifieds i think i 'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund i anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues i have n't seen anything of interest	3
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking' magazine what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all if you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine then this magazine might be for you if however you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it try cooks illustrated instead	3
0	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read they are by far the worst	3
0	2 months after ordering i have year to get my first issue i'm sure i 'll like it if i ever get it	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product it 's to give a good review until it arrives	3
0	unfortunately there seemed to be no recourse after i ordered this for 2 newphews as a christmas gift and it did not arrive i tried to send an email to amazon com but got bumped to someone else \( distributor \? \) who never responded so disappointing since it was a gift for someone else happened not once but twice	3
0	the weekly standard is just more of the same it 's not strictly speaking journalism but i imagine you 'd like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view if you like rush or fox news you 'd probably like it if you are looking for a serious media outlet this is not it	3
0	i found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing that 's about it this mag seems to be biased towards certain products amp manufacturers they neglected to open my eyes wider the reviews articles that are published seem to favor big money companies \( microsoft dell etc \) they do n't give credit to smaller better less well known companies and technologies all the info is pretty basic for intro users but if that 's what you are interested in then this is a great non comlicated publication	3
0	i paid i never received magazine at all even though i received all four of the other magazines that were ordered at the same time	3
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
0	i 've read many positive reviews of this magazine and i did receive several months ago a trial issue after sending in the subscription fee i was billed again i wrote a note letting them know that the check had been endorsed and deposited yesterday i got a notice telling me my subscription had expired after one issue i give up it might be good but customer service is really lousy what a disappointment	3
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov 6 2005 its now feb 22nd 2006 and the magazines \( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american \) are nowhere to be seen of course my account was quickly charged and at this pace i'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine it might be a better idea to get somewhere else	3
0	i dont enjoy this publication at all anymore dont know if editorial leadership has change	3
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price it is too expensive marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription it was paid for in advance thru amazon i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice they are reporting me to a credit agency for non payment avoid them avoid them they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating	3
0	this magazine used to be thick fun to read full of information but that was about 5 years ago now it 's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non sense the editorial is almost always filled with political opinions i wo n't renew my subscription	3
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine they had no problem charging my credit card but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year what a bunch of nonesense	3
0	this is one of the worse magazines i have picked up in years if you have money to burn traveling then it might be for you loaded with advertising and little 'true' content	3
0	i ordered on 10 4 2005 as of march 27th i still have n't received the first issue i do n't even want it now ! how do i get credit for the payment made back in october	3
0	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it \? \? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it	3
0	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
0	please see tj mccarthy 's review elsewhere here he is to borrow a phrase from across the pond spot on in his comments just this week i cancelled my 10 year subscription to pc magazine one thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor jim louderback has dropped the old tagline on the front cover an independent guide to technology i conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is in fact just a marketing vehicle for various products if you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing stay away from this publication	3
0	i remember not quite four years ago when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc oriented market now it 's thin hollow interminably off topic and ad choked	3
0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year old grandson for some reason ziff davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine \( dec 27 2005 p 122 if you want to check it out \) previous issues had partial page ads selling sex pheremones which i could almost overlook but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line	3
0	just from picking up this mag in the store and reading their spin off pocket gaming i have concluded that this magazine is pure rubbish i would n't waste my money subscribing	3
0	this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit it 's filled with many success stories but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success it 's also extremely geared towards franchising every other article and every other ad is about franchising i have a one year subscription and at this point i'm bored i 'll keep the subscription but it 's highly unlikely that i will renew next year though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur com you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine and will prove to be a great wealth of information	3
0	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group we were sorely disappointed most of the articles are not new information but quot rehashed quot info widely available we read it cover to cover for about 4 months then cancelled the subscription there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !	3
0	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription true each issue would be more expensive but1 \) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying as some are thin and empty2 \) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue i have only gotten one issue on time to be honest	3
0	i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine is n't worthy of its title i subscribed before reading review i was hoping to find an affordable psychology based read though some stories are interesting i'm sure i 'd be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo and there is plenty of ads probably more than stories and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it it took forever for the first issue to arrive now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	3
0	the latest pshycology today had to be trashed the clinic treats abused women and incest and rape victims lust did n't go over well	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
0	this is probably the best music movie magazine out today however you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for 8 95 or something this deal is bs	3
0	where are all of my magazine subscription first issues \? \? \? \? \? \? \? mar	3
0	this is definitely the inferior rag of the big trio of science monthlies filled with poorly written articles i actually went back to home depot once to get a refund for this magazine it is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine this magazine promotes commercial products and no i'm not talking about the advertisements but the actual articles themselves the magazine is not a news magazine it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in if you like paying for ads go for it	3
0	they may have some good info but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads and within the ads a lot of scams and mlm schemes buyer beware	3
0	i got charged for this and havent gotten it what bulls	3
0	i still have not received this magazine what is taking so long ! !	3
0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	3
0	i got my first month \( a horrible green day issue \) and then nothing ! uh what up \? its not that good of a magazine i just want what i paid for	3
0	spin will do anything to try and stay hip i wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their quot tribute quot to kurt cobain mag im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures they were poorly written and dull they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt 's music and his impact on an entire generation i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin	3
0	love to review history today but have n't seen a copy yet any ideas	3
0	why \? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it has nothing to do with natural health it has to do with advertisements it is empty completelly more it looks like a woman magazine but i believe that a clever woman would feel like i feel now angry ! i paid for something that i believed but it is not ok we make mistakes	3
0	was n't worth the subscription i found the magazine to be bland full of ads and basically boring all the information can be found doing a quick web search highly disappointed	3
0	i loved this magazine in 1995 until a few years ago they have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads no new information glossy pics of models with bright red lips what is about health here \? get life extension magazine and alternative medicine magazine they 've changed too over the last few years but still a far sight better than this one	3
0	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3
0	nice cover pictures and headlines but way too many ads there 's a reason its only twelve bucks this is an ad sponsored mag	3
0	i send away for a 2 year subscription they sent me a 1 year sub i wrote 5 letters sent copies of bank cheque and order form emailed them no response they could care less what more can i do \?	3
0	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !	3
0	do n't pay amazon 34 for this subscription when you can get it directly from national geographic for 15	3
0	esquire is a subpar men 's magazine in my opinon more than half of the magazine is advertisements and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and or thought provoking if you like ads and cologne samples pick it up after all it is pretty decently priced	3
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature stupid and boring the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste do n't bother	3
0	the writing seems to have come from under educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool i was n't sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles this magazine is n't for men it 's for boys however the one star is for the photos of the women which we ca n't deny both men and boys can appreciate	3
0	i 've at various times subscribed to stuff maxim and fhm magazines stuff was the only one i ended up not resubscribing to it has its moments and the photography is fine i would describe it as maxim 's younger brother it 's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny etc but it is forced and very juvenile it just is snarky and predictable after awhile on the other hand i'm not 21 anymore either and maybe if i was in my 20 's i would find this the height of humor	3
0	have n't received this item it has been almost 2 months	3
0	this mag needs a new editor i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests	3
0	this magazine is a waste of money and bores me nothing here to see but ads	3
0	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine with its overwhelming amount of advertising takes away from any good points i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts i rarely find anything i 'd want to save overall a disappointment	3
0	bad journalism and plenty of adds if you like to exoticize black people then this is your mag nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost	3
0	where are the critiques \? the articles lack any critical substance whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype vibe will go along with the flow on top of that there are more ads now than ever before even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space	3
0	i would n't know if this was a good magazine i have yet to receive it after waiting three months it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway	3
0	the editor 's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine which you 'll enjoy only if you 're like her rich creepily entitled self absorbed and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining but not really food or actual cooking itself	3
0	i subscribed to food amp wine for a while and was continuously disappointed the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad this magazine ca n't hold a candle to quot bon appetit quot or quot gourmet quot	3
0	i ordered a subscription for my step son and a gift for a niece at the same time they took my money and both of the one year subscriptions i paid for only resulted in one issue to each child i could n't get any more information on the magazine as we never received any more informaiton until i got an e mail from amazon asking me to renew i noticed another recent post with the same problem the magazine was really great and my step son and niece both waited and waited for their next issue which never showed how disappointing i would n't take the chance if i were you ld	3
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
0	i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine since i already got parents i chose child i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up the magazine is boring the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages if you want a magazine about parenting kids go with parents	3
0	as a professional photographer i think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way the images are predictable and unimaginative and have n't changed in the past 25 years there are much better magazines to read	3
0	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	3
0	as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor 's office and reading it because it was the only thing available it has not changed much there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content this magazine will neither stretch your child 's mind nor keep him entertained it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen in the coming era of global connection children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia	3
0	i ordered this magazine a year ago and my nephew still have n't receive a single magazine ! every time i email customer service they would tell me that it 's coming next month i will let you how the magazine is when i get it but do n't hold your breath	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
0	sure i like a mystery who does n't \? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story the tales are hard edged and lacking in style and substance we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment the value for money is horrible the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge alfred hitchcock would not be proud	3
0	i ordered the magizine subsribtion and when i ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks so i went out and bought that months issue a few weeks later that issue came which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that i hadnt even ordered my subsription that month	3

0	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine beware beware beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way r tully is great about responding to emails it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly if at all i recommend cooking light it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy	3
0	great magazine but beware of subscriptions my subscription was paid for back in august '06 and i have yet to see a copy \( january '07 \) their customer service have assured me twice that they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives plus the phone number they provided is not in service ! its a shame because the magazine looks to be really well done	3
0	after reading the reviews and description i have ordered intermezzo for a relative for two years they were too polite to tell me that they have only received four magazines \( one a duplicate \) in that time period and have n't been able to get the magazine 's customer service to correct the problem it does n't feel good to give a gift that ends up being a pain to the recipient and they still do n't have it take a pass	3
0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer they might as well call this the robb report they only test highend cars and the best ones are the ones that go 0 60mph the quickest not ride nice or get good mpg	3

0	this magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away i was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside but the articles are very short and pointless it was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they do n't know what their doing	3
0	this is a magazine for paid product placement in articles tons of ads and so so articles you are paying for the name and getting much less in return i highly recommend fine homebuilding instead of this old house you will not only see fabulous new and old construction but actually take something away from it \( that is the point behind magazines right \? \) a magazine that actually saved me money ! i'm cancelling my subscription to t o h and adding another year onto my fine homebuilding subscription it 's money well spent	3
0	what can be said \? the show sucks and the magazine is just an ad for it ! wow that 's impressive just makes you wonder how much money the this old house folks are swimming in does n't it yep ! look at all the 1 star reviews does n't that signal you not to buy it \? does n't it \? local crazy monke	3
0	vogue knitting does not have customer service strange as it sounds i 've bought subscription through amazon and received 1 issue i since moved to another state and all my magazines followed me except vogue knitting all pleas e mails and other attempts to communicate with magazine failed its been over 6 months and 2 missing issues and i still dont have my magazine probably wo n't on the other hand why would vogue knitting worry about lonely subscriber whose money they long spent	3
0	i ordered and paid in full \( through amazon \) for a gift subscription to vogue kitting last christmas 2005 the recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion it is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money ! the content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star	3
0	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago and still have n't received a single issue i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail they have my money but i do n't have a magazine	3

0	gd usa is a monthly magazine targeted at and available free to professionals within the graphic design community it consists overwhelmingly of promotional material advertising company profiles personal profiles and so on if you are not in the business you will find little of interest here if you are in the business you can get the magazine free from their website	3
0	i agree with the others in that this magazine is too content filled with the most irrelevant content ! the copy is way heavy but few true words of wisdom it showcases very little work by other graphic designers so if you 're looking to peruse the latest talent definitely stick with ca or how	3
0	this magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is when they do focus on the best work of the design community their examples are puzzling they choose work that is often genuinely awful and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows \( comarts adc graphis aiga one club \) while that would be admirable had they found other good work most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best there is a reason this magazine is free	3
0	although 'camping life' does contain a nice article or two each issue the thrust of the magazine seems more to be a showcase of nice big campers rv 's rather than the experience of camping and related camping activities i subscribed sight unseen from the boy next door who was selling subscriptions for school i will definitely let this subscription lapse there 's just not enough love of camping and the outdoors in the magazine however if your camping interests run more to great big rv 's and all the related gear you might find some value here that i did not	3
0	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas it 's june and she has yet to get a copy i called them in march and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer i 'll going to ask for a refund	3
0	i ordered in november and i am still waiting to receive this item	3
0	do n't get me wrong i love the two hard cover books real simple solutions and real simple the guide to organized living they are gems however the magazine simply betrays it 's words as one rater stated it seems like the reader is cajoled into buying un needed expensive products and my god the magazine is cluttered with ads and inserts plus it is very hard to turn the pages and read i realize ads are necessary but this is extreme especially for a magazine that supposedly promotes a less complicated and cluttered life for it 's readers	3
0	this magazine should really be titled quot better living through buying stuff quot it 's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription the only important thing i 've learned is how to fold a sweater i will not be renewing	3
0	calling all brighton mums ! this magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design smothered in advertising for crisp white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops a pretty lousy effort as australia 's top selling interior design magazine though designed for the wealthy mainstream brighton market vogue interiors will satisfy anyone who does n't quite know what the colour brown will quot work quot with vi 's current editor is david clark art director is anna utzon and interior design editor is matt page	3
0	i ordered this magazine on 10 7 06 \( over three months ago \) and haven t received a single copy yet ! ! ! stinky service ! !	3
0	it 's almost as if this magazine writes it 's stories 2 mounths in advance onces you get the latest copy it 's news that has been repeated 7961 583 times it does however have decent posters \( that 's why it got a 2 and not just 1 \) but thats about the only thing that this magazine has to offer	3
0	i don`t like this magazine it is so boring the gossip is lame and dry and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say omg another hd poster for my room ! ! there`s hardly any real pages just regular old posters teens beware you will be disappointed and totally bored this is a magazine for girls aged 9 12 strictly for tweens	3
0	this magazine tries hard but its quality is perhaps the lowest in the woodworking magazine field photos not lighted well illustrations lacking in detail and lots of rambling text pretty much sums it up the annual tool issue is a wasted issue imho	3
0	knitters take note i purchased what was titled as anna burda knitting needlecrafts english ed what arrived was anna needlework and crafts which contains very little knitting i should have looked at the photo of the magazine cover in the ad which displays the needlework crafts cover since i ca n't find the magazine conveniently in my north mississippi area i 'll shell out another 50 bucks and order from the publisher i guess	3
0	i too have stacks of organic gardening and farming i love to go back and visit robert rodale too bad it has become a political bullypulpit i would not subscribe again with out a major change	3
0	the magazine is not bad marginal at best to my surprise i am now a member of a club i also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books \( mine to keep for a small fee \) needless to say the description for the magazine was not forthcoming with the additional items and obligations \( mailing the book back etc \) all i wanted was the magazine i do n't like to feel like i was taken advantage of please pass on this one there are plenty of other good gardening magazines to order	3
0	after ordering this magazine it sems that i 've got a gardening membership which was okay i guess but now i 've got some book sitting in my office that i can preview for 10 days and decide to keep for the low low cost of only you get the picture all i wanted was a gardening magazine if i wanted to join a book club or a gardening club than i would have i really feel like i was decieved by the discription of this magazine and now i get the joyful fun of returning items i do n't want or getting charged for them yeah !	3
0	unfortunately i have not received the item it 's been 4 5 weeks since i placed the order i am reviewing this a low star it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription	3
0	i really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80 90 100 straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy they are all very helpful no matter what your playing ability i think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons unfortunately golf magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months i wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as t amp l golf or the golfer	3
0	it takes too much time to receive the first book i have n't received the first book yet	3
0	this magazine is published by the same people that brought us maxim so if you like maxim check it out if you do n't pass the pictures are slick models are attractive but there is little in the way of information on how to do it yourself or what was actually done to the bike it is basically a picture book if you are looking for technical articles how tos or performance installs check out road bike for metrics or hot bike or american iron for harleys and victory 's	3
0	i have n't received my subscription to sunset magazine yet i ca n't review the actual magazine but i can say they are very slow at getting new orders out	3
0	as is typical of many magazines sunset jams it to existing subscribers they offered me a deal to re subscribe for 12 months for 29 95 ! here on amazon i can get two years \( 24 months \) for 29 95 magazines need to understand basic marketing it takes a lot of advertising dollars \( mailings \) to get a new subscriber once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business	3

0	during the 1970s bicycling was a great magazine with lots of in depth articles about bike tours bike racing and bicycle technology the magazine zoomed downhill through the 1990s into the worthless rag that it is now the articles in the current version of the magazine are very superficial and lifeless many are thinly veiled press releases from various advertisers if you really want to learn about road bicycles and bicycling a much better magazineis cyclingplus for mountain biking try bike or dirt rag	3

0	i have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months	3
0	unfortunately as this subscription has not yet started i am not in a position to comment or review	3
0	i'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is there 's nothing wrong with celebrity mags but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially it 's about as deep as an e ! true hollywood story about kato kaelin i 've tried many times but alas this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it	3
0	still have not received an issue yet please give me an update as to when the first one will arrive	3
0	do not order they only placed an order for 7 months but i got billed for 12 after 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it after pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription only order from the magazine itself	3
0	loved the magazine but after two years of it the onslaught of mostly bare chested men both in the mag and on the cover was too much where are the women \? if it is targeting the gay audience please say so each month i 'd count the number of men vs women photos and there are very few women just unshaven boys not my cup of tea so my subscription has n't been renewed	3

0	i use to buy this magazine every mouth when i was much younger which was just a big waste of money all the stories and pictures can be found in any other teen bop magazine this magazine is not for people who can actually read or understand any of the stories	3
0	i started reading this magazine because i needed something to read but i stopped right away thr articles are pointless because you can buy another magazine and see the same information and same with the pictures the editors of this magazine put exclamation points basically after every single sentence none of which were exciting at all maybe i just hate pop star ! just because i do n't care for celebrity magazines or maybe not but the only people i would recommend this magazine to is children under 10 years of age	3
0	i cook almost everything from scratch so i figured home cooking would be for people like me who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines instead recipes consist of packaged dough in a can bottled sauces etc i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !	3
0	i made the mistake of subscribing to make based on the hype it turns out to be long and tedious with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use successive issues have gone down hill and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people 's garage workshops maybe you 'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe it 's not obviously wonderful	3

0	i ordered this magazine as a gift not only was there no gift card sent but the company sent the magazine to me instead of gift recipient it took about 20 minutes on the phone with the subscription company to fix the problem and not once was there any mention of an apology for the inconvenience the biggest disappointment was not having a gift on time !	3

0	i ordered hamptons magazine through amazon com back in october 2004 i am still waiting for my first issue to arrive	3
0	the magazine is very nice with color pictures and recipes that look okay but that ingredients are either rare or expensive the magazine is too fancy and it 's hard to find what the recipe is like they do n't put a review you have to tell for yourself and plus if it does n't have a picture you have to guess what 's in it i rate it one star i 'd rate it a half star if there was such thing but there is n't i would n't buy this magazine	3
0	big publication little unique coverage the mag is very repetitive and lacking almost no womens coverage gee are they not very hard working cycling athletes as well \? the same big name riders are always mentioned definetly a us publication not covering an international sport may have done more harm than good to cycling with the covers and article structure in 2005 having a lopsided somewhat sensationalized view of the doping issue i would n't subscribe again there are too many other good to excellent choices available	3
0	an anti catholic newspaper in a catholic town \( this peculiar quality of the paper existed long before the priest child sex abuse scandal in the area \) whether you are a catholic or not the paper 's anti catholic bias makes one wonder why it has such an ax to grind and wonder too if the paper does not hold other prejudices its factual reporting often times reads more like editorials it has elitist pretensions without the quality to back them up i live in the boston area and am exasperated with the globe i prefer reading the new york times	3
0	i'm very disappointed with this magazine it seems to be a total waste of money i found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2 3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas but it 's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something i can use	3
0	truth be told i hated having to give this magazine even one star but that was the least i could do via this rating system this magazine has some good writers but needs a new editor mr shoaf is very bad at his job clearly and seems to use and reuse the buddy system in using writers perhaps he gets a kickback \? at any rate this is overall a cruddy example of journalism my facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction in many issues i am done with it get a new editor and perhaps i will reinvestigate the publication until then so long i have no time for absolute rubbish	3

0	but over the last 10 years it has just become another muscle mag that uses t a to prop up its bodybuilders i'm surprised its still around	3
0	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to take a ride on the creativity of others my advice do not purchase read or advertise in this third rate publication there is little more credibility or validity than watching jerry springer please do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only	3
0	amazon sells a one year subscription for 14 which includes a 5 amazon certificate that you get later in the actual magazine the subscription card is 6 99 for one year or 2 years for 10 00so use the card save some money and also dont have to wait for your 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the 5 certificate on	3
0	for some strange reason i began receiving this magazine in the mail never ordered never paid for my conclusion based on reading the last three issues you 're kidding me how can time inc still publish this rag \? what 's the point	3
0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living i was actually appalled by this magazine it is ostensibly health conscious but upon closer examination it ignores important health information for example in one issue it had a whole article about diabetes and how thanks to the miracles of science diabetics can now eat sugary foods it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet i was disappointed with the magazine	3
0	i used to love light tasty then they decided to change the look and format even though reader surveys said keep it the same the new look is hard to read and lacks the down home feel that makes the magazines popular there are less pictures of the finished dishes and the pictures they do show are smaller they added full page ads for thier country store products which goes against the no ad promise i have subscribed for years but this new look is horrible get it at the store to see if you like it first	3
0	the pantings are nice and colorful and mostly in oil but not enough technique shown to really be of help	3
0	the adage holds steady with this magazine what to the hip consumer appears to be a hopeful window into the world of cool turns out to be completely empty it would be insulting how hard they try to represent the scene of new york if it were n't so embarrassing get the village voice try the other coast with interview just stay away from this disgusting fluff	3
0	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable ladies my advice is to save your money for a different magazine i dont recommend glamour at all	3

0	where 's the content in this magazine ads ads ads they try and make themselves out to be a great golf travel magazine but i have seen much better in other publications i agree with the woman from england links loads up on these inserts i like to read a magazine like the golfer where they travel all over the world and review spectacular courses from the carribbean to new zealand	3
0	this magazine makes girls who feel geeky and nerdy bad and girls who are normal teens who have crushes and like to stay in style terrible ! plus this magazine is sexist ! it does n't have models anywhere because it says that it makes girls feel bad ! if you want a magazine that is good and inspires read american girls or girls life !	3
0	it is hard to review a magazine that i have yet to receive even though it was order 12 04 2005 please let me know when i can expect to receive my 1st issue	3
0	what is it with these gossip magazines \? \? please tell me because i truly think no one in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage all it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds while not having anything important else in the magazine unless your 10 years old do not subscribe to this there are better magazines out there fortunately like seventeen and cosmogirl ! which are n't nearly as filled with garbage like this the reason you do n't see j 14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people it 's for little kids and it 's not mature period	3
0	like a reviewer below said this magazine was good a while back try back in 2002 it used to have better tips and less filler now it 's all filler seriously there are maybe 5 quizzes which do n't say much a dream decoder which is complete phooey and yes the many tweeny posters that i 'd be embarassed to have on my wall even if i were 11 i grew but sadly this magazine did not let alone stay the same nothing is serious in here it 's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read age reccomendation 9 12simply put this magazine is like m magazine but not as infantile	3
0	how 's j lo doing \? are jennifer and brad pitt still together \? what are the olsen twins up to \? is orlando bloom a hottie or what \? \? well who the hell cares \? \? \? i got better things to care about than some news about these celebrities people i 've never actually met let alone know please teenagers should be steered away from this kind of worthless trashy magazine \( other examples include seventeen ym teen people and the list goes on \) there are other issues which happen to be more important you know try national geographic or the new yorker instead the newspapers are also good	3
0	i have never received a copy of this magazine that i ordered in august of last year ! they did n't hesitate to take my money though ! i have no idea if the magazine has any redeemable articles in it at all	3
0	i received this magazine as a gift and i will not renew articles are very short and refer you to websites telephone numbers etc for more information why so little information in the magazine itself \? additionally there is a load of advertising take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long for my money there is much more available elsewhere including a google search waste of paper imho	3
0	when i bought this magazine subscription i was under the impression that is for the cosmo that is sold printed in spain i was wrong when my first issue arrived i see that it 's nothing more than the united states english version translated into spanish these 2 magazines are very different in content while i 'll read this i will not renew just a heads up for anyone who wants to purchase this magazine	3
0	the company is taking for ever to send me the magazines i ordered they has charged my account over 3 months ago and not yet deliver a single copy of its magazines when i call the company they dont have a number to call or a way they can be accounted for their wrong doing iwant my magazines or my money back not any more sory we are sendingt it to you	3

0	you know blush magazine \? its fictional headquarters are the set of the nbc sitcom just shoot me you read their headlines and article ideas and you know they 're based on this little piece of waste ! what shocks me is that i know 13 year old girls get their dose of sex and guys information from it very shallow they try to be so sophisticated it ends up being naive ! stay away from i	3
0	as a new elementary art teacher i do not find school arts to be a very helpful magazine at all other educators write in general ideas about lessons to teach but do not specifically outline materials vocabulary procedures safety cautions steps or ways to integrate art lessons with general subject areas i was also hoping for large posters to use with lessons the posters and art lessons in instructor magazine are much more hands on and usefull also because the magazine has lessons for all ages and grades there are only a couple of lessons to work with on the elementary level i will not renew my subscription on this magazine new copies i receive lay around unopened and useless	3
0	we paid for a 12 month subscription and i got the magazine for about 4 months i could n't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money i did n't get a 12 month subscription i got ripped off plus when i did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up very disapointing	3
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift and so far the first two issues have been sent to me rather than to the intended gift recipient there must be a better way to handle gift subscriptions i supplied the address of the gift recipient when i placed this order the same thing happened last year and i do not intend to order gifts from amazon again	3
0	i used to subscribe to this when it was all natural then overnight they went to all drugs and sleaze and childish nonsense i tried to get a refund but was ignored unable to cancel my subscription i simply threw it into the trash can each month before my children would see it i hate this magazine and would not allow it in my house once it was filled with nothing but drugs and insults thank god there are much better alternatives actually any magazine any where is better if and when they switch back to all natural i may buy it again until then no way ! !	3
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles profanity porn and blurry black and white photos it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost	3
0	this is great if you 're a hobbyist or a maker of hotel no motel paintings sucks if you 're not	3
1	i was sceptical at first but after getting a few of the magazines i really got into the way they looked at the whole body health and did n't just focus on body exercises like most magazines	3
1	great conservative political journalism would 've liked to read it when william buckley was editor	3
1	old mac usr new mac usr matters not there is something in this magazine for everyone and icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too	3
1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks however even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials top notch magazine and highly recommended just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this as well as a few other of their excellent magazines here in the states	3
1	i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best bar none the houses featured are absolutely dreamy the photography is gorgeous and while the magazine does n't offer how to decorating ideas there is so much inspiration i find it to be intelligently written which is rare in a decorating magazine the articles on antiques are particularly informative this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful classic design whether or not you live in the south	3
1	as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose	3
1	i was very surprised by the reviews below because i found this magazine absolutely wonderful ! ! the articles range from architecture to renovated homes to specific garden types to the average home owner i found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well the pictures are great and i find myself tearing things out every month ! fantastic for anyone interested in design art or interior decorating	3
1	i 've read the new yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then it is still a very good magazine now as magazines go it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published for good writing reporting cartoons and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine and their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue i do n't believe any issue in all the years i 've read it has n't had at least a couple items of interest with some of the issues being read from front cover to back try a copy it might just be for you semper fi	3
1	although i often disagree with the 'new yorker' politically and find the writing of seymour hersh offensive i believe that the 'new yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non fiction i stress the non fiction because this is what interests me in 'the new yorker now' once it was the fiction of salinger singer of s j perelman but in recent years it has been the writing of malcolm gladwell adam gopin and a number of others this is without speaking of the special feeling of class the new yorker gives its still topnotch cartoons the 'on the town' feature and the first rate 'talk of the town ' calendar	3
1	i love this magazine ! it has up to the minute need to know celeb news honestly most of the time what they say in these tabloid magazines turns out to be true jessica simpson split and brad and angelina jen and vince just to name a few also there's movie dvd music reviews makeup and fashion tips and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb i look forward to each week getting this magazine	3
1	what is not to like from cover to cover all beautiful models and international models great magazine	3
1	harper 's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine second only to instyle it is great and packed with great fashion it actually does have some good articles too that i thoroughly enjoy reading \( the articles are much better than the ones in elle \) if you can only get one sub get instyle if you can get two get instyle and harper 's bazaar it is well worth the money	3
1	harper 's bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there nothing compared to the always disappointing vogue better fashions editorials articles that i actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics the true bible if you want to be in style	3
1	i absolutely love this magazine it not only has tons of helfpul fitness tips but it does not require you be a size 2 the self fitness challenge is my favorite part of the year	3
1	i have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years this is the magazine that impatiently wait for every month it has beauty tips interesting articles fitness information etc i even gave my mother a gift subscription it 's the best	3
1	loved this magazine they had such great articles and tips that saved my sanity ! loved it and highly recommend it	3
1	this magazine is so delightful ! fantastic tutorials great photos and wonderful info i enjoy it very much and would n't hesitate to subscribe again i heartily recommend it	3
1	after reading several digital photography books and going to grad school classes i found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country there are many articles on artists workshop type tutorials as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan i believe this magazine has something for everyone from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost in addition i have found two other british publications digital camera world and digital photography techniques \( both at www dcmag co uk \) that i would strongly recommend for those who can afford them	3
1	this magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in new york city that week the magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it you can just skip to the section you 're interested in there 's a whole city out there to discover and tony can help point you in the right direction	3
1	fhm is absolutely gorgeous ! hot and sexy covers great entertainment and fashion info men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost	3
1	this magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men it has everything you want including hot babes cars gadgets and sexy bikinis it is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff like the new watches they showed by fossil and dkny and some excellent martini recipes and then they turned me on to a dvd called new sex now which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies i for one am hooked	3
1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified thanks so much	3
1	i am a huge nelson fan and thought i was the only one left until i visited their website www thenelsonbrothers com they are as hot as ever ! since after the rain they have released six more cd 's i highly recommend the brother harmony cd or the like father like sons cd where they honor their late great father rick nelson by bringing back his music they are currently available to come to your hometown and put on a performance that will leave you wanting more to contact information on booking them for your area please contact them atwww nelsontourinfo com hey it 's an awesome experience to see them in action sincerely kay javen	3
1	touchstone is one of the better magazines journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past the editors numerous in number are orthodox roman and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church in other words they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together and by extension sanitizes and sanctifies culture first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well enjoy !	3
1	this is one of the best dog magazines of all time the issues just keep getting better and better this magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed breeds as well it has wonderful rescue related stories one of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of npr that comparison really opened my eyes as i have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by npr	3
1	conde nast traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want a bees the magazine is geared mostly to north america and europe it tells where to eat shop or be seen on the two continents for example an article will inform the reader of a new five star sushi restaurant in florence italy thus if you plan to travel to florence for sushi \( not michelangelo \) this is the magazine for you it is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler for the pictures are gorgeous	3
1	this is a great travel magazine wonderful pictures and stories it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel leisure so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal be aware though the items in this magazine are not very cheap unfortunately go with another magazine \( arthur frommer 's budget travel \) if you want to find travel baragains	3
1	i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	3
1	nice replacement for my oprah magazine like the concise and to the point articles good suggestions sprinkled in magazine very heavy with the advertisements but then the ads rip out quickly leaving a more simple real simple read	3
1	real simple is exactly what the name implies there is no clutter on the pages which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi task well and never throw anything away	3
1	this magazine compares favorably to quot american heritage quot with its interesting and accessible but well researched accounts of the past each issue focuses on a person \( i just read the story of thomas aquinas and had n't realized his fascinating interaction with muslims \) or a movement \( the huguenots who 's sad history led to their dispersal from france to all over the world including the revere family moving to massachusetts \) all in all an intriguing glimpse at how christians of the past continue to influence us today	3
1	my students really enjoy this magazine it always contains very humorous things that my students love i teach students in grades 3 4 and 5 and it is always checked out from my classroom library i would recommend it to parents and students \( as long as they watch nickelodeon \)	3
1	with its weekly distribution there is almost too much information articles are balanced and cover a wide range of topics quickly responds with articles about new concepts and ideas	3
1	i have reviewed two issues so far the articles are practacal and challenging well worth the investment for someone working on a manuscript	3
1	this is my favorite magazine i subscribe to a lot of them but always end up reading this one the most keep up the good work	3
1	i'v been taking this mag since it was called boot it still has the best overall info for builders but they are starting to get a little trendy in their pages	3
1	i ordered this magazine for my husband and he ca n't wait to get each issue ! he especially loves the free cd dvd that come with each issue he 's heard alot of cool new music and read up alot on some of his favorite bands	3
1	as an aging 53 appreciator of music i find paste to be a welcome read every time it shows up in my mailbox granted i do not know every artist mentioned in the magazine nor do i care to but the artists i do follow are treated with respect and with a sense of genuine interest ! the cd that comes with the magazine will help you decide beforehand whether or not to purchase that winterpills or eddie spaghetti cd ! as previously mentioned in another review the print can be small and my reading glasses are always nearby ! gre	3
1	this is my 1 favorite decor magazine it 's full of very creative ways to decorate with antique furniture and linens the end result is classy and ecletic and something everyone could do	3
1	one of my favorite magazines ! i would'nt live w out it ! thanx ! artchalet msn co	3
1	i like the different projects and items you can buy plus they give prices and online addresses overall i'm quite pleased with this magazine	3
1	an outstanding magazine even if all you wish to do is look at the pictures great ideas and for a great price	3
1	i read the nation for its poetry katha pollitt and takes on the news it 's a left wing magazine i do n't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect objectivity humans have opinions and viewpoints even time magazine and the national review have viewpoints	3
1	some articles are out dated why iraq appears in every issue so borin	3
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day and he really likes it recommend it	3
1	great magazine keeps nyers informed of what 's going on in the city and has a great crossword puzzle to boot	3
1	new york magazine is the flag bearer for new york is the center of the universe belief it meets this goal in dishing up news gossip reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis \( how else can one get away with call shopping strategy \? \) the magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery \( example an article on the 2nd best cities in the world \) it turns up the restaurants stories and culture that make nyc such a fantabulous place it 's worth diminishes rapidly though the further one gets from the big apple	3
1	american spectator mag is an oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of liberalism ! mr emitt tyrell has got to be the coolest guy to ever put together a magazine the information is fantastic the intellect captivating i highly reccommend it to everyone	3
1	the american spectator offers an eloquent and often humorous conservative viewpoint on the more pressing political and cultural issues facing the world today the emphasis here is conservatism not republicanism as tas is often highly critical of gop politics and policies that stray from conservative ideals publications like tas counter the insidious tendentious underpinings of the mainstream media hollywood and the mistake that is the united nations i recommend you at least give it a look samples of its content can be found at www spectator or	3
1	i enjoy the vibe of this magazine the q a's are truly interesting to me to say the least overall very entertaining un cut it has a up front vibe take on things not like other magazines that is for sure	3
1	okay so the pictures of the girls are not my thing but where else can you read a fresh look about cars eating healthy and fashion \? ladies this is a must read in order to talk to men ! it features fun topics sure to entertain and assist in carrying conversation with all the guys	3
1	i 've been a subscriber for several years now i was trying to decide between maxim and stuff i chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining \( i e how to do doughnuts in your car ect \) they do have some photos of actors and such but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of i would suggest this magazine	3
1	this is the magazine for windows it pros i have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at windows nt magazine over time it has gotten thinner but the articles are as informative as ever	3
1	i was so happy to pick up meridian it 's a great mix of fiction and poetry and i could n't put it down until i finished it	3
1	i started reading the economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years that was 9 years ago reason blended with wit and intelligence the articles in the economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers once i get my weekly edition you could n't blow torch it out of my hands \( my wife has tried \) the economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective free markets civil liberties and skepticism of those in power in my opinion it has no competitors i could n't rate it highly enough	3
1	most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite this is the only weekly newsmag i can stand to read and i love to read it us news is a grab bag of topics international is excellent \( vs other us sources of news \) finance business is excellent science is a grab bag books arts is quite good and the periodic special reports are great cheeky and clear a delight to read bring your skepticism though because the reporters columnists are not shy about taking a position and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion	3
1	too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists \( such as those that work for fox news \) the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america 's it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world from politics to economics to science to the arts best of all the articles \( except for the special report \) are concise allowing for an easy read	3
1	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture' feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed	3
1	aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout although ostensively devoted to art photography many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism if you are primarily interested in just art photography and can subscribe only to one magazine i would suggest blind spot	3
1	i received my first magazine it is n't glossy or flashy but is full of in depth info which is exactly what i wanted not very thick for the money but i'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content	3
1	this newsletter is a great resource for dog people the articles are well researched detailed and best of all applicable i keep them in a binder and often refer back to earlier issues if i have a health or training concern about my dogs \( and have been known to share them with friends \) both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great i definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs	3
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements it 's pure holistic news information health nutrition training food testing and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing it 's not always easy to get information that is up to date helpful and necessary with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge	3
1	the whole dog journal should be mandatory for anyone that loves their dog the information found in this magazine is the best i have ever seen regarding the health and happiness of any dog the editor and contributing writers are the best in the dog world they tell the whole truth about dogs that you will not find anywhere and this information can and has been lifesaving you will not find better information anywhere	3
1	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name however i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light but there is so much more always an article on a travel destination an article on beauty and an article on a sport as well as other constants the theme of the magazine is total healthy living incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive	3
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! this is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries ! the magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones a wonderful magazine	3
1	the new yorker has made it 's way to our kitchen table since i was tall enough to see over the edge of the table my mom was an avid reader and now i buy the magazine cause she would have wanted it that way i like it for the cartoons and i'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics so i need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on with all the blogging and other nonsense i feel secure that the new yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something so i rely on it where i wo n't rely on news printed on the internet regards lar	3
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism fiction reviews and of course cartoons all written by some of the best writers in the land it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers but one word of caution if you 're the type of person that whines liberal bias at anything that you slightly disagree with then this is not the magazine for you	3
1	filter and under the radar are the only music magazines i come near i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i'm a little too close minded to care about other genres i do n't care much about fans of rock pop what the kids are calling indie alternative punk post punk folk ! ! ! ! take a gander at this and the covers are slick and durable they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table	3
1	most magazimes half of their pages is advertizmet this one have something to say and did make me some money when i used their top 10 stock picks for next year that was january 99 the semiconductor boom all 10 out of 10	3
1	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine the primary difference is the longer well written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail if you do n't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy	3
1	foreign policy is a terrific journal it goes beyond the conventional wisdom in an effective manner topics are well chosen orientation is not as predictable as new republic or tendentious as an academic journal good links and bibliography stimulating arguments and perspectives i enjoy it recommend it and often give subscriptions to friends	3
1	this magazine provides interesting stories and information about american history and cultural life most often it is very pleasant reading	3
1	since first getting this mag from gamestop as one of those free add on things you get when you buy games there i have come to really like it unlike other magazines who only seem to care about backing one system or another game informer talks about everything that is going on in the gaming world even addressing the serious issues of children and m rated games	3
1	my son had been wanting a suscription to a gamers mag and going off of the reviews i ordered this one and he thinks its great he is 13 if you are interested	3
1	i 'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years i for one still get something out of the writing ca n't do without my monthly dose of harper 's and the atlantic what i would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on a m 's own website	3
1	i used to read the online content for this magazine \( i still check out the blog \) but i have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online and it 's really worth subscribing the articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues i may not have realized i had a mind to change on i would recommend this magazine to anyone	3
1	for this registered libertarian this is a pretty good magazine decent articles that are written well and easy to read as well as being informative it has been around quite a while and the experience shows \( in a positive way \)	3
1	i look forward to recieving my magazine every month i really love this magazine it has articles marriage sex women 's lives etc i do n't know why the others did n't enjoy it	3
1	despite its controversial past i 've subscribed for years and enjoy this magazine a lot definately a lot of good articles	3

1	since the early 80 's i have been a fan of cemetery dance magazine it comes every other month full of short stories by popular and up and coming horror authors the magazine also contains great movie and book reviews advertising and author interviews i encourage any horror fan to check out their website the staff there is very friendly and helpful on those hot summer days it is a super mag to delve into and forget about the weather ! ! ! ! enjo	3
1	although the stories and interviews in the strand are well worth reading i think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue and at least in the case of john mortimer 's rumpole stories they are taken from forthcoming books that being said the strand is worth the four stars i 've given it but i would describe it as a quot coffee table quot magazine if such a category exists due to its glossy pages large size format and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content	3
1	mother jones is what journalism should be gutsy honest no holds barred investigative reporting regardless of your political party this is one of the last vestages of honest reporting left available to us everything from world news the envirnment american politics and current events is researched thoroughly and reported honestly a must read for people interested in more news than is available the newspaper or in newsweek and time if your tired of the pathetic blather that parades as news these days it 's time for mother jones	3
1	i will always subscribe to this fabulous magazine there is so much variety in each issue i am amazed at how this magazine always get me interested in things that i have never even thought about before and the way the articles are written i feel like i am being entertained while i am being informed it 's awesome ! the mix is not just heavy subjects either there are always ighter weight articles too so i can pick up this magazine on any occasion when i'm in any mood and i can always find something that i want to read about	3
1	this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that pictureimportant they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed \( if it is a person \) this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy	3
1	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3
1	small pieces on the entire world past present and future yum	3
1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3
1	this is the first time i have subscribed to this magazine i really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles	3
1	stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it boo amazon wheres my magazine	3
1	our growing row of everyday food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library but where is the card catelogue \? if i want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that i can make with a particular ingredient i 'd have to flip through hundreds of pages luckily i located a downloadable everyday food index at omninerd com when used together the magazine and index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday	3
1	i actually make the recipes in this magazine the recipes are simple but interesting the nutritional information is also great this is my favorite cooking magazine by far	3
1	i have been getting this magazine for a year now i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis the pictures are pretty the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them	3
1	i never subscribe to anything ! this magazine is great there are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes i'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines are n't that useful to me i might enjoy reading them but i do n't actually use their recipes i 've made 4 of the recipes out of this last everyday food issue and they were very healthy \( lots of veggies chicken brown rice salmon etc \) tasted really good and were also fast which is a bonus for me i 'd give this magazine 10 stars if i could	3

1	one of the most erudite music magazines on the market ! several in depth articles in each issue extensive reviews that do n't fudge candid and critical and lots of pings to bands you 've heard before when reviewing those it 's likely you have n't the only criticism i can think of is that it 's become so big and thick with ads that it 's gotten harder to get thru ! but many of the ads display great graphic design even they are fun	3

1	not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware very fun to read with a unique style of writing the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases the majority though are on target the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds overall a great addition and enjoyable read	3
1	let 's face it owning a mac is like owning a harley or an airstream it 's a cult ! ! ! good fun harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your mac having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price i read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it	3
1	this magazine is totally awesome from the excellent software on the disk to the freakin awesome reviews to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages this magazine is for any mac user who want 's more than the professional macworld can giveprojecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do bu rik myslewski \( spelling \? \) does a great job i totally recommend it	3

1	great magazine this is not my typical type of read because i 've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi media but the great thing about this magazine is that you do n't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos it tells you about them in simple terms too no high tech vocabulary needed i feel informed whenever i read my monthly subscription of the better products to purchase as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies	3
1	no doubt wired is one of the best tech magazines in print but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november i had to call and cancel my subscription i now subscribe directly	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3
1	if oprah made a magazine and it was n't that good i would still read it but luckily she writes a great magazine and it is called o oprah helps starving kids eat and crippled kids walk and that is the kind of neat stuff she puts in her magazine i have to hide my copies of miss whinfrey 's magazine because my brother takes them and tears them up because does not know how great a magazine it is right fellow oprah 's magaine readsers \? \? \? ! ! ! if you want to learn to be a millionairrre with pretty dogs and have lots of people come to chicago to see you you will learn how in this magazine	3

1	the london review of books is without a doubt the best literary journal in the world at the same time erudite entertaining and informative each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob highly recommended	3
1	the london review of books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature the arts culture history politics philosophy published in the world today it now beats the ny review of books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the tls back in the dust if you want to get your bearings in the world of culture and politics this is must reading denis jonneswashington d c kitakyushu japan	3
1	there is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on amazon with the high brow reviews found in the lrb one surveys average readers and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books i brockeim am more like the people than the professionals and believes most of you are as well	3
1	this is by far my favorite magazine the pictures are excellent the articles are informative and hilarious it gives information on movies years in advance and the reviews are reliable the best part about this magazine however is that every time i look through it i find something new	3
1	spike fett is mistaken the 100 greatest moments he mentions is not for all time they were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime which is only 8 years this is one of the best film dvd magazines out there i highly reccomend it it has awesome articles reliable reviews and great color photos another thing i like about it is that its an british publication so you get a different opinion and point of view its a great magazine	3
1	i have been a reader fan of dog world since i had my first dogs in 1981 being an avid dog lover since childhood i have always enjoyed the breeder ads discovering breeds new to me these days one of my favorite sections is the rare breeds i thoroughly enjoy the bi annual all breed special issue although each issue does profile a breed of dog what i like better than dog fancy is that the profiles are more informative in depth dog world also covers rare breeds in their profiles not just akc breeds i would recommend dog world for dog professionals avid dog lovers involved in dog sports and dog fancy for the more casual dog people	3
1	forget about shop etc lucky is the best shopping mag by far i got alot of coupons for full size products an samples inside of lucky magazine i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion makeup hair produts house wares etc	3
1	even if this magazine is a mag a log what would we do without it \? september issue rocks with eva mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside the biggest news \? lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic it 's about time technology got up with our lifestyle	3
1	i actually really love this magazine the articles are down to earth and helpful not cheesy and shallow like those found in cosmo the editorial staff of lucky seems to really relate to real women and are n't bitchy and pretentious like other women 's magazines	3
1	if you are a guy that loves some sexy women of your dreams cop this magazine you might even want to get a 2 year subscription this magazine is full of of sex full figured queens and you can almost bet that the cover girl will always make your heart beat faster and make your mouth water long live the king ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3

1	if you have your own small business or start up or are even slightly thinking about starting one this magazine is well worth the small cost i usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others	3
1	i ordered a free trial of this mag a while back before starting my own e business recently immediately i began a subscription the reviews from pros on real businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel i would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business keeps you informed and in touch	3
1	i subscribe to inc although i am not a business owner yet i find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource as an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller the article on \( \) may 2005 made me aware of a resource that i did know was available check that one out with joe mansueto ceo of morningstar and self confessed fan of inc acquiring the magazine i can only imagine the great things ahead the full page n y times ad reinforces mansueto 's commitment to growing the brand ca n't wait for future issues	3
1	i can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through under the radar on top of that they also write great articles on some of my pre existing favorite bands under the radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there \( devil in the woods rockpile big takeover etc \) and fits my musical tastes perfectly	3
1	under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i'm a little too close minded to care about other genres i do n't care much about fans of rock pop what the kids are calling indie alternative punk post punk folk ! ! ! ! take a gander at this and the covers are slick and durable they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table	3
1	so often when looking through magazines i have n't found quite what i was looking for in the christian literature i like the approach christianity today takes it has articles that are broad and not focused on a specific demonination i believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it i do like the variety of articles and coverage of current events i would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of christianity in the modern world	3
1	this is a decent magazine and it 's good to support an unabashed christian magazine but if sojourners sometimes errors to the left christianity often persistently errors to the the right i subscribe to both and if i find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long i dig back deeper into the bible and then come out in the right place contributor yancey is an inspiration and a true christian voice while colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of ct	3
1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	3
1	if you 're into dope culture or just a straight up toker you gotta check out the times a must have for the intelligent burn lover bud picks price index for usa canada news dope politics grow tips everything the daily puffer needs to know you gotta love this if u chokin' i 'de advise you 2 pick this u	3

1	i 've had a subscription to pc world over the past few years \( as a gift \) and i love it the articles are very insightful and relevant i can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue i'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that i'm looking to buy	3
1	the new york review of books is published 20 times a year biweekly except in january july august and september it is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie it also contains articles of social or political interest the letters section is usually brief with little waste contributors to a recent edition included mark danner sister helen prejean and daniel mendelsohn reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by graham greene and two books about the actress anna may wong in addition to alexander a film directed by oliver stone the new york review of books consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style it definitely deserves its reputation for excellence	3
1	a playground for the mind covers a wide range of subjects each review is a full essay on the subject of the book many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible an on going liberal arts education and the easiest way i know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to	3
1	my husband is a culinary student so i ordered this magazine subscription he looks forward to each issue and is always finding ideas when he reads f amp w i know we 'll subscribe for many years to come this is a fun magazine for those who enjoy cooking both at home or in a professional setting	3
1	this is an excellent magazine but i would have saved 7 00 on an annual subscription by buying it with the enclosed postcard rather than through amazon also i have to wait 12 weeks to receive the first issue ! ! my bad	3
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	as a potential interior designer i find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest i have a subscription and i find that studying the designers the styles and the themes i have learned so much about the work of a designer i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors	3
1	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality it 's an icon all over the world the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi billion dollar industry	3
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3
1	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! !	3
1	people is a great magazine ! it has all the gossip without the drama of some of the other magazines i got my first issue faster than expected ! i ordered sept 22nd and have been reading for 3 or 4 weeks already ! \) if you are looking for a weekly mag this is the one to pick !	3
1	my husband and i love getting our monthly subscription we read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered we often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we 've read about variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together if you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag check out intense games dvd it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality really	3
1	you will see for your self why i like this magazine when you bought it amp did you see her big ass	3
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges \( 6 and 9 \) and is a valuable investment for any parent i do n't know what i would do without this magazine it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car not to mention it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months	3
1	i highly recommend highlights for children it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles hidden pictures games and fun and entertaining stories cynthia marie rizzo author of julie and the unicorn	3
1	i like this one better than cosmo great info on beauty and the like	3
1	i just renewed my subscription to glamour because they are one of the only magazines i have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items \( i e less than 100 \) as well as intelligent relevant articles about women and men sure they have their off months but i really appreciate that ads do n't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others \( especially for as low as the subscription rate is \) i also ca n't wait to see the do 's and do n'ts every month	3
1	i have always enjoyed marie claire i do n't know why i took so long to actually get a subscription it 's a well rounded magazine and well suited for women who are younger and older	3
1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines	3
1	a great magazine that puts the rest of womens magazines to shame this one talks about women 's issues worldwide what you can do to help as well as the more mainstream fashion stuff also not heavy on the advertising like so many a great magazine	3
1	when the armchair detective stopped being published i was without a good mystery magazine i received a complimentary copy of mystery scene and i subscribed to it the magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews i especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers my favorite part is the where are they now which features authors who seem to have stopped writing a particular series many of whom i have read in the past an excellent publication	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	i unfortunately did n't renew my subscription to the week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it i have missed it deeplyt in that time having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories a mixture of news items on all kinds of issues from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative i find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear i cannot say enough good things about the week	3
1	the week always seems to reflect at least three sides to every major story	3
1	the week is a great magazine for anyone who is interested in current events but does n't always have time to consume a lot of media the snippets of world news are interesting and useful the more in depth excerpts tend to be on unusual and interesting topics and the fun fillers \( comics et al \) make it a fun quick read we really enjoy it from cover to cover nothing boring to skip	3
1	i read the review marci carl about the jennifer chiaverini books the quilter'ed apprentice i am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as i am your magazine then i had to go get on the computor and found jennifer 's site now i want to get back into quilting big time my husband just rolls his eyes	3
1	when the publishers of my all time favorite women 's fitness magazine \( muscle fitness hers \) decided to stop producing it i had to find a suitable alternative while it 's not as meaty as muscle fitness hers it 's a good inspiring read it devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup \( and ug even a few celebrities \) but overall i would recommend it at least until something better comes along	3
1	i have been a subscriber of shop etc since its debut when i heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes i ran to subscribe and i have not been disapointed yet ! i love it	3
1	perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who do n't want to even daydream about designer items but it fills a niche that the big magazines such as parents or parenting does not as a previous reviewer stated this is similar to instyle you may not spend 200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2t but it 's fun to look at and maybe get one in a similar style on sale and quite frankly some parents do have the money having expensive items does not make a child spoiled raising a child to believe s he is entitled to it does there are spoiled children across all income levels	3
1	i really enjoyed the first issue sure it is about high end products however this mother is happy to find an alternative to pastels and winnie the pooh	3
1	the smartest best informed and most well entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture i read it cover to cove	3
1	having been a bw subscriber for more than two years i found bw is one of the best business magazines in the us it is funny to see some readers accused bw to be biased granted bw criticized many policies of current administration because they were against long term growth of the economy some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff those policies will do no one 's good business is business for those party faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes they do n't need to read anything intelligent and balanced fox news will be suffecient	3
1	though i oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by the new republic i cannot help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs if for anything else the quality of the writing in this magazine is amazing and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article the group that writes for tnr are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine \( if you do n't like its politics \) all in all this is a fine magazine	3
1	as a reader i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month i usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word of mouth advice but that 's never been enough for me reading a book is an investment to me and i want to make sure my time is well spent bookmarks gives me the confidence that i'm choosing the books i truly want to read i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes \( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer yukio mishima which also shows that bookmarks looks globally not only regionally for classic authors \)	3
1	this magazine is fun and upbeat the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying there are many many recipes one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week a great magazine well worth the money	3
1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare in just 30 minutes no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together just open the book to any page and you 're set and ready to go or should i say cook !	3
1	i have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine the interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community not just a crazy cat person i like the extensive breeder listing in the back whether or not i ever will get a pure bred cat	3
1	this is a great magazine for cat lovers even if you do n't have a cat it talks about care tips as well as stories about other cats	3
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time just from what i 've observed anyway i like the layouts they have good ideas great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking	3
1	i have not yet received my issue of creating keepsakes i have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts	3
1	i am still a college students with no children i got this magazine because i absolutly love children a while back one of the readers suggested taking peices you think will be important and putting them in a scrapbook based on the age of your unborn baby i love this idea and this magazine is the perfect one to do this with	3
1	i really look forward to receiving this every month i am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects organization and meals really fun	3
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice	3
1	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine i think it 's totally hot i really like the fiction and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little mean for my taste they look so challengingly at you instead of invitingly but then again a lot of guys in porn look this way to me this is normal for porn i guess very few if any of them are over beefed \( too muscular \) and some of them are n't muscular at all which means nice variety the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at lots of first times nothing really bizarre or violent overall a cool magazine	3
1	for those of us still a little shy this mag is an awesome substitute it 's like a shopping catalog	3
1	if you like young taut masculine flesh displayed at its most inviting you 'll love this magazine supple nubile youths \( over 18 of course \) parade their wares front and back and look longingly into the camera consistently fine photography makes this magazine first choice for those with a taste for the younger gents	3
1	this is by far the best photo magazine i have seen in my 40 years of being a photographer \( and i subscribe to half a dozen \) the reproduction is superb and it offers a variety of genres without getting into the freaky stuff like aperture sometimes does i have saved every issue i have received as if a book	3
1	this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them i was impressed the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i 've seen the image quality the paper all top notch this is a fine arts magazine and does n't \( at least from what i saw \) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art rather it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i 've read i intend on subscribing	3
1	i love this magazine great travel ideas and fun to read even if you never make the trip ! a recent issue on the yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting we visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise this magazine and tourist in the yucatan \( thriller adventure \) really made my vacation special	3
1	if you like cars then car and driver is the magazine for you the writers are the best and the articles are informitive	3
1	car and driver is the multi purpose auto magazine it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track \( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography \)	3
1	alrightly folks it does n't get any better than this this magazine blends humor with serious reviewing they will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite like me ! anyhow i 've read this magazine for a while and i 've never been disappointed the ask the 800 lbs gorilla section is a riot the bottomline gamer this is an unbiased not corporatly owned \( like opm and xbox magazine \) and a pleasing magazine to read anyone hooked on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a psm and get a subscription	3
1	this is definately a must buy for every ps2 fan great reviews on popular current games giving strong points and weak points for each reviewed game previews on popular upcoming games and some very helpful tips for your more popular games note the word popular as this magazine will not cover every single game out there comical captions here and there also make it a pleasure to read throw in the annual swimsuit issue which the previous reviewer mentioned opinion pages and fan art and there should be nothing stopping a serious ps2 gamer from subscribing to this magazine	3
1	this magazine is the best one out there if your a hardcore ps2 gamer get this for a year or two ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue they give you reviews that are 97 9 of the time helpful you know the 're serious 'cause they write down entire levels ! plus they got swimsuit issues ! a must for the gamer xesx	3
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	3
1	i am a loyal long time fan of empire magazine and have collected almost every issue from no 1 being a british mag it differentiates itself from others like premiere and entertainment weekly by it 's frank dissection of all movies and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion i will always read empire and if you like movies you should too	3
1	this is by far the best design magazine anywhere the price might be daunting but beyond being on the bleeding edge content wise issues are typically loaded with custom papers finishes a fold out poster postcards and other generally inspiring material if you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range \( every month \) this is it not for 8 ways to better drop shadows types this is the real deal	3
1	fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles \( preppy sporty punk etc \) make up tips stories about girls experiences with abuse guy trouble etc	3

1	this science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person articles are good not overly technical in depth at times it gets in its doldrums of articles but generally it holds it own you do n't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same but it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot it does at times takes some thought of getting used to their 'special topic issues' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic well received for the high schooler either as the magazine or the website at least the layperson can be science informed the title of the magazine says it all	3

1	as a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school i would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat not only does this magazine site books that may help designers but it also gives advice on what works the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing i come from an entire family of designers illustrators and art directors all whom love communication arts but that one is far too boring for me how is more exciting and for only 30 it is at a very reasonable price	3
1	i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business	3
1	this magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind i have developed some serious guts in fighting for what i am worth due to this publication when you are a new designer you get taken advantage of frequently college did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market and this magazine not only keeps you up to date with the latest in the design realm but also serves as a gutsy motivational read as well this is a must have subscription for budding designers what a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest	3
1	i got american girl when i was nine and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it i think you can be intreseted in teen people type magazines but still love american girl it has lots of crafts and my favorite part the lunch box section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school it is a short magazine but they make up for it by having the jumbo summer issue i think its definitaly worth the money	3

1	i frequently read 'new criterion' articles on the 'arts and letters daily' website they are usually of high quality and well worth reading hilton kramer and roger kimball the editorial writers mark steyn the drama critic \( and also one of the best writers on world affairs around \) jay nordlinger \( the music critic \) are among the regulars in a solid and respectable cast of writers the great joseph epstein also writes here the articles in 'the new criterion' give the sense that there is a living 'high culture' and this in spite of the often critical stance to many modern cultural developments	3
1	road and track is like the tortise and the hare it does n't move with lighting speed from trend to trend as some other publications but its slow and methodical evolution yeilds a contemporary classic it 's format and photography are faultless the editorials are engaging particularly peter egan 's and no one can match the prowess of technical editor dennis semantis quite possibly the best automotive magazine in the industry	3
1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit it is only as good as the tools you use this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material	3
1	sometimes the national enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject for example it broke the story about o j 's shoes i guess you have to pick and choose your articles some of the articles i admit are useless however other articles are interesting and some you ca n't find anyplace else	3
1	ok the advertisements are a bit much but the magazine is great my son has subscriptions to cricket and kids discover too he has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years and this one stands out to me because unprompted he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing this magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all the magazine format is easy to read yet rich in content	3
1	a great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on i have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by editor jason sizemore 's growing tome to the darker side of sci fi with solid interviews and strong fiction by established pros like william f nolan ben bova tom piccirilli neil gaiman and brian keene and talented newcomers like bryn sparks jenifer pelland and eugie foster you ca n't miss with this one	3

1	i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	3

1	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine i think it 's totally hot i really like the fiction and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little mean for my taste they look so challengingly at you instead of invitingly but then again a lot of guys in porn look this way to me this is normal for porn i guess very few if any of them are over beefed \( too muscular \) and some of them are n't muscular at all which means nice variety the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at lots of first times nothing really bizarre or violent overall a cool magazine	3

1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nasttraveler and i'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire this magazine has articles about places not about \( as one other reviewer wrote \) articles about martinis fashion etc it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one	3

1	i have subscribed for years to this in my opinion the hand 's down best most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available practical solidly researched non preachy and impeccably edited it provides even handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog 's happiness well being and ability to be a good companion the annual dog food ratings alone are worth the subscription price every constituency should be as well served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one	3
1	i received my first magazine it is n't glossy or flashy but is full of in depth info which is exactly what i wanted not very thick for the money but i'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content	3
1	i 've received the whole dog journal for the past year i have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements it 's pure holistic news information health nutrition training food testing and anything else pertaining to dogs ! i would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned one thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing it 's not always easy to get information that is up to date helpful and necessary with the whole dog journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge	3

1	car and driver is the multi purpose auto magazine it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track \( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography \)	3
1	gq a k a gentlemen 's quarterly is a men 's magazine like cosmopolitan is to women gq has a broad range of contents in it 's magazine from in depth articles from movie and rock stars fashion food and drink technology movies music etc the magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages all in all gq is a great men 's magazine with plenty of fashion news tips and also delves in other men 's interests as stated above	3

1	the wine spectator is the ultimate guide to wine as a magazine it gives trusted up to date information on wine and related issues i look forward to each issue and always find something interesting i would definitely recommend this periodical to all wine lovers	3
1	there 's certainly a lot to hate about wine spectator and for that matter wine advocate many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines and usually lay the blame entirely at robert parker 's doorstep for making the 100 point rating system an industry standard wine spectator 's scores have gotten better with time as have their articles they 've shied away from california glitz and have looked more into food also the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine i think they 've done well	3
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	3
1	i got a free subscription to this newspaper and i am thoroughly enjoying it the olympics coverage was wonderful along with the color pics i like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the life section i love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality tv news synopsis i used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation now i am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life	3

1	i am a big fan of this magazine but even more so of the free cd when it is good it is very good so i finally subscribed despite the stiff price two issues came i was happy then a third without the cd and then no more after many calls and complaints amazon finally secured a partial refund not exactly what i wanted here 's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out maybe an opaque wrapper	3
1	this is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market you can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases and it 's nice that the crew of empire does n't take themselves too seriously the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are unfortunately it 's rather expensive here in denmark but it 's worth the price	3
1	forget about shop etc lucky is the best shopping mag by far i got alot of coupons for full size products an samples inside of lucky magazine i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion makeup hair produts house wares etc	3

1	the recipes are great and so is the travel advice for those seeking a good meal while traveling i get great ideas for presentation and entertaining at home if you enjoy fine dining or just reading about it then this magazine is worth a subscription and would make a nice holiday gift that will keep giving year roun	3
1	most of this magazines travel articles and ads are not targeted at someone like me i'm a homemaker with a limited budget i do n't travel much or am in the market for the fancy things they advertise however i just renewed my subscription becuase when i have tried the recipes in the magazine they were really wonderful i 've added every recipe i 've tried from gourmet to my 'keeper' recipe binder i admit the dishes were harder to make but the results were definitely worth the trouble	3
1	fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles \( preppy sporty punk etc \) make up tips stories about girls experiences with abuse guy trouble etc	3
1	relevant magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith many of the reviews are of secular artists the spiritual content or message \( or lack thereof \) of the music they sing films they make and books they write they also review christian artists many who are on the fringe this is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things if you just want a 'youth oriented' christian magazine with bible studies and how to 's you 'll probably be disapointed	3
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	i just received my first order and i love it ! this magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques current trends period styles and so much more it has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles i think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits	3
1	as a potential interior designer i find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest i have a subscription and i find that studying the designers the styles and the themes i have learned so much about the work of a designer i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors	3
1	i love house beautiful ! it gives so many wonderful ideas this is a collection of ecclectic styles patterns and methods that will suit anyone 's taste and these ideas are n't hard to follow with the smallest effort anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine	3
1	paula 's magazine is wonderful unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland they are all from paula 's cookbooks new recipes or from her friends none are bland they are pure paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for i have been fortunate enough to meet paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t v show paula 's party this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents !	3
1	i like paula deen 's cooking and find that i prefer to order my magazines through amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire so i can choose to renew instead of flooding me with 6 months' worth of letters in the mail saying renew now or else you 'll miss an issue invariably i never missed an issue but i certainly overpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when i may not have wanted to	3
1	great magazine but do n't subscribe here you can do it online at her website or tear out the order form in a magazine and it will cost 50 less	3
1	this magazine is great ! ! ! the weddings magazine is for the bride who wants great ideas and advice for a stylish and elegant wedding the magazine includes great articles for wedding tips sanity savers and after the wedding advice weddings does contain advertisements for attire but that is not their only service this magazine also includes wonderful real wedding stories that are inspiring and give great ideas for your own wedding i highly recommend this magazine for a more mature bride or for a bride who already has picked out her dress but still wants great wedding ideas	3

1	i have been reading health off and on since i was in high school in the late 1980s and overall i love this magazine ! the articles are usually rather interesting and there is always at least one long article that i find relevant to my life or curiosities however there are times when the topics articles border on resembling cosmo and glamour rather than really being related to health overall i recommend health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health related issues but do n't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article	3
1	this is a pretty good magazine the niche is that it goes out every week and thus it is the most current business news magazine out there \( if you compare it to fortune forbes \) i always find 3 4 interesting articles there but do n't expect to read cover to cover	3
1	i have subscribed to business week for two years now i suggest that people accusing them of having a liberal agenda reread their past issues bush was receiving criticism for not being republican enough ! his deficit spending is the most clear example other fiscal conservatives such as george will have criticized the president does that mean they are following a liberal agenda \? i think not	3
1	this was for my friend in jail i believe he said that he 's enjoying i	3

1	i remember when this magazine was the lone conservative voice on the newstands i too have memories of many long latinate sentences which mr buckley provided and i had to try and figure out it is not that i always agreed much less understood him but i did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer who had a real concern for public life in america and his own ideas of how to make it better i also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion journal which explored many aspects of american reality the magazine today seems to me still to be of high quality though mr buckley is no longer at the helm	3
1	the magazine is being delivered as per the agreement some people especially the avowed liberals would not want this magazine as this presents a strong conservative viewpoint	3
1	this is a great foodie magazine we think the writing is what makes it great it is always interesting has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff very enjoyable	3
1	what a beautiful magazine \( full color pictures on glossy paper \) and what interesting stories behind each food the recipes are sometimes doable although most of the time i just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each a must have makes the living room look very sophisticated	3
1	i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best bar none the houses featured are absolutely dreamy the photography is gorgeous and while the magazine does n't offer how to decorating ideas there is so much inspiration i find it to be intelligently written which is rare in a decorating magazine the articles on antiques are particularly informative this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful classic design whether or not you live in the south	3

1	too many christians are ignorant of our rich past we know a lot about the 1st century and the current times but everything in between is somewhat blank christian history magazine is more than informative it inspires challenges and even admonishes in its unique way i look forward to each issue i doubt i will ever let this expire	3
1	i know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but i do appreciate the information that i 've gained from store bought maximum pc magazines i do n't build computers but when i do order one it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer yes you can find much information on line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox however is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it \) a very good magazine but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language thus the 4 rather than five stars	3
1	i read the nation for its poetry katha pollitt and takes on the news it 's a left wing magazine i do n't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect objectivity humans have opinions and viewpoints even time magazine and the national review have viewpoints	3
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market very realistic with budgets too it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable \( on any budget \) i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful	3
1	instyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible the features are very informative and fun i enjoy the man of style feature and the entertaining guide best ! for more on mags visit my blog at magazinediva typepad com	3
1	in my humble opinion this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice even the advertisements are hip and informative in terms of fashion and style of all the style magazines out there today this is far and away the best of the best	3
1	i love instyle i can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of instyle it is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic timeless fashion it shows what is hot how to put outfits together who wears what and it does n't try to dabble in other areas it sticks to fashion and i like that that is why i subscribe to it and probably always will the best out there much better than elle and likely even better than vogue i love it	3
1	this magazine transports you to a different world every issue is a wish book with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month or crafts to do over your next long weekend or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room well in my life years go by and i dream on but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped negative angry thoughts i will never laugh at crafty people again i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside but the dreams are sweet the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating but then you have gardening cooking baking furniture decorating beading anything do it yourself martha is truly a wonder woman worth every cent	3
1	someone posted below that they do n't receive all their issues i have never failed to receive an issue i suspect someone is making off with this person 's copies this is an elegant magazine worthy of martha if they cover a topic you will know all there is to know about that topic the recipes are little gems and i like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved it 's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world i do miss martha 's column of reminiscences and wish that was back in the magazine	3
1	the american spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual not only are the articles witty and well researched they also provide well articulated arguments to the most pressing \( if sometimes slighlty out of date \) controversies of the times well worth the subscription price or even the cover price	3
1	love this magazine ! just wish it came out more often great for more than those with farms or homesteads articles on gardening building projects animals buy it	3
1	this magazine is absolutely wonderful after receiving my first copy i went to their website and backordered about 10 copies excellent reading and information regarding ideas on what people are doing to successfully make money off of your land alpacas flower growing chickens small and larger animal livestock etc ! lots of neat advertisements too on things you just didnt know existed i will never be without this magazine it is inspirational	3
1	most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite this is the only weekly newsmag i can stand to read and i love to read it us news is a grab bag of topics international is excellent \( vs other us sources of news \) finance business is excellent science is a grab bag books arts is quite good and the periodic special reports are great cheeky and clear a delight to read bring your skepticism though because the reporters columnists are not shy about taking a position and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion	3
1	too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists \( such as those that work for fox news \) the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america 's it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world from politics to economics to science to the arts best of all the articles \( except for the special report \) are concise allowing for an easy read	3
1	still talking about the 'asian thing' \? get a grip ! ! this is the best magazine on the market period it speaks to you in an honest matter and the info is top rated there just is no better men 's magazine without a nude centerfold	3
1	there was a time when i read a lot of magazines i found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff i was introduced to fast company in 1997 and have been a subsriber for most if not all of the last 8 years every issue has relevant topics on the current state of business it has stayed with a formula that has worked that business in constantly changing and to reflect back on the past when something has changed that they once wrote on i heartily recommend this must read to anyone who wants to make a difference in the business world	3
1	to the defunct and much missed armchair detective magazine comparisons aside strand is the best of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines newsletters covering the mystery genre very enjoyable ! ! and do n't sell some of them short either ! john rowin1ea	3
1	my wife brought a copy of strand home yesterday the editorial and production quality look excellent the personality interview scholarly article and the short stories are very good i plan to subscribe	3
1	i do n't know what planet that guy is from who is saying below that he had to wait a long time if he bought a pair of glasses he would notice that you have to wait for 12 16 weeks for every magazine you order from amazon i had no problem with that i think the strand is a unique magazine with fiction by such great writers as sir john mortimer edward marston and great interview with actor michael york they also have fine articles one such article was about hercule poirot agatha christie they are doing a great job	3
1	detailed articles and interesting columns balanced and not afraid to be critical where appropriate	3

1	woman 's day has the feel of a community with its intensely personal warmth from parenting advice health cooking crafts and homemaking and more it bonds its target audience together whether you 're a single mom happily married or even single i enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult highly recommend	3
1	woman 's day is a good resource for women it covers a variety of topics including health beauty diet exercise relationships children there are tips for getting organized recipes crafts and decorating tips also there 's a tip a day calendar as well as a day to day meal planner it relies heavily on reader 's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles each issue tells you how to join the woman 's day readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize and even if you do n't want to join the reader 's panel there are plenty of other prizes given away by woman 's day woman 's day is well worth subscribing to !	3
1	bought this as a girft for my mother and she loves reading them must be really good	3
1	no doubt wired is one of the best tech magazines in print but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november i had to call and cancel my subscription i now subscribe directly	3
1	the first copy of the magazine my wife received was a two month old copy of the magazine when the current magazine issue was on the newstand the second issue came on time but the third issue has yet to arrive as the current issue has been sitting on the magazine shelf for weeks the distribution of this very good product is very inconsistent maybe i can cancel my subscription and take a money lost and get this superior magazine from the magazine store	3
1	i received my subscription in a timely manner and received backdated issues also i am very happy with the magazine	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3

1	this magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little short articles on sexual improvement books health and beaty products if any other these interest you i would highly recommend this mazagine	3
1	this is the intelligent fashion magazine that does n't treat fashion lovers like idiots ! great in depth articles on screenplays celebs charities politics and of course fashion duh !	3
1	i have read vanity fair for the past twenty years the articles are timely and in depth there are articles on politicians bankers ceos as well as the hollywood types this is the magazine for those who want to be in the know also the photographs are fantastic if you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress actor of the hour this is not the magazine for you	3
1	i have been reading this magazine and love it perfect for those of us who decorate in the shabby cottage romantic or new cottage style there has recently been a change in editors or something like that and i see quite a difference in the magazine lately not too happy about it it used to have great decorating ideas for the average person now their showing us castles etc and pages of retailers with yarn shops not to mention all the gardens pages wasted as far as i am concerned a little was fine but pages and pages i do n't know if i will continue to buy probably give it another month or 2 to see worth checking out to see if it is for you	3

1	my husband and i love getting our monthly subscription we read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered we often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we 've read about variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together if you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag check out intense games dvd it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality really	3
1	this magazine is pretty i am not that interested in long articles so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped	3
1	i 've had subscriptions to just about every woman 's magazine there is over the past 8 years but the only one i always renew is glamour it 's less how to catch a man oriented than cosmo less pseudo hipster than jane and less serious than marie claire while it 's certainly no ms magazine it has a lot of women positive messages every issue articles that are n't as sensationalistic and fear mongering than most found in women 's magazines and lots of fashion and beauty tips i feel that glamour strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness for those of you who like a side of third wave feminism with your fashion i highly recommend it	3
1	outstanding comparitive review of new vehicles for 2006 combined with consumers report evaluations no reason to go into dealership with many questions december 2005 issue a must have for serious lookers contemplating purchase	3
1	kiplinger 's personal finance magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest common denominator approach of money magazine and the head in the clouds attitude at worth magazine kiplinger 's has a nicely balanced style and tone it never preaches and i almost always find a tip suggestion or tax saving idea that pays for my year 's subscription in every single issue if that 's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine then kiplinger 's personal finance magazine deserves a five star rating good stuff and a good value	3
1	this is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers from front cover to back it 's full of the information you need to know about new books favorite authors and what 's going on in the mystery business	3

1	this is the third time i have purchased handyman magazine for family members as gifts this time i misunderstood how to gift the item unfortunately i did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a christmas gift after calling the only recourse i was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes \( because it is coming to me instead of my son in atlanta \) call and cancel the order and reorder unfortunately doing this it will not reach my son in time for christmas i would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me but send as a gift	3
1	this is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement beyond the great ideas they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures i have learned how to do a great number of things i used to hire others to do because i thought i did n't have the skills they make most projects around the house seem accessible but not by oversimplifying the process some may argue that they give too much detail but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced the only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed !	3
1	this magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of best lists to suit every taste the selections page starts with a collection of staff favorites highlighted with a one \( do n't bother \) to five \( rarely given a timeless classic \) star rating system there 's a digest of 27 best books 2005 lists in a recent issue a page on the whitbread awards a selection of current and upcoming books reader recommendations new in paperback a year in books \( e g 1981 \) etc coupled with very little advertising it 's great !	3

1	i go to a gym where people share their magazines and came across this gem while it focuses on value vacation packages the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world the magazine also offers an up to date web page describing even more places and bargains it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots that alone is worth the reasonable cost	3
1	budget travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland i also like some not all of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written however at the same time it does need better organization as compared with \( horrors \) conde nast i am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible i cant access it ! !	3
1	what i like about this magazine is that it does not focus on mainstream attractions and destinations it tries to go off the beaten path and provides many suggestions of places to visit restaurants to eat at and even specific places to shop not only that on every issue they have a list of awesome travel tips provided by travelers in addition they list great travel specials and the corresponding websites i 've been a subscriber for approximately 6 months and i have to say that i enjoy this magazine	3

1	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine the primary difference is the longer well written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail if you do n't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy	3
1	i only got the first issue but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers \( hence the name \) i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction they might do well to keep the two separate especially the contests and events it 's an attractive format and very upscale high quality literature reviews and advice the stories are well written and enjoyable although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers	3
1	this magazine is a must have for professional poets	3

1	this magazine does hold my kids' interest and i feel it was worth the money for one year the articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects however i probably wo n't renew because i feel the regular national geographic magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run i guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway so the issues and photos of national geographic magazine are not too adult or inappropriate	3
1	ok the advertisements are a bit much but the magazine is great my son has subscriptions to cricket and kids discover too he has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years and this one stands out to me because unprompted he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing this magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all the magazine format is easy to read yet rich in content	3
1	the london review of books is without a doubt the best literary journal in the world at the same time erudite entertaining and informative each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob highly recommended	3
1	the london review of books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature the arts culture history politics philosophy published in the world today it now beats the ny review of books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the tls back in the dust if you want to get your bearings in the world of culture and politics this is must reading denis jonneswashington d c kitakyushu japan	3
1	i have more animals than i know i love best my gang of dogs and this mag has it all products reviews vet info wonderful storie	3
1	a great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on i have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by editor jason sizemore 's growing tome to the darker side of sci fi with solid interviews and strong fiction by established pros like william f nolan ben bova tom piccirilli neil gaiman and brian keene and talented newcomers like bryn sparks jenifer pelland and eugie foster you ca n't miss with this one	3

1	under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i'm a little too close minded to care about other genres i do n't care much about fans of rock pop what the kids are calling indie alternative punk post punk folk ! ! ! ! take a gander at this and the covers are slick and durable they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table	3
1	this is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull this mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music i recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music	3
1	my students love getting a chance to read on current topics they are interested in	3
1	my son is a sports junkie at 7 years old he gets really excited everytime the issue shows up in the mail it is an easy read for him and he loves the posters and pictures included in each issue if you have a budding sports enthusist i would definetly recommend this magazine besides the more reading your child does the better it is for them no matter the reading medium	3
1	my son looks forward to his ranger rick magazine i am glad that we decided to go with ranger rick instead of the 4 6 year old magazine version our 4 year old loves the pictures and he loves the information	3
1	our ranger rick issues are used first as reading material then discussion material then project material \( cut outs etc \) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much tear out posters line my son 's walls there is no objectionable material in the magazine just wholesome fun reading no political agenda is discernable from it which is refreshing as soon as it comes in the mail my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through the knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge	3
1	we subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well we all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail i enjoy flipping through it myself you 're never to old to learn fun facts about nature ! ! a perfect gift	3
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	3
1	this paper offers a wonderful broad perspective and great national coverage does n't take too long but always has plenty to read every american should read this paper and every adult should check out the new sex now dvd	3
1	the weekly standard clearly has a conservatinve bent however it is not the sort that screams this is the only way to think about this topic it is thoughtful commentary delivered with well crafted writing i come away from reading an issue thinking that i have been well informed	3
1	after reading a few of the other reviews i am again baffled by the left liberal take on things this is a conservative magazine ! ! liberals open at your own risk ! you just might encounter a differing view point than you own ! goodness the articles are informative indepth humorous and thoughtful it 's a good read	3
1	no ads large print beautiful illustrations interesting age appropriate stories every magazine by this publisher \( cricket etc \) are all quality magazines that are child centered my daughter is five i think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads' it cover to cover she also enjoys looking at the pictures as well this is worth every penny	3
1	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug these are just the best children 's publications we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends	3
1	if you really love sports there is no finer magazine than si the breadth and depth of the coverage is unequalled by any other mag the pics are the best on earth the writing is tops sign me up for another 24 months	3
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue however as other reviews have indicated the articles are quite lacking they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting so you get vogue for the pictures if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine if you want something to read get something else	3
1	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality it 's an icon all over the world the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi billion dollar industry	3
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3
1	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! !	3
1	fangoria has always been the first rate magazine for horror movie freaks nothing else comes close if you 're in love with horror movies look no further this mag has been out for over twenty years	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	i find it to be the least biased among pc computer magazines unlike most of its competitors computer reviews are typically supported by objective benchmarks this magazine does not generally cover pc components such as cases fans and motherboards but it is immensely useful for their reviews of brand peripherals \( eg lcd printers graphics cards \) and computers	3
1	ladies home journal has several features that readers will like one of the most popular is can this marriage be saved featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor 's advise other columns include how they met animal affairs and raising a family each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through habitat a nice feature is a column presenting a man 's perspective called heart of a husband there are also articles on beauty health travel and parenting there are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews i highly recommend subscribing to ladies home journal you wo n't be disappointed !	3
1	a great magazine for digital camera users from beginner to expert has great tips and information	3
1	this magazine covers every aspect of horror suspense culture such as comics books music and of course movies the writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject and do n't just dwell on blood and gore \( but have no fear there is plenty of that \) whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork too give this one a try i 'll bet you 'll love it as much as i do	3
1	entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles i consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information i receive for about a buck there are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with but that seems to be the case with most media i do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business it is a good complement however	3
1	though the magazine does have the mlm and quot you to can get rich quot articles it has validity you can do anything if you find the right thing something your passionate about i 've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation but i can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs is n't that the main goal here \? you have to find it no one is going to hand it to you do the research and the work and ask for mentoring follow up on the leads and ideas they give you i truly enjoy this magazine carpe diem	3
1	great magazine my favorite ! ! ! ! if you dont like the price here go to uncuts home site and subscribe at about 7 per issue	3

1	this is one of the best literary journals i have seen in years ! the content is broad and interesting \( a good mix of fiction and poetry \) and it seemed like i had a new surprise in store for me every time i turned the page	3
1	there are many reasons to love this great magazine and a few reasons not to one of the reasons not to is there many ads but if you want to read what great writers write you have to make reading the new yorker on your top 10 list	3
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism fiction reviews and of course cartoons all written by some of the best writers in the land it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers but one word of caution if you 're the type of person that whines liberal bias at anything that you slightly disagree with then this is not the magazine for you	3
1	i like this magazine and i subscribe to it \( along with cooking for two and cook 's country \) but i do n't think it 's perfect i like when the magazine offers a several page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins so i can make whatever flavor i choose and know it will turn out well but the magazine does contain ads despite what one reviewer claimed	3
1	this is the one only cooking food magazine to buy not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine 's test kitchens it also illustrates step by step instruction rates cooking tools gadgets educates the reader on seasonal ingredients	3
1	each issue piles on the terror do n't read this late at night ! what i truly enjoy is the variety of stories it 's not just for horror fans folks some of these tales are suspenseful and others just leave you sitting there thinking what the f k \? that did not just happen ! i have a lifetime subscription so i guess that means i'm takin' it to the grave and they 'll still deliver ! ! !	3

1	this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that pictureimportant they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed \( if it is a person \) this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy	3
1	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3

1	this is an excellent magazine about american history the magazine provides a wide range of stories on a bi monthly basis it does n't repeat the same stories that most people know but it tries to tell instances that are not as well known in some cases it is little known stories about significant events and other times they have stories about little known pieces of american history i only wish the magazine had a monthly publication	3
1	the magazine was exactly what i wanted and super cheap through amazon com i am happy with my purchase	3
1	this is perhaps my favorite photography magazine the printing is fantastic as is the subject matter i really like the fact there are no ads in it at all so many photography mags are just an extended catalog for b h or adorama that this is a breath of fresh air the photography itself is second to none always something interesting and fresh	3
1	there 's a lot to like about lenswork the selection of images the quality of the printing bill jay 's end notes but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment brooks jensen \( the editor publisher \) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it all that matters is the image and after you 've finished looking at the images you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue too highly recommended	3
1	this magazine is ill ! i learn about all the new albums coming out read the review and if they say they are good i go out and buy 'em the reviews are also accurate giving the appropiate number of stars i also love the sections on the new artists on the verge the cover stories never seem to dis please me always givin' me plent of info the mini articles are cool too from stuff like warren 's sapp 's all star football team to all about how mike jones was discovered one last thing i love about the magazine they are never thin issues and you know what that means ! ! !	3

1	this is the best business and money magazine out there they cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you did n't think of	3
1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3
1	yes the magazine is great but up to 1 3 of the pages are ads they will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters and occasionally you get a big stinky aol disk in with your issue kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios welcome to the mainstream media	3
1	i highly recommend highlights for children it 's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way watch your child 's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles hidden pictures games and fun and entertaining stories cynthia marie rizzo author of julie and the unicorn	3
1	i have been subscribing to alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine for many years i find it an excellent periodical the genres range from humor cosies hard boiled detectives to locked room puzzles with an added dessert of a quot mystery classic quot at the end of every issue some dating from the 19th century i especially enjoy the absence of gore the stories are just the right length to satisfy your quot mystery craving quot before bedtime another kudo the ahmm is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors	3
1	if you have any interest in design i recommend getting this mag it has the latest trends in design as well as new products and designers	3

1	my impression of mainstream american food magazine is that they focus on mostly hearty meals and thick dense and rich desserts which is not what ij 'd like to include in my diet delicious magazine is different it has a lot of refreshing and light dishes it is more expensive then the other magazines probably because it 's being imported and printed in australia \( instead of printed in china like other books nowadays \) you should try to see if your local bookseller carries it because the cover price is only us 8 99 per issue month when i am writing this review amazon is selling it for us 126 for 11 issues you do the math	3

1	this magazine really gives you good info on piloting today	3
1	at least as far as the magazine itself is concerned but cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage email and a ton of other things all in online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis however i just read two hardcopy issues when i was in vegas and i liked the features pro coverage interviews and book reviews should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game	3

1	just got this in the mail if i allow si to charge my credit card now for a subscription that is n't due to renew until 12 24 2007 they will send me 60 issues for 39 00 or 65 per issue i have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time so there is a very slight savings somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my for an extra 9 months or so \( recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2 that interest is worth about 50 cents so i guess it pushes the per issue rate up to 66 \)	3
1	consistently the best sports writing in a periodical format i even find myself absorbed in articles in sports i know little about or have n't followed because the writing is so good photography is great too	3
1	the magazine started being delivered earlier than promised and it 's a much better price than you 'll get from si directly	3

1	from fitting pants to making origami pants there is always something for the sewer to learn and enjoy threads used to have good knitting articles but decided to abandon the subject to concentrate on sewing if you are a fashion sewer this is a must have	3
1	i have been a subscriber to threads since it 's inaugural issue and have saved every one the publishers writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy originality and inspiration while the magazine has evolved over the years and away from accessory crafts such as knitting it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly in more easy to understand depth than any other publication of it 's type the pictures and diagrams are professional and clear the instructions well written even the advertising is worth perusing top caliber all around	3

1	less traditional more imaginative worth the extra	3
1	bell'italia is an italian language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described the photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving moreover in the more famous cities like venice and florence the places presented are often those that do not get much notice in addition the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting i have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue	3

1	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club \( where he works out \) if you overlook that aspect the mag is great the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate well worth it it also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store	3

1	okay yeah it 's no vogue or cosmo but glamour is a lot more accessible to the everyperson than the other two not all of us have glamourous pagegirl jobs that \( miraculously \) pay six figures seriously secretaries in prada \? as if ! so glamour is a little more realistic and a little more fun and a lot less expensive it 's a fun cheap guilty pleasure	3
1	this magazine is pretty i am not that interested in long articles so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped	3
1	i like this one better than cosmo great info on beauty and the like	3
1	i have been subscribing to young rider for 4 years now my grand daughter has loved this magazine from the begining she saves all the pictures posters she even takes the magazine to horse shows to be autographed by stars she reads about our family has standardbreds so she has always been around horses and she has developed a love and understanding and a talent in the show ring this magazine has contributed to her growth	3
1	i love evo and buy it every month so why do n't i get a subscription \? because it still costs less to buy it at barnes and noble than to get a 12 month subscription ! this must be the only magazine that can claim a cheaper in store price what 's up with that	3
1	this is my favourite car mag out there right now it exceeds car by miles in terms of writing quality i only have to say one thing it 's cheaper to buy this at a local mega bookstore like boarders than to buy this online it costs 9 99 issue so a year would cost 120 plus tax i thought getting a subscription should save you money not make you pay more ! !	3
1	i love this magazine ! i love how the main message is be yourself ! it has no advertizments and it does n't say you have to be beautiful to be happy i'm really tom boy and alot of other magazines make you feel like normal girls are obsessed with iming fashion makeup and boys ! i hate those magazines ! read a total sucker ! ! ! ! another review of this magazine it says that normal teenage girls have crushes and hate to be out of style ! am i like that \? no way ! this magazine is just right it has probably 1 true artical about that stuff but it 's not really flirty or something ! get this magazine !	3
1	i think this magazine is really good it gives you all the latest gossip on the best stars it even answers your questions about some of the tabloids like are jessica nick really over \? i think it 's pretty wholesome too the make up tips are great it 's the average teen girl 's fave mag	3
1	this magizine has the latest star scoop and the coolest stories sentin by reader	3
1	good magazine for the married over 50 group which represents 90 5 of the retired travelers	3
1	starting as a quartely publication black book has vaulted to bi monthly releases and the highest level a magazine can aspire to reach the publishers have their finger on a pulse that pumps literary fashion music entertainment and art style onto eye catching pages i have n't missed an issue and never will	3
1	this magazine is great ! for sport specific magazines this is probably one of the best that i have seen yes the photos are large and detailed but the kicker is the writing incredible content without being wordy variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport just very impressive	3
1	this is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design advertising illustration or photograhy it digs deep into industry trends features portfolios of upcoming industry stars and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously while the issues are great their regional design annual is the must buy issue every year it really lets you know who the cream of the crop are just flipping through it will make you better at what you do \( and you 'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like quot cream of the crop quot \)	3
1	my 4 year old according to my wife ca n't put this one down ever since the stories started coming it has been non stop reading this is the type of books that i want for my children	3
1	if you live in the country and have a hobby type farm this magazine is bulging with valuable information i was surprised to find no color pages at first but the magazine is recycleable paper printed with soy ink very cool out of all the country type magazines i 've read this one is the best	3
1	tsn is an excellent sports magazine for the general sports fan it covers nearly all the sports in and out of season including nascar autoracing a sports fan will find something of interest in every issue i was able to find a free subscription which makes it ever better ! i would recommend it to any sportsfan who wants to read about his favorite teams or sport	3
1	sports car international never loses focus on its mission providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car i do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs from the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard top mx 5 it just sticks to real sports cars seems simple right \? yet no one else gets it quite as right	3
1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive the articles are interesting and well written the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders if you 're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must have magazine	3
1	the magazine is made exclusively for hardcore bodybuilders if you 're into fitness this magazine ai n't for you however if you 're into bodybuilding hardcore then this is the magazine for you it is jam packed with muscle upon muscle of some of the most hardcore bodybuilders in the business	3
1	if you are interested in off the grid living or any form of alternative energy home power magazine is a must read	3
1	this is the best artist 's magazine being published i have had subscriptions to them all at one time or another i have been a subscriber for at least ten years now it 's the only magazine that i can actually use in a class on how to my students learn from the articles and so do i ! k j murra	3
0	my boss asked me to get this so that he check out the latin portion of it what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is latin american spanish the interface was underwhelming i needed to guess at what did what because the controls are mostly icons what 's worse there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program apparently though the manufacturer did throw in an extra not listed on the back if you are learning the differences between us and uk english its there ! i gave this one star only because i could n't give it no stars	4
0	i found this title messing around adding things to my wish list i only read the blurb on amazon enough to see haitian creaole listed as one of the languages today updating my wish list i took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more ! how unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake i almost made buying this in hopes of it having haitian creole ! very disappointing ! ! ! ! the makers should be ashamed	4
0	they have the hebrew backwards ! ! you are supposed to read hebrew right to left the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right i find it extremely confusing i know how to read hebrew and i wanted to learn how to speak it what a poor effort !	4
0	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole and i too could n't find it there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole except the jewel case which insists it 's there i'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out i consider this a very bad start	4
0	imagine that you know so little about a computer that you would n't even be here reading this review these discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded dial yellow wall phone if you are a recent \( one hour ago \) immigrant from a sixth world country and you need to forward the burger king christmas song well then you 're already ahead of these learning cds \( my apologies to grandmothers with corded dial yellow wall phones \) \( actually i kinda wish i had one ! \) regards older but no smarter	4
0	when i first installed the program i was able to access the images but since that first time i have n't my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software i have since then uninstalled it i did not think this product was very easy to use	4
0	i installed a perfectly legal upgrade of photoshop cs2 it worked fine for a handful of months and then it quit technical support was of no help i had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine i am so frustrated about this i probably spent 100 hours with the data backup moving data reformatting and reinstalling if i were a small business i would be out of business all because this piece of crap program which i purchased legally decided to quit totally unacceptable	4
0	this is the worst version of adobe illustrator to be released since version 9 opens files that i 've been using for years and then writes scribbled unopenable 'saved' versions crashes ca n't save for mysterious reasons writes version 10 files with text split into pieces such a fine product ! really glad i paid money for it ! ! i downgraded back to irritator 10	4
0	this product could put user customer 's life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off road this is the worst product that i have used in my life	4
0	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought i did not do much research i think the data may be in there but i could not learn how to make it work the interface is horrific unusable do n't do it	4
0	i was expecting a lot more from these two cd 's it teaches you a few items of food basic words like hello please and airplane and even teaches you to ask where are the suitcases but then that is about it i was really hoping for more much more	4
0	this software did n't quite do what i expected i was somewhat disappointed when i discovered that it would n't convert itunes m4p music files to mp3 files to run on a real player	4
0	did not work with my apple computer requested help but did not get results i wanted which was to return idem get credi	4
0	the computer i have now \( about 500 mhz \) is faster than my last one and the earlier version of plus ! worked well with my older model however my current model ca n't process most of the programs available so i just deleted the whole package i intend to get a faster computer in the near future and will use superpack at that time the features look pretty cool but i ca n't give it a favorable rating at this time however when i see how it would work with a faster processor i may re rate my review	4
0	warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot it destroyed my system and i had to format my whole drive read all the reviews from this program carefully i read them but did not believe them	4
0	attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003 bad move none of my access 97 programs work now in fact i i brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions nope the upgrade just did n't work had to purchase a full version to set things right save your money on this product	4
0	why are the newer products getting slower by the version i still love version 5 it does not forever to open up in a web browser update i have been using version 7 now for several months i am glad to say that i am now a lot happier granted it still uses a lot of memory however the new features that it has compared to version 5 makes the upgrade worthwhile however watch out there are several features that adobe took out from the standard version and only has on the pro version	4
0	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4 0 is a downgrade from 3 0 performance is very poor especially the organizer it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera compared to elements recently i 've been getting lots of crashes though everything else on my system is completely stable the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality when it works correctly	4
0	junk ! i am a professional photographer and have used 2 0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier i was wrong this program is a step back i was a refund ! i do n't know who is writing they like this new version but buyer beware ! laur	4
0	crashed the system every time i tried to use it gave me such a headache i tossed it in the trash	4
0	if you use microsoft office \( word excel \) do n't buy it ! links to your previous pdf simply do n't work adobe knows about it but have no viable work around stick with prevous versions	4
0	obviously bogus reviews version 6 was slow as a dog so any improvement will make this more interesting of course rasing the price to 300 and 450 is less interesting what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 \? how bout tossing us all a bone	4
0	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4
0	this product is very nice when it works however i'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me when i attempt to export the image either by saving draging or copying hemera places a transparency over the object making the product worthless i gave it two stars because for the two months it worked it worked well however now it wo n't work at all and as the other reviewer stated support is nearly non existant	4
0	i bought this product after reading the other on line reviews saying how easy it was to use i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy ! it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke ! i would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you 're a professional architect computer genius	4
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4
0	1 you ca n't print on anything over 8 5x14 paper useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale 2 i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3 0 of broderbund 3d home architect it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	4
0	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4
0	this computer system although almost universally accepted can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free such as the fedora project \( a distribution of linux a os which can be changed by anyone for free \) or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 \( 90 \) or less	4
0	the mac os 129 list often cheaper does n't get viruses worms malware etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc with the exception of some games go to a mac store and try it for yourself	4
0	sorry to disappoint the believers but this os is way overpriced for what it does and it will dominate you instead of the converse	4
0	this is microsoft 's most stable os yet but ridiculously over priced i 'll admit i'm no fan of microsoft but i 've very few problems with my desktop once i upgraded from windows me	4
0	they sent me a product that was n't legit and would n't take it back horrible service i do n't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor ! just a horrible waste of time money	4
0	i received the package and read the instructions in retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well it did not my installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless i had to take it to a professional to get it going even so i have had problems with internet explorer stopping suddenly bsod 's this is not a job for the average computer user	4
0	the title of this product is a joke it should be called not easy cd burning roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is it is way too complicated for burning simple cds	4
0	first of all this software performs like someones term project why havent these guys been sued yet \? pros nice retail packagingcons not testeddoesnt burn all your filesno supportoverall a waste of moner	4
0	i recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive \( hl dt st rw dvd gcc 4482b \( 1 00 \) i have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times no response i did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to roxio needless to say i am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software i have a new gateway desktop that came with the above drive	4
0	i found this program simple easy to operate however when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio the narration matched each picture perfectly when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off do not count on any tech support they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all you have the option of forking over 35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone but it still does not guarantee it will help and now i'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	4
0	i used easy creator 4 for years bought new computers so bought easy creator 6 it will not work on 2 e machines with xp it wipes out cd rom drive so that it is unusable i requested tech support 6 12 06 it 's 7 15 06 and i am still waiting i uninstalled it i found easy creator 5 platinum on amazon and ordered it it works	4
0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4
0	this product does nothing i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn everything is copy protected and i hear that over and over again there is a reason why this product is so cheap because it does nothing at all ! u cant burn dvds you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player thats it dont waste you money on this its worthless	4
0	i am very disappointed with this product using the features of it are very difficult \( red eye sizing etc \) in addition digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality clarity on the computer screen i expected more from it but have found i have less i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	4
0	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album when trial time expired i purchase the full package i could not open the existing album with the new software the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found use something else ! ! ! i even e mailed corel about this its been 4 days i have not had a response do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a 2 stars	4
0	i do not like software it always hang no matter what i did maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process \? i had many many photos in my computer	4
0	i spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an update that when run errored out as soon as it began	4
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

0	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4
0	crashes on every thing i try to do i 've never seen such a poor excuse for a program i paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the trash	4
0	i used version 8 and 9 and never experienced a problem version 10 latest version is terrible crash and burn do n't take their advice and re install your operating system its their software and not the os amazon and pinnacle \( avid \) continue to sell this product even though its terrible i read it was re written for version 10 and they can't get it right nonetheless they still charge full price and for support calls the upgrade should have been free there are several good products now so pinnacle is n't your only choice i changed to sony vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve for super simple try ulead or one of the others	4
0	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 \( which i loved \) and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds what a disappointment this upgrade has been crash after crash what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could help them develop a better product this means to me that they knowingly released bad code and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a 100 guess what i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product i want a product that works when i purchase it lesson learned next time i read a bad review on a product i'm staying away	4
0	i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic \( along with correct pronounciations \) while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english	4
0	i was charged the full price of 49 95 with no 20 coupon inserted	4
0	i would not buy it ! hard to use my machine runs slower since the install	4
0	an internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates why would they give you something for nothing \? i have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items this free software could cost you 30 if the company decides they do n't want to pay	4
0	i was using vcom systemsuite pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction but after i reconfigured my pc to standard pc the software rejected my serial number claiming i was using the software on another pc i only own one pc technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc 's well that is totally incorrect because like i said i only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house they have a bug in their serial number checking process anyway they would not help me restore the software serial number because i could not furnish proof of purchase they think i am a crook i'm not i only want what i paid for to work	4
0	i agree with others who said it crashes the system overall i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth even if it were free it 's not worth all the time and effort besides all the crashes downloading the virus spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1 2 hours be forewarned in the end i returned my copy to vcom though to date i have not yet received a refund	4

0	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
0	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good the user interface is quite honestly shameful software companies got away with this years ago but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces \( e g keyboard short cuts are missing \) integration with word 2003 is weak numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow	4
0	i received this item today and was surprised1 \) it was shipped from overseas \( uk \) 2 \) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3 \) no paperwork it came in a clear case with no artwork info etc4 \) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 \( according to sonic foundry 's website \) and sf no longer provides support5 \) i ca n't get this to register online which seems a little dodgy but other than that it seems functional no huge library of loops either ca n't really say i got what i expected	4

0	i'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product there is no 800 number for tech support so it 's a long distance call i have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person they offer only email support but do n't write back if you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you but it never happens	4

0	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4
0	this product is very nice when it works however i'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me when i attempt to export the image either by saving draging or copying hemera places a transparency over the object making the product worthless i gave it two stars because for the two months it worked it worked well however now it wo n't work at all and as the other reviewer stated support is nearly non existant	4
0	when i first installed the program i was able to access the images but since that first time i have n't my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software i have since then uninstalled it i did not think this product was very easy to use	4
0	this is the worst version of adobe illustrator to be released since version 9 opens files that i 've been using for years and then writes scribbled unopenable 'saved' versions crashes ca n't save for mysterious reasons writes version 10 files with text split into pieces such a fine product ! really glad i paid money for it ! ! i downgraded back to irritator 10	4
0	i bought this product after reading the other on line reviews saying how easy it was to use i am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy ! it was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke ! i would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you 're a professional architect computer genius	4
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4

0	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4
0	this computer system although almost universally accepted can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free such as the fedora project \( a distribution of linux a os which can be changed by anyone for free \) or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 \( 90 \) or less	4
0	the mac os 129 list often cheaper does n't get viruses worms malware etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc with the exception of some games go to a mac store and try it for yourself	4
0	sorry to disappoint the believers but this os is way overpriced for what it does and it will dominate you instead of the converse	4

0	i found this program simple easy to operate however when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio the narration matched each picture perfectly when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off do not count on any tech support they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all you have the option of forking over 35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone but it still does not guarantee it will help and now i'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	4
0	i used easy creator 4 for years bought new computers so bought easy creator 6 it will not work on 2 e machines with xp it wipes out cd rom drive so that it is unusable i requested tech support 6 12 06 it 's 7 15 06 and i am still waiting i uninstalled it i found easy creator 5 platinum on amazon and ordered it it works	4
0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4
0	this product does nothing i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn everything is copy protected and i hear that over and over again there is a reason why this product is so cheap because it does nothing at all ! u cant burn dvds you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player thats it dont waste you money on this its worthless	4
0	i am very disappointed with this product using the features of it are very difficult \( red eye sizing etc \) in addition digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality clarity on the computer screen i expected more from it but have found i have less i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	4
0	i used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album when trial time expired i purchase the full package i could not open the existing album with the new software the new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000 's of templates can not be found use something else ! ! ! i even e mailed corel about this its been 4 days i have not had a response do not buy ! ! ! i rate this produce as a 2 stars	4

0	i spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an update that when run errored out as soon as it began	4
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4
0	my boss asked me to get this so that he check out the latin portion of it what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is latin american spanish the interface was underwhelming i needed to guess at what did what because the controls are mostly icons what 's worse there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program apparently though the manufacturer did throw in an extra not listed on the back if you are learning the differences between us and uk english its there ! i gave this one star only because i could n't give it no stars	4
0	i found this title messing around adding things to my wish list i only read the blurb on amazon enough to see haitian creaole listed as one of the languages today updating my wish list i took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more ! how unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake i almost made buying this in hopes of it having haitian creole ! very disappointing ! ! ! ! the makers should be ashamed	4
0	they have the hebrew backwards ! ! you are supposed to read hebrew right to left the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right i find it extremely confusing i know how to read hebrew and i wanted to learn how to speak it what a poor effort !	4
0	i just bought and installed this cd with the hopes of learning some haitian creole and i too could n't find it there is absolutely nothing on the installation cd that mentions either haiti or creole except the jewel case which insists it 's there i'm so dissapointed i have n't actually tested anything else out i consider this a very bad start	4

0	i used version 8 and 9 and never experienced a problem version 10 latest version is terrible crash and burn do n't take their advice and re install your operating system its their software and not the os amazon and pinnacle \( avid \) continue to sell this product even though its terrible i read it was re written for version 10 and they can't get it right nonetheless they still charge full price and for support calls the upgrade should have been free there are several good products now so pinnacle is n't your only choice i changed to sony vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve for super simple try ulead or one of the others	4
0	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 \( which i loved \) and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds what a disappointment this upgrade has been crash after crash what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could help them develop a better product this means to me that they knowingly released bad code and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a 100 guess what i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product i want a product that works when i purchase it lesson learned next time i read a bad review on a product i'm staying away	4
0	i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic \( along with correct pronounciations \) while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english	4
0	i was charged the full price of 49 95 with no 20 coupon inserted	4

0	an internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates why would they give you something for nothing \? i have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items this free software could cost you 30 if the company decides they do n't want to pay	4
0	i was using vcom systemsuite pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction but after i reconfigured my pc to standard pc the software rejected my serial number claiming i was using the software on another pc i only own one pc technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc 's well that is totally incorrect because like i said i only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house they have a bug in their serial number checking process anyway they would not help me restore the software serial number because i could not furnish proof of purchase they think i am a crook i'm not i only want what i paid for to work	4
0	i agree with others who said it crashes the system overall i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth even if it were free it 's not worth all the time and effort besides all the crashes downloading the virus spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1 2 hours be forewarned in the end i returned my copy to vcom though to date i have not yet received a refund	4
0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
0	this is the worst thing i have ever bought i bought it because i am having some trouble in spanish in school i bought it thinking that if i gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa but all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word so save your self 20 dollars and do n't buy thi	4
0	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
0	the definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good the user interface is quite honestly shameful software companies got away with this years ago but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces \( e g keyboard short cuts are missing \) integration with word 2003 is weak numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow	4
0	this product could put user customer 's life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off road this is the worst product that i have used in my life	4

0	i was expecting a lot more from these two cd 's it teaches you a few items of food basic words like hello please and airplane and even teaches you to ask where are the suitcases but then that is about it i was really hoping for more much more	4
0	i received this item today and was surprised1 \) it was shipped from overseas \( uk \) 2 \) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3 \) no paperwork it came in a clear case with no artwork info etc4 \) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 \( according to sonic foundry 's website \) and sf no longer provides support5 \) i ca n't get this to register online which seems a little dodgy but other than that it seems functional no huge library of loops either ca n't really say i got what i expected	4

0	i'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product there is no 800 number for tech support so it 's a long distance call i have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person they offer only email support but do n't write back if you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you but it never happens	4
0	this game was a little too hard for my tastes despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back \( all the corridors look alike \) so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft gotten caught breaking and entering been crushed by an elevator frozen to death and been hit over the head i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children	4

0	i wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool this program does not do well with fixing red eye software did not come with a manual i am computer literate yet i found this software not easy to navigate i found hp essentials which is a free download from the hp website to be a better program	4
0	i tried unsuccessfully several times to install it i contact their alleged support they sent me what they deemed a fix the fix was awful it caused my computer to crash and print shop would never work broderbund used to be a good company but i 've had nothing but problems with their software of late they need to rethink their products their support and their company focus they are lousy at this point they obviously do n't give a dang about quality support or their customers	4
0	do not order this tech support from broderbund is basically non existant one sorry product	4
0	on the front of the box it says it can be used for professional photo editing and has 20 000 professionally designed projects when i received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re sale i purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software 's and now i find out it is totally worthless to me i went to there website and it says allow 4 6 weeks for a refund ! i am going to turn them into the ftc for false advertisement	4
0	if you own a newer dvd camcorder that is manufactured by panasonic hitachi and others that records your movies in a vro format you can not use this product you will have to buy an additional program that will cost about 40 to convert the vro format to a avi wav or mpeg format if you own a camcorder that records in vro do some research before you waste 80 on this program	4
0	this is a very capable program that has too many nuances for just a simple dvd burn it is far to complex definitely for the advanced user i am sorry that i spent the money	4
0	i really thought that office was better proir to the whole xp upgrade but that i will leave to other discussions this product is your standard microsoft office products i am fairly sure that most have experienced their products there are no surprises and the added bells and whistles are n't worth the upgrade unless your are a vba programmer now having gone through all of this i do not rcommend that you purchase this product but purchase the student version same product hugely different price	4

0	nsw 2007 \( or 2006 \) premiere is useless when it comes to vista and considering it comes pre packaged with every pc known to man \( desktop or laptop \) this is unforgiveable norton av has an update but that is a far cry from the 100 price of systemworks that must be uninstalled according to ms vista maybe with the 2008 versiontruth be known system works has saved my azz a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless	4
0	systemworks continues to grow taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer and i'm likely to buy an alternative next time i update note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer a new hard drive motherboard or processor and symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy i like the basic functions but there 's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	4
0	this is a terrible suite read the fine print very carefully it will not work on raid configurations of any kind it will tell you that in the install \( thanks a lot kinda late \? \) i found its support on recovery disc of usb hardware unstable this is a very unstable even errant set of programs it also tries to take over a lot of system elements	4
0	i 've a norton user for many years i 'upgraded \? ' from nav 2005 this product was a pain to install i had to uninstall zone alarm which is n't noted anywhere i 've never had to do that before the installation process required rebooting multiple times in the past it had been an easy process not anymore ! i will not buy norton in the future	4
0	while installing norton antivirus 2007 xp a norton message flashed that i must delete webroot for msn i did it and it resulted in crashing the session tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait then ried the online chat the wait went on for 9hrs started 245 in the queue and by now in lline at 59 i realized this was not the norton i 'd used for so many years i ordered kapersky anti virus	4
0	i tried to like this product as previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations if you only need a 2d floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less the object libraries that come with the tool furniture fabrics etc are really lame this limits it 's value as an interior design tool i did not attempt to return it so i cannot comment on their return policy	4
0	this lame program is completely limiting you can not even type in your own text you are supposed to use the few quotes they want you to use it is not at all user friendly either i am so sorry i purchased this	4
0	this is a good product except it keeps shutting down when i have my outlook or when i have a web page open my main goal for an antivirus would be to run when i search the web or get in new emails ! what good is it if it shuts down when these are open ! it did find a trojan on my first scan this was one that norton missed i will be getting nod32 soon sorry this product did not work for me ! it was very easy to use	4
0	this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix it turns them a light shade of grey maybe it is horrible this to me renders it useless it is for the most basic of users there are no real manual functions to speak of and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly i would say do not buy seller was great product is poor	4
0	it is n't very user friendly i have other software that is much easier \( adobe photo shop \) this one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with	4
0	on install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced my pictures folder with another containing only sample picture yep it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use this program seems to be unsupported by microsoft least their support site wo n't let you mail them on it so when it does hack up your file structure so program cost me 15 recovery effort on pictures over 50 just wonderful	4
0	after using this product for mac for over 10 years i'm done the price keeps going up the tax help within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non existent the server meltdown this year was the last straw their servers were n't too busy to let me pay to efile but apparently they were surprised by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service baloney i 'll use a pencil and paper next year before i give intuit another 100	4
0	turbo tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions it seems to view short sales as errors reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold it does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale it does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months but covered by disqualifying call options its screens for schedule d and d1 are awkward it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions with tags to set short term and long term tax application from which d and d1 could be formatted for filing	4
0	both versions of scansoft cause my installer to have problems mainly it tries to re install softscan every time i start up softscan also it has started to try and reinstall softscan if i try to right click on a jpg there is very little to no chance of getting any help from scansoft \( nuance \) to debug this problem save your money and buy some thing else	4
0	omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes \( often occuring at the end of a lengthy process \) nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want 9 95 for an email question or 19 95 for a phone question you might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of omnipage you would expect some support i recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support	4
0	the real headache began when i attempted to activate the program i spent hours trying to activate it to no avail i got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems now i would just like to get my money back i have used scansoft 's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it but for whatever reason omnipage 15 has become for me an expensive nightmare after having spent many hours trying to activate it i still have not succeeded their support leaves a lot to be desired for one thing they keep bankers hours so do n't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours	4

0	other than the substandard security the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware protecting against viruses etc and the fact that microsoft has built in it 's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet it 's pretty good it is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive if you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags buy a mac as you face the upgrade to ms vista you 're going to need to upgrade your cpu so you are essentially at a crossroads good luck	4

0	i purchased this updated version 1 5 07 it does not print correctly and technical support assured me that the developer is working on the problem and a fix is soon to come this is march 1 and no update is available yet this program is un usable and i am very unhappy and would not recommend as is to anyone i have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it this is a large embarrassment to the hallmark company	4
0	i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage 2002 for years it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do n't think my latest sites would be up yet sorry i do n't mean to be mean it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically i'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade i do n't know	4
0	there is no excuse for norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as zonealarm before installing the software especially since previous versions have been compatible once opened returning the product can be a problem perhaps that it what norton is counting on	4
0	i 've been a loyal norton anti virus utilities software customer since the stone age but like several other reviewers i'm deeply disappointed that norton internet security 2007 is incompatible with zonealarm pro sunbelt counterspy and microsoft antispyware and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out once upon a time norton was the epitome of well designed thoughtful customer centric software but they 've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well established name i 'll be returning symantec 's software if i can and buying zonealarm 's a v package instead	4
0	when i tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 i ran into a problem because i did n't have flash 7 0 installed actually i had a later version of flash \( 9 04 \) but of course quickbooks could n't handle that here 's the fix go to the adobe site and download the uninstall program from them uninstall your flash player and then quickbooks will then proceed good luck jo	4
0	i bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant well after trying to use it for two years now i'm ready to burn it it 's a great software for people who do their business by the projects but it 's not good for retail sales everything has been a hassel especially trying to set up the daily sales so i can record detailed inventory of my daily sales yes i noticed they did come out w a new version for specifically for retail sales after i already invested in 300 in software and 100 in books just trying to learn this system what a waste !	4
0	what a bunch of money grabbing idiots ! if you are considering buying quickbooks don't ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have never had such a horrible experience with a product they take features away especially with payroll if you do not buy their products then when you call to ask what is going on they tell you that you have not purchased their support program and that they cannot help you ! ! i hate quick books their is nothing quick about it and the so called support staff are a bunch of liars ! !	4
0	i have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money every other page is a sales page and after paying 300 plus for the application and another 200 for the payroll now i have to pay if i want their help it is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money no longer has anything to do with their customers and this customer will not be one next year	4
0	purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break i have a very small business so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated the customer service was no help could n't answer my questions i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right another day wasted i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money but i'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime if this is quick books i need to find lightning fast books somewhere	4
0	i'm still waiting amazon says this item usually ships within 24 hours i ordered on oct 27 its now nov 8 and it still has n't shipped where is it	4
0	no technical support that's worth anything ! program does not work properly ! very user unfriendly ! otherwise i wish i would not have purchased it ! need something the average computer nut can use effectively	4
0	what a terrible upgrade i'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6 even though i specifically told it to leave my file associations alone it changed every one of them it 's a nightmare i'm still trying to get nero disassociated with certain file types to no avail the backup program is awful slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6 overall ultra 6 is a much better product i'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to nero with instructions on where they can associate it	4
0	great software ! until you have a question or a problem that is then you get the run around big time ! zonealarm says they did n't sell it to me so they ca n't help me they send me to broderbund for help broderbund then sends me to encore for help and they wo n't help me either zonealarm states if i did n't buy it right from zonealarm then they do n't give any support it comes in a zonealarm box says zonealarm on the cd but apparently it is n't zonealarm \? \? \? \( according to zonealarm that is \) ! ! buy it elsewhere or end up helpless ! ! !	4
0	i have used the zonlabs firewall for several years it works fine i can not say the same for the security suite the antispam function does not update definitions and zonelabs tech support know they have a problem they are working on it but no date for a fix do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed	4
0	i do not have any recolection of purchasing this product nor can i find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files i have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from zone alarm there is no hard disk no computer file i am about to raise you know what about this charge on my credit card i will challenge it if i do not receive for what i am being charged i will also ask my credit card co for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks in the future i will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet rehadik netscape	4
0	i was reading the high reviews of zonealarm so i went to their web site to get more information and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them going back to panda	4
0	it 's been 10 days since i registered with zone alarm and i still have n't received the license key i wrote many emails and called customer service and i got no help or solution think twice before purchasing this product	4
0	i really like the rosetta stone product \( although it is over priced \) warning rosetta stone \( fairfield language technologies \) will not replace a cd if it is lost stolen or damaged unless you bought the product directly from them \( and then they charge you 30 for a replacement cd \) i had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package in this case i can get my money back from the store i bought it from but since you ca n't backup the disks you had better be very careful to not lose one	4
0	i 've used the past few versions of acrobat and this one is a disappointment navigation is a pain instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page adobe 's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow the whole look and feel is most unmac like more like a windows application i suppose if i wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual i would find the application friendlier but i do n't expect to have to re learn to use an application when i upgrade if you 're thinking of upgrading my advice is do n't	4
0	i upgraded from wordperfect office 12 to x3 but have returned the upgrade to wordperfect the much touted ability to import pdf files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable in addition the wordperfect mail component will not load data files while my antivirus \( zonealarm \) is running in the background corel technical support takes no responsibility for the incompatability do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed	4
0	generally like the program hoped it came with a cd to practice in the car but was wrong it is totally pc based i 'll let you know in about three months if i can actually conduct business in deutsch	4
0	i have many \( too many \) rosetta stone softwares for language learning however after purchasing tell me more software i will never go back to rosetta stone it is true that you can learn a lot of vocabulary with rosetta 's program but that is about it ! rosetta 's software is very illogical ! honestly do not waste your time and money with this program check tell me more and you will be amazed	4
0	quickbooks sunsetted my previous version forcing me to buy this horriblle buggy software it lacks many of the features that i liked from my previous version \( 2003 \) runs much slower uses 10 times as much memory and is full of bugs i regularly need to run windows system restore when all of my company data disappears avoid this product at all costs time that i used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work i have used quickbooks for 12 years and 4 editions but this will be my last intuit product i wish i could give it 0 stars	4
0	this is a great programme with windows xp but be aware that it conflicts with vista the latest version of windows an upgrade is recommended by nuance the manufacturer to omnipage at double the cost of textbridge	4
0	i purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer the document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that i simply had to re type it would have taken longer to correct than to re type when i talked to textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that i should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities in other words they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it the program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else	4
0	this product simply does not produce accurate results it skips entire lines words on the same line and misreads even the most legible characters it came bundled with my scanner so at least i did not waste my money on it do n't waste yours	4
0	i have been a faithful mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids this game is a big disappointment the language game is virtually unplayable in french i am fluent in french and went to a french language university for nine years i could barely understand what the characters were saying if this program is intended to teach kids a second language it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead this game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of french	4
0	after over a year and a half including renewing for updates i 've now discarded norton sw 2006 it was problamatic and a waste of money it conflicts with partition magic another symantec product and will not work with many ms updates my system is now operating trouble free since i 've uninstalled nsw previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently	4

0	despite generally good experiences with microsoft products windows live onecare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new lenovo pc running windows xp i removed it and performance has improved back to where it was now running mcafee for virus scanning etc	4
0	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	4
0	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too the colors were spot on after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse my monitor appears dim the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time my hope was that it would make my monitor look better not worse i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	4
0	i had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile then the product asked later for a re input of the serial number which i no longer had no big deal contact customer service right \? contacted customer service via email once got no response sent a second email and got a response asking a follow up question since then nothing no response nada all follow ups ignored perhaps this product will work for you but for me it ultimately went into the trash because of colorvision 's refusal to respond do n't support this product they wo n't support you	4
0	the product is so so there are others that do the same thing for a bit less but colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support you are screwed between putting you on hold for ever not calling back etc	4
0	worked okay until i installed xp service pack 2 now i can no longer scan using my brother mfc 9700 and paperport 9 it has been a long time since service pack 2 was released and scansoft has left everyone who bought paperport 9 in the cold i could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with sp2 this kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business do n't take my word for it google the issue and you 'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers from now on i 'll avoid scansoft	4

0	i agree with reviewer mr dietz i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for 24 99 put it in and loaded it in this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all no help menu either we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her there is nothing here to learn chess from	4
0	i was looking for an intructional cd to help my daughter to learn chess i read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what i was looking for wrong ! first of all the cd comes with no instruction book and you 're left to try and figure out what you 're supposed to do by yourself \( good luck \) i 've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and i still have n't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess i 've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them save your money and your sanity and do n't buy this cd	4
0	the product was easy to install but there was a trick i noticed a day after installing the software i ran full scan to try the sincerity of the software i downloaded same free trial to my chagrin i was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15 my question now is are all these gimmicks	4
0	i am a software tech i first free trial v6 online 1 finds 131 errors but will only fix 4 \( must buy full version ! \) sheesh ! 2 buy full version with 20 off coupon \( 3 computer lic for only 9 95 more their web site \) 3 does not remove left overs from old uninstalled pgms \( fix it utilities 6 safely did read my review \) 4 then they only support updates for 1 year auto renew ! rip off ! i got a refund and will never use them again	4
0	be warned this product does not support all advertised features on all phones right out of the box i found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones of the phones that it did support the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync the ability to transfer other data such as movies contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone without all of the advertised features are available i consider this a complete waste of money	4
0	it will not work in my windows xp i have repeatedly asked for help no one answers finally i was told to look it up on a databank if you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you but if you work for a living you 've been had by this company encoreusa	4
0	we were big fans of taxcut especially after turbo added spyware this year's tax cut has irreguarities that are costing \( \) me for example you file your college student 's return and check the box that she he will be an exemption on the head of household return then comes the surprise head of household ca n't file their return with that college student as an exemption despite checking the proper boxes ! for example it ca n't caluculate railroad retirement benefits for example it tells you that your return is a okay you pay 15 then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another 15 to refile ! good bye tax cut !	4
0	two weeks ago i attempted to do my taxes on this software however it could n't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so i could file i had two weeks until the update was available i downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told i had a credit of 3 100 however it never added this number to my total tax credits all customer support could come up with was start over from scratch do n't even import your information from last year 's taxcut never again	4
0	i have thought well of every operating system since dos 3 1 this is without a doubt the worst system i have ever seen not only is it not graphicaly intuitive it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software trying to use quicken will crash the computer it is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person 's softwarein order to use vista the only thing you will get out of running vista is a lot of headaches	4
0	i had a problem at the end of the process in that the program indicated no errors but when you went to print the return the message stated that there were errors on the return i contacted turbo tax directly but they had no explanation they simply said that they had received a couple of calls about this problem that was it	4
0	turbo tax is fine the linking into quickbooks pro \( qbp \) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of qbp so if you have an older version \( older than 2005 \) you have to buy the new qbp to have turbo tax lift the data out of qb now intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 no more ungrades for the consumer they will tell you bs i will be changing accounting platforms as soon as i can find a replacement this is the problem with software oligolopies ! an open source replacement is much needed for both tax prep and accounting	4
0	this might be the greatest mapping program in existance but i would never know very user unfriendly there is no instruction book provided with it \( or available that i can find \) the help function is very poor and does n't provide adequate instructions if you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites	4
0	the benefits may be great but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis	4
0	comment made by the user after about 30 minutes begged me never to make him use it again	4
0	although it says that this works for all versions of photoshop it does not upgrade from photoshop elements i spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it	4
0	turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040a to file but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region not only that but if you have complications with trying to file good luck it looks as though i will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed ttax is worthless	4
0	you can bet those people gaving vista a good rating here work for the company it 's a piece of junk if you have a good working xp or anything else please do n't buy vista i bought it a month ago already installed on a good hp computer i 've worked on it from sun up to sun down for a month and still all i 've got is a pile of junk and it 's so slow that you have to take a coffee break while it 's gathering up a program to run do n't buy their one care either i 've owned windows since 98 i'm considering re installing my old hp xp it 's still here in the closet	4
0	this was horrible i installed this and within a 24 hour period i was slammed with pop ups and spam and good luck trying to remove it very dissatisfied customer	4
0	i just bought this yesterday and though the product description here on amazon says it 's compatible with windows 98 and windows me the packaging says taxcut usb drive is compatible with windows 2000 and windows xp all our taxes for several years have been done on a windows me computer with a usb port now what \? help !	4
0	the system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about mac support and requires windows h r block did n't support mac 's last year and they 've only given half hearted support this year if you own a mac then turbotax is your best bet	4
0	i worked hard on a vcd project for work using photo explosion i did n't think it was that easy to use but it was okay until i got ready to burn got a little error message that said something along the lines of you do n't have nero burners ! no kidding but there are four other burn programs on my computer nothing but nero would do nowhere on the box are you informed of this it says and i quote burn cd slideshows you can watch on tv ! needing more software is never mentioned as far as i'm concerned this product makes fraudulent claims i will never buy another one of their products	4

0	this software messed up my computer big time it does something first of all to microsoft word word does not work properly after installation of photo explosion it then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up at first i only suspected it to be photo explosion i had to have my computer sent back to hp when i got it back i reinstalled photo explosion and the same thing happenend be careful product has big problems which will give you bigger problems i guarantee it	4
0	the editing portion of the software is completly separate from the cd portion of the software and does not store in the same file cd 's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500 i was told by nova development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the cd writer was a free add on to the program the box and program info did not indicate that i offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere	4
0	lacks transitions between slides of digital pictures makes the slideshow somewhat flat one good thing can put music and also is quite fast in creating a vc	4
0	having just paid for this product i expected the word processing component to have at least the basics wrong to me the ability to easily format a business or legal document with page x of y at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental well works 8 5 unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs does not provide that choice without this basic a feature you might as well simply use wordpad i cannot comment on other abilities this program has or does n't have or on the spreadsheet or database modules because i simply do n't want to spend any more time on this recommendation go to openoffice org and get open office for free	4
0	after installing this software in to my pc some functions of my keyboard stopped working even some multimedia buttons disappeared after that i had to concatct hp to download drivers again even after installing the drivers it did not start working as beore till i uninstalled this third rate software from my pc after uninstalling every thing got fine i will not recommand this soft ware to any one	4
0	the program crashed during setup when i finally got it installed it crashed my machine every night until i uninstalled it	4
0	found the registration number difficult to read had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time ! the i 's look like 1 's tried it again ! i got it to load my computer slowed down significantly ! certain sites i could not access anymore without re configuring the software i have used norton mcaffee or whatever and other suite type security software this one was the worst i would not recommend it i got a well deserved refund	4
0	i was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free the manufacturer computer associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too as for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl after a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed	4
0	i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them h r taxcut included all i needed and was 1 2 the price	4
0	this was the most user unfriendly turbotax i have ever used the schedule c imported misinformation had to keep forcing in the correct info and i just found out my state taxes were received showing i owed a completely different amount than what i had electronically filed i have used this program for years but after this never again ! ! ! let this be a warning to others	4
0	i had the exact same experience as another reviewer loved it for years changed formats no confidence at the last minute i had to use an accountant the accountant cost me 650 00 50 more than what i was over paying in taxes using this software a disaster it does n't look like it was importing data correctly state navigation really was painful i buy this software to try different senerios \( joint or single \) but this year it would n't do that probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software to my mind the software is crippled	4
0	if i could give less than 1 star for any trend micro product i would it gives too many false positives when you do n't even have a virus you are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as trend told you there was avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money it 's a piece of crap	4
0	my subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew they are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software 2005 works fine until i have been thru the runaround 3 times with e mail customer support i wo n't pay for their telephone customer support trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this shame on you pcillin	4
0	when i click the update components i'm continually told that the feature is still initializing please try again later this will happen even if i 've had the program open for hours i 've contacted trend micro followed their instructions for a workaround but that still did n't help	4
0	so far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it we contacted tech support but after one call we will be charged 19 95 for each call i have been disappointed in the product and the company	4
0	very awesome program for adults and chidren lots of information on the kids encarta my son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself	4
0	i 'd be happy to write a review if i could ever get a working copy of this program three different computers and not one would the disc install on	4
0	this software only got one star because i couldnt give it a zero it never worked on my windows xp computer i couldnt open the program couldnt close it couldnt get the sytem to shut down after a hard shutdown windows would not start tech support couldnt figure out the problem i uninstalled panda reinstalled norton and system is working fine i would not recommend	4
0	this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip forcing the ribbon on the user assumes that the user likes icons \( i do n't what 's wrong with words \? \? \) and fills too much of the screen real estate nothing is where it should be and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views no classic view just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons another oppressive giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft	4
0	i bought the software some months ago noticed some problems with my pc in subsequent weeks did n't put 2 and 2 together last week however i 'd come home no icons on screen no ability to ctrl alt del each day this would happen the machine had to be powered on and off to reboot pulled recent software off machine yes you 've guessed without spy sweeper i have no problems ok it might be a conflict with other software a quick google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems i was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either but then maybe my machine is clean	4
0	i made the mistake of buying a two year subscription every upgrade slows the product down a scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour stay away from this junk there are much better free products available	4
0	i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware also when computers come in to be cleaned up no one uses this program \( even though we 're supposed to recommend it \) i would recommend xoft pest patrol or ms antispyware much much more	4
0	the bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things do n't go as planned customer service exists but their reps claim they ca n't do anything about your problem their manners are less than acceptable rude seems to be the in thing at this company as consumers we have options one of which is to ge elsewhere i am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned it 's too bad	4
0	do n't buy zone alarm if you use aol they are not compatable the pop ups will drive you crazy and aol wo n't work properly also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed i bought it from amazon and had to throw it away in a month no refund money lost norton is far better with aol	4
0	this screensaver is terrible it pauses and jerks around very annoying i emailed the company and never heard from them i dont use it and i dont recommend it to anybody thank yo	4
0	it seems that all previous quickbook versions will not run on windows vista and i had upgraded my system so i bought simple start as the least expensive way to get a quickbook product to run on vista turns out simple start runs fine on vista but you cannot load a company file from earlier versions thus simple start was simply useless to me when i called intuit customer service they said that for another 100 they 'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature by that time i was committed and had no choice talk about getting ripped off ! !	4
0	i read the review saying simple start did n't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version despite the warning i thought i could get away with simple start because i was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program even for my simple needs it was a bust i had to upgrade to pro for an additional 100 if quicken is n't enough for your needs get pro	4
0	if you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one intuit offers excpect to get what you pay for if your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet or downloading the free version from microsoft or even using their home version with business added by the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it bottom line if you want a good quickbooks bump up to the pro version so you can get real customer and vendor management and a decent overview summary and multiple category levels	4
0	great product but shame on amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software kudos to acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10 acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful	4
0	this item has not been received in 25 days ! no help from vendo	4
0	this is not the most recent version for this software do an online search check the manufacturer 's web site and you 'll find it cheaper for the latest version	4
0	it 's not working with my toshiba tecra m2 laptop it keeps wanting an update to my video driver that does n't exist	4
0	i 've had dazzle products in the past usually a very good product this dvd recorder is just not very reliable i would recommmend spending a little more and getting one of the higher end dazzle products	4
0	i found this software very difficult to use it does not have any stop or go back button the only way to exit an activity is to hit esc button to exit the program and then start all over when starting over there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and i could not find a way to skip it	4
0	i bought two of the mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed class i bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother \( caregiver \) passed away the storyline of the game is that mia has to save her gravely ill grandmother then she gets mugged by a rat ! i feel this is a little to noir for small children the math game \( which i am returning unopened \) is about her house burning down and if she could prevent it by going back through time i feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects i am returning both games	4
0	the creators of mia 's reading adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children 's games there is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child 's effort if you 're looking to teach your pre k k child reading skills i 'd recommend the blue 's clues games instead any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did	4
0	aquazone is good but i 've found that serene scene is a better product aquazone is not as realistic as serene scene and that is what i was looking for the realism of fish in an aquarium if i could go back i would buy serene scene instead	4
0	i had to return this product i have a newer g5 imac with all os x updates and as a program it worked but if you buying this for a sreensaver like i did the product did n't work i tried emailing and posted a question on allume forum got no response	4
0	i purchased this item for 10 from comp usa there was a problem with some of the files so when i finished installing it my computer was a mess i lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else it took me a while to get the program removed and i eventually ended up doing a system restore when the screensaver came up it did look awesome i wish i could have used it but i am not going to try and install it again	4
0	in wandering around the web i find i am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing \( from photoshop elements 5 \) when importing lightroom thinks for a long time \( that 's fine and they do warn you it can be slow \) but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import about the rest of the program \? i do n't know too frustrated just trying to get it up and running	4
0	i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders i did go to the nuance website before ordering they did n't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard anyway if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing you need the preferred version not this one	4
0	i'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade \? you 'll wish you had the xp upgrade as soon as you do it it 's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product	4
0	not unless you are comfortable editing your registry to get your dvd cd drive to work	4
0	i have a 3 2 ghz 2 gb pc clearly ready for vista after running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict \( even the optional conflicts the second time around \) they told me it would install yet it did n't after an hour of installing it tells me the installation fails and restores xp i realise that mine is an isolated case but it 's typical microsoft if you want something that works buy a mac	4
0	i ca n't get the software to scan past 30 the software locks up when i try to end the scan after being stuck at 30 scan	4
0	in the instruction pamphlet under scan tools there is a list of what the program scans one of the functions is a registry scanner this is a fast scanner that analyzes the windows registry for traces of known malware the bottom line i have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the spyware doctor does n't know it 's there i do keep spyware doctor up to date i'm still looking for an effective spyware application	4
0	there 's a fundamental flaw in the software it wo n't print a greeting card properly unless you have a borderless capable printer if you print on a printer that ca n't do borderless printing the front cover image on the card will be off center check the faq section of the hallmarksoftware web site and they even admit as much it 's a known bug and a 'fix' has been promised since december according to the hallmarksoftware on line forums until the fix is released if ever avoid this program	4
0	card studio 2007 has repeated many cards from card studio 2006 i bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched you have to pick a card in order to read the front very time consuming	4
0	i contacted the program 's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what i did i received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of january mid february i asked again about it as there had been no fix that time they said it would be fixed by the end of february i 've used their previous programs w out problems just wanted more variety so added this one apparently not a good idea	4
0	i bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it i have a mac pro running the latest version of mac os i installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution which is kind of silly in this day and age but that works ok what does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes pretty unworkable do n't bother buying this for a mac	4
0	no support or response to questions only 1 2 of the functions work not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs try cosmic blobs	4
0	downloaded the new mcafee software my computer is now slowed over 90 of the speed of a snail both with aol and internet explorer mcafee customer service is of no value whatever mcafee faq describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions do n't seem to work as described what a mistake	4
0	the software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much i had to remove it on 2 and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the thre	4
0	until '07 if you had a mcafee suite but only wanted to use some of its components and use other programs for other aspects of protection that worked fine for instance i use zone alarm pro for firewall and spyware doctor for spyware and mcafee '06 just for virus this combination has worked fine but mcafee '07 wo n't install any of itself unless all other programs are removed and that 's a no go for me since some components of mcafee \( esp spyware \) were n't rated all that well by reviewers	4
0	contrary to the other review they did ship the proper 3 user version however since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100 of my systems resources and i can not find any setting to have it stop evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage what a mess of a product	4
0	this has caused serious technical errors on my systems all new laptops desktops it will cause ms word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system possibly requiring you to re install your vista os worked well in windows xp and office 2003 environment and they claim this is vista compatible along with paperport 11 the company will not offer me a refund i will pursue	4
0	freezes ie 7 and you have to close out and restart besides that the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the print as image selection for anything that is scanned overall it is ok and with the vast price difference with adobe i can live with it but make no mistake this program is far inferior to the adobe product	4
0	i deinstall the product after two weeks of use it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing also the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often non functional	4
0	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return and it calculated that i owed the state 550 for underpayment as well as a 230 penalty for late payment i tried working through the program several times to find the error i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem which i was not able to resolve in frustration i went to and filed my return easily within an hour with a 140 return from the state rather than a 780 penalty	4
0	ok the maps are good but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car it is very disracting and can easily cause an accident does not work aroung lincoln tunnel area also would not find my home street and i have been there for 2 years either the one i got was defected or its not what other make it out to be i had to return mine	4
0	does n't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a gps simply shows you where you are nothing more than a glorified paper map a complete embarassment	4
0	this product is nothing like the desktop version of the software so limited in functions you might as well have a paper map	4
0	this is simply awful ! i would expect this type of performance from some no name brand software purchased at a flea market not from microsoft ! i think they must of contracted this off to some really low bidder i had more satisfaction tossing the software into the trash than trying to auction it off on some internet site i think i 'll go with the tomtom navigator software instead	4
0	i guess i'm to dumb to purchase an item like this i followed the instructions to the letter and it 's not working i guess i should have read the small print sent an e mail to xitel for help and waiting for response will re rate later	4
0	while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool i found it did not help with conversation	4
0	i 've been a user of quicken for at least ten years i 've liked the product historically but this version is garbage like other users i too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error guess what \? there 's nothing i can do i ca n't go back to a previous version of quicken because my data file is n't compatable honestly i blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first i was brand loyal to intuit but now i'm paying the price the software is garbage stay away	4
0	this is an extremely flawed software program i have used quicken for more than a decade and this product is not worthy of the name runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going it contains 6 bank accounts which i cannot currently print checks from i have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success i have used every suggestion from tech support and the quicken forums without any success i guess i 'll have to move to ms money	4
0	it 's definitely an awful piece of software it 's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7 follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06	4
0	looks nice but beware ! installed norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office as soon as i did that our accounting system \( peachtree \) started to lock up a few times a day even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up i 've now uninstalled norton 360 on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security 2005 to 2007 never again	4
0	installed great looked good day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' amazon even \? after a week of back and forth 'support' they could n't fix it and left me with a partially working pc to drown the pc support is partially automated as they did n't read my responses and their advice went in circles plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare it might work on xp but do n't get it if you have vista	4
0	the video editing part of this software is completely useless it did n't come with a manual and i ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it it has n't made a difference the software is completely uncooperative my computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program if you bought this software for the video editing i recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else	4
0	the features of the program are great but it crashes way too much my computer system is fully adequate for video editing so that is not the problem i 've gotten to the point where i save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash	4
0	the video editing component of this package video wave worked great for me for about a year but it has recently turned into a nightmare ! the audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video and after trying everything i'm convinced that its a problem with the code a quick product search will show others who have had similar problems i would stay away	4
0	the video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out the tools are not explained and there is n't as much to do with it as they imply may be nice for birthday party editing i do n't know i did n't like it it 's not worth 100 the other capabilities might be nice but from what i 've dealt with that 's not the case	4
0	once i figured this software out i was able to do a slideshow of my pictures integrate video and produce a decent dvd only problem is it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4 3 whereas my dvd camcorder shoots in 16 9 this sucks i have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16 9 roxio support did e mail me back with the blanket statement that it does n't support 16 9 at this time even in the new 7 5 version roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen	4
0	i foolishly purchased 7 0 it worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system funny it started hanging up when 7 5 was released i tried to get customer support but that 's a joke do yourself a favor do not buy anything from roxio i 'd given this software negative stars if i could spend your money elsewhere	4
0	this is an item that i purchased from amazon com that i am not satisfied with i cannot install the game on my computer to play it i had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play she believes that it could be a damaged disk and that i should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy i hope you can help me with this thank you for your support sharon moseley	4
0	i am extremely unhappy with this product it is defective i gave it as a christmas gift to my daughter and was very disappointed to learn that it does not work	4
0	i read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk i thought this could n't possibly happen on my high tech computer i was wrong even though i purchased a legitamate copy the program still would not let me run it buyer beware ! ! ! ! !	4
0	i changed from quicken to quickbooks and regret it yes quick books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but i have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards i have also found it difficut to match transactions to get a better handle on my expenses i am going back to quicken or try another program online help and tutorials dummies guide not helpful either you would think see they make quicken they would allow import of qif files dissapointed	4
0	i have had to un install and reinstall three times and it still wo n't update on a very current windows xp version i hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so i have to go through line by line and create aliases i like quicken better but the accountant ca n't figure out how to import quicken into his quickbooks pro so here it is hate it hard as ever not easier the whole thing takes way too long to work with reports are a bit easier which is good or i would have tossed it out the window and bought microsoft money	4
0	the product is great calling tech support is a task though intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone if this product was n't preffered by my cpa i would never buy it ever again boycott companies that outsource to other countries keep our jobs at home !	4
0	i was very happy with my quickbooks basics but for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the basics version so i was forced to upgrade to pro 2007 it is much slower than basics it 's more complicated to back up \( it asks so many questions \) also it takes longer to print a simple check \( again too many clicks before it prints	4
0	i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem so i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista it does not the software crashes at odd times it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day i have set up my old computer which runs xp so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os	4
0	no support you have to pay 9 95 to send an email support question still cannot print annotations in pdf files that you create there is a workaround nuance should change their name to nuisance i hope that someone comes up with an alternative	4
0	i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it boy are they right this thing is terrible after installing on windows xp sp2 as soon as i started the program it crashed now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner it crashes every time product is useless wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !	4
0	after having used this product since version 4 each version had its problems the latest version 11 has improved document indexing and searching a little bit over version 10 it does not scan both sides of pages as it did in version 10 the capture assistant crashes the program if you need support due to bugs in the program you have to pay and pay and pay	4
0	i am a little disappointed in the upgrade to microsoft office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version	4
0	i should have read these comments before ordering got an oem cd and a generic jewel box	4
0	i was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead i received nero oem suite the mpeg 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial better business bureau should be notified	4
0	as another reviewer says but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd rom package turbotax instructed me to get them by using one click update well after i update and attempt to restart the software turbotax refuses to come up at all exactly i 've re installed it over and over and the same thing happens i 've used turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this after spending hours entering in my data there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage with four days before the due date this is disasterous their support site offers no hint of a fix mac users stay away	4
0	this was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes turbotax sounded easy enough and it was pretty easy at first the software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information but the final tax forms i needed to file with were not included on the cd rom package turbotax instructed me to get them by using one click update well after i update and attempt to restart the software turbotax refuses to come up at all i ca n't speak for this software on windows machines but if you are using mac os x i suggest you explore other options first	4
0	the program does a great job in figuring my taxes but now intuit is charging for filing and the state program also i was unable to download the updates over my dial up connection i called to have a cd version mailed to me but so far i have n't received it i'm trying tax act this year it is a free program and has free filing if i can complete the turbotax version i will see if i can duplicate my return using tax act if so then good bye turbotax	4
0	i bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in cnet however i just bought a new dell inspiron e1505 that shipped with windows vista home premium and zonealarm 6 5 is flat out incompatible with the new os i downloaded zonealarm 7 0 and that is flat out incompatible as well i'm sure this is a great security suite for windows xp but beware if you have vista there seems to be no update on their website when zonelabs will release a vista compatible zonealarm \( they mention something about after january 2007 but it 's march for crying out loud ! \) so there 's my purchase price of a good product down the drain	4
0	i bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer i tried to install and half way through the set up after it had uninstalled my old programs i got a message to abort the abort left me with a damaged media program and thus far i have spent over 400 trying to re connect damaged files and programs my best advice is to wait until microsoft gets the kinks out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade	4
0	i am very disappointed in vista it took about 12 hours to install and now my computer is extremely slow i would absolutely not recommend it	4
0	the vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades	4
0	as everyone else has said this product is not at all what it should be it slows down the internet browsing to a crawl \( my laptop that has crashed several times is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with mcafee \) you ca n't close it as others have said other than uninstalling the funniest part i 've found however is that it warns you the first time it tries to access being amused i refused the program permission to update itself other than removing the program it was the best thing i did using mcafee	4
0	buyer beware this program will critically impair your system ! internet loading will be drastically crippled expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes there is no way to close mcafee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall i am going to return this first thing next week i gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades but nothing has changed if only i had read the reviews ahead of time bottomline if you do n't mind these side effects by all means purchase this program mcafee has solid protection but there are easier ways to get that protection	4
0	i installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl i deinstalled it installed norton 2005 bought the subscription renewal and my laptop is back up to speed you have been warne	4
0	do not use this product it is very hard to remove from your computer it is harder to install than norton and is an inferior product i will never buy their product again	4
0	this software is one time use ! if you have a notebook and laptop you wo n't be able to install for both ! it sucks	4
0	like some of the other reviews i loved cool edit pro then adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2 0 i use this program often and tried to give it a chance no way around it it sucks now i am going to use sonar a much better product the only thing i like about 2 0 is that you can burn to a disc from audition that is the only reason why i gave it one star this is not a user friendly program	4
0	i am not a bookkeeper without bookkeeping software i would be lost ! i own a small business and help keep books for a friend 's business i have quickbooks from 1996 and love it so i convinced my friend to get this newer version i am very disappointed with the format and see very little similarity between them aarrrgh !	4
0	i'm sure it 's a good product for beginners but i already had an older version of quickbooks \( from 1995 \) and the only way i could export import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions	4
0	i bought this product based on consumer reports review i 've had norton and mcafee in the past which slowed down my system my computer is slower to start up with zonealarm but faster than mcafee while on however most of the time i need to shut off zonealarm in order to access the internet just like another reviewer defeats the purpose do n't you think \? it also recognized my offices 's software as a virus and although i allowed access it keeps showing it as a virus i'm going to have to go to another product	4
0	the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users it seems to have bugs too starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet but i'm close	4
0	i 've been using a win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the xp version was tempting however it does not work at all in my portuguese xp after searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer 's database i was informed that it does not work in non english win xp all the previous versions worked fine in my pcs but this one was totally disappointing living in brazil i had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value i would recover shame on them	4
0	you 've got to be kidding me the fry 's salesperson told me microsoft word could n't print business cards and that i should buy this product to make high quality business cards what an incredible lie this is such a piece of junk it has almost nothing the cards look terrible a total embarassment it 's hard to use it 's easier to make it in word lies lies lies junk garbage lies lies lies	4
0	i have used lots of printmaster versions i had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so i was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me i would n't have a problem with the new one this new version is junk all the projects have to be downloaded so if you do n't have a high speed connection forget it ! i do n't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc i sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response so looks like i have to find new software	4
0	never recueved the product waiting for refund for over 6 weeks	4
0	this item puts more spyware on the pc then it takes away do not bu	4
0	the product was fine but i received an older version and as a result i could n't properly update it even after registering it as a result i purchased the newest version available directly from lavasoft and it works fine and i have had no trouble updating it why did n't you specify what version it was on your website then i could have made an informed decision \?	4
0	ordered version 1 06 but was sent v 1 05 lavasoft website will upgrade the old version if i send them my order number however they will not accept an amazon number amazon customer support said sorry that they would accept a return and provide a refund i will be more careful where i buy software in the future	4
0	slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud went back to free verison	4
0	the updates are frequent and expensive good program but it 's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading	4
0	way to many problems with this version if you want to replace all your printers scanners sound cards and so on go for it otherwise stay away	4
0	the software requires a patch not a big deal once i got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes the goofiness is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software it has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well if you are serious about trying to learn some basic conversational spanish try something else do n't waste your time or money on this one	4
0	great product for what it does ! however my experience with quicken products such as will maker is that there are no updates you 'll have to buy the next year 's version to stay up to date for changes in your state at the end of 2007 the software is obsolete	4
0	this program causes my computers to blue screen trend micro has been contacted twice but have not responded	4
0	i bought pc cillin because it has 4 stars in amazon rating which is much better than mcafee and norton but i am wrong before installed pc cillin everything is fine but after installed i can not access my yahoo email after calling customer service two times even uninstalled pc cillin i still can not access yahoo email now i have to re install windows xp it will cost me a lot of time anyone knows what wrong is	4
0	the major flaw with this product is that it 's not clear which version of office you can upgrade from note it does not work with office sbe ! ! various sources say various things even the microsoft site is n't helpful	4
0	i discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity have been on the phone with quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch \( fix \) needs to be developed so far though they have not done it	4
0	if you have not bought this yet do n't if you have but have n't installed it yet do n't i 've used quicken for years and this is the worst implentation yet the major problem an issue known to the company is that reports will not print properly on many printers wait until they issue a fix before you use this product	4
0	well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly but if you 're expecting to understand what the words actually mean i would n't recommend this i was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but i have no idea what any words in the sentence caption actually mean i 've used it for a month know and i have no greater knowledge of chinese than when i started	4
0	you 've got to be kidding me there is no english translation just pictures and mandarin phrases how are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase \? they 're suppose to be teaching mandarin to an english speaker not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language this is retarded worst product ever	4
0	their approach might work for other languages but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language which rosetta stone never explains it simply displays four pictures at you with some incomprehensible \( to a beginner \) chinese near them and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures i 've taken chinese for two years and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it i either knew the words already or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online	4
0	mutual fund basis calculations are broken updates fail on the mac not to mention no state in this edition it 's absurd how many different versions of turbotax there are this year it almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes i'm done with turbotax switching to taxcu	4
0	i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti virus programs i purchased the 3 pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer when i contacted norton they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers i will never purchase another norton product	4
0	extremely difficult to unistall endless loop do not buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience i will never use nav again	4
0	this program is causing many people difficulties i had to make two seperate calls to customer service	4
0	i have a recently purchased acrobat 8 0 professional it installed fine on my new vista machine although it cites only office 2003 products but i have ms office 2007 after installation \( and reinstallation \) no acrobat conversion options show on ms word and when trying to use acrobat directly for an ms word file conversion it first reinstalls itself and then reports that the word file \( i have tried several \) is corrupt i now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my pdf conversion i could not find out if or when adobe plans to be compatible with vista and office 2007	4
0	the first order i received for italian 1 and 2 had defective disks which were not replaced by the manufacturer when i called their customer service when i re submitted my complaint to amazon they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set however these disks also are very slow to load on my new macpro laptop and quit at times i am not able to recommend rosetta stone	4
0	i bought this as christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to italy this spring as part of a college course she is taking and she will be spending a semister there next year as well she just called me for school to help her resolve an error in the installation the install reaches 100 then states it has encountered an error and quits it remains uninstalled and is thus far unusable an awefully expensive piece of plastic that does nothing as a senior software engineer i 'd have been fired for less the rosettastone website knowledgebase offers no information on this	4
0	this software is very hard to use the help video goes too fast the manual does n't cover everything and nothing is intuitive i have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money	4
0	i work for a software company so i know a little about the user interface concept this is one of the worst packages i have ever used i just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right the automatic dimension builder did not work i had to draw it and redraw it to get the dimensions right then i added a few windows and doors and 2 porches then i tried to use the camera to get a vertical view the whole file blew up ca n't find it anywhere the manual is useless and the tutorial cd is just an overview of each topic what a waste of moeny	4
0	do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy but this software is not easy to use you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand	4
0	this is the worst software i have ever worked with everything is difficult and some things are impossible to create	4
0	i have moderate knowledge of computers etc and i found this overly complicated this is not intended for the novice however even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money i wish i had not bought it at all perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them save your money this was a waste	4
0	this product is an absolute piece of junk do not buy this product will not even load properly onto computer have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows xp platform with no success i have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer now i will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor	4
0	this game can get very boring it 's very confusing and hard to control it is sooooo frustrating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the instruction booklet does n't come in handy either like some other people i only got rabbits too i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses but only rabbits came buying this game was a big mistake it is reallly no fun do n't waste your money on this game i gave up about a month ago i 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since	4
0	when i got this game i was very excited to play it but when i played it i was very dissapointed the game was very confusing and hard to control sometimes i could n't get my person to go where i wanted it to go learn from my mistake do n't waste your money on this game	4
0	i got this game because i thought it would be fun i was totally wrong ! every customer that i got brought only rabbits rabbits rabbits rabbits ! ! ! this game confused me a lot also it gets very boring and it 's very hard to control do n't waste your money on this game ! it will be a total waste of your money believe me	4
0	after being greeted with much excitement this program would n't properly install on my not so fussy computer the web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back very disappointing	4
0	i made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself i went online and purchased the program downloaded and installed on my pc installation worked perfectly i ran a scan and it even found viruses that mcafee missed however any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load after closing web browsers i have to restart before my pc recovers i unistalled the program and now everything works great i'm shopping somewhere else for my antivirus needs	4
0	i 'd give this no stars but it wo n't let me why would anyone buy this \? i was in compusa today as they are closing down on long island thought about buying this i put it down said i will researh this more at home as i suspected you can go to do the same thing that this software does the software does n't allow you to print stamps at home so what 's the point \? the only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps so it 's like buying a coupon that 's a one time use i do n't get it	4
0	i brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking it has very limited graphics and templates to workwith i would not recomend this software package also the journaling sucks as well even when you start a product from scratch the software is n't user friendly with very little guidence as stated before 1 star is to much	4
0	complete waste of money i purchased my copy at wal mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake i did the graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful the actaul program is so not like that the graphics are down right cheesy and low budget having only paid 9 for this program i feel like i was completely ripped off i 'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item	4
0	this software is a waste of money to say the least the templates on this software are terrible and ugly you are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from if you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it you have to format everything please do n't make the same mistake i made do not buy this product	4
0	if you read the license you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print certainly ca n't sell them and ca n't let others copy them unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission you probably do n't want this software	4
0	this program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts it is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic the word bubble sdo not rotate so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to it looks really great on the cover of the cd and that 's what sold me it was a disapointing christmas	4
0	this is very bad doesnot work and really interfers with other programs almost impossible to remove it	4
0	i could be home in bed but i'm fing around trying to undo the install of the biggest mistake i 've made to date purchasing tossing money in the toilet for nero7 the damage and the time it 's taken to recover is about 20 times it 's cost useless i ca n't copy a disk i ca n't burn and image what 's the deal \? \? \? all the negative stuff i 've read true unfortunately after i paid for nero7 before reading what others have to say what really puzzles me is who all the folks are that are writing all the wonderful reviews \? employees of ahead \? keep your distance or you 'll be sorry	4
0	nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating iso files and instead wants you to use its nrg cd backup file system then it does n't want you to burn wav onto cd but forces you to invest in mp3 encryption so that you can burn mp3 to cd the software is full of these horrible twists that nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want i rolled back to nero 5 5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again	4
0	this software suite promises to do everything on earth but does n't tell us how there is no useful help file there are no tutorials or instructions on the website and nero 's support is a joke \( just try to get a message through \) i do n't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this	4
0	this product is worse than useless right off the bat the tutorials do not behave as depicted what is left does not run properly i spent hours and hours trying to make a cd from an lp all to no avail to make matters worse this bug infested monstrosity has very poor support there is no 800 number the version that i had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless ! after the 10 days technical assistance costs 1 29 a minute plus the cost of the long distance call ! i repeat ! do not buy this product !	4
0	ever since adobe bought out this small operation customer service has been severely lacking software will not work on excel 2007 the promise for additional powerlooks has become dead granted that the program makes presentation more interesting the powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website this is highly disappointing as i purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the powerlook templates	4
0	i use powerpoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations unfortunately every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work for now it sits on my shelf until i can purchase more powerful equipment certainly not for the casual user it is n't the magic black box that will make you a star	4
0	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual	4
0	i am an experienced office user i recently updgraded from office 2003 \( which worked great \) to office 2007 and now i am much less productive office 2007 is pretty but if you actually have to get something done at work don't buy this product	4
0	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4
0	i have always used norton antivirus and had no problems with it at all i have recently had to migrate to outlook 2003 and norton is 2005 and have non stop system crashes i have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of norton professional and hey presto everything is working again and not talking two hours to load	4
0	quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for intuit products and services in my opinion it is fine to offer additional services to customers but give the customer the opportunity to say no thanks and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity	4
0	from my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station they say may i put you on hold while i check my resources then they read answers off their screen several times i had to say to the tech i ca n't understand your english if you buy the package i 'd find a local qb certified accountant and pay him her for their time	4
0	the res on the artwork here is less than miserable the interface is high tech circa 1996 i'm dissappointed in this purchase i would have thought it was fantastic when i bought my first pc in 1993	4
0	i 've installed and tested this for several clients whether backing up to a local hd or over the network the system has worked i install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore and it 's always worked i did have trouble once windows froze up this was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient ram it worked the second time i do n't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2 5 stars annoying amazon 'feature' ! since 60 of windows pcs are malware infected i'm figuring most windows pc support issues are malware induced	4
0	it 's a piece of junk so save your money and some headaches even dell technicians ca n't fix it my new dell computer had norton ghost pre installed with a back up hard drive just for cloning it sounded like a perfect setup except my norton ghost would n't work contacted dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with norton to no avail now i'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me	4
0	i bought this product to assist in recovery but i tried to recover a program and it would not work does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial works well on recovery of my stuff	4
0	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about 6 months of 'trying' to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	4
0	this cd should be priced at 5 00 the graphics will not keep your child 's attention and it 's pretty lame it was a wasted purchase i have to bribe my child to use it because it so boring	4
0	i bought this for my two sons ages 6 and 8 to help them develop speed with their memory math skills what a disappointment even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed i wish i 'd purchased a different product	4
0	this concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible my 7 year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse and we could n't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game and playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels and did they actually test this thing on humans \? what a waste of potential it is a good concept	4
0	my son had an earlier version of math blaster it was wonderful i saw this new version and expected more of the same wrong ! ! after 10 minutes of loud sounds and pulsing video he was complaining it was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff never could get to a point where learning might take place wish i could get my money back after this disaster we purchased mia 's math adventure this was more in tune with the first math blaster	4
0	i just got a 2006 version of math blasters i played it for a while and i thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all ! i think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing ! the box it came in said it was for age 6 12 but i think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids i really dont think this is a good game to play	4
0	this is the best selling bible in america for good reason ! ease of comprehension lovely modern english pleasing packaging and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation read i was a teenage jehovah's witness and jehovah unmasked for two of the wildest rides ever !	4
0	if i could give it 0 star i would my humble opinion is that kaspersky is not better than norton at slowing down your computer one brand new computer plenty of space and memory one old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well each time kaspersky updates i ca n't open outlook express nor explorer well the programs do open actually but i have time to vacuum and dust before they 're launched i used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement samwis	4
0	based on lots of great reviews i decided to buy kaspersky after two months i got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted i sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key this did not work i had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply this time no one ever replied i sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still weeks later have not replied i emphatically advise against buying this product if you ever have a problem you will not get help	4
0	at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great recently however many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre loaded suite on new machines users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages \( e g ms office \) the word processor in works for instance does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch scandinavian turkish romanized russian japanese etc in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway	4
0	i had to upgrade to ms works 7 0 due to y2k issues i am not nearly as satisfied with ms wortks 7 0 as i was with ms works 4 5 i am now searching for a replacement	4
0	unfortunately i had to return the product because it was defective the first disk failed to load to my computer i contacted punch technical staff and they were unable to help me with the problem i tried on another computer in the house and the same thing happened i therefore returned the product	4
0	my daughter and another second grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow the controls are not very logical and there is no animation to speak of	4
0	the new systemworks has a horrible interface you ca n't see what your options are easily you ca n't see the status of your components you ca n't see what version you have when you load it after loading norton personal firewall 2006 the firewall will not load program rules \( you have to uninstall the firewall and then reinstall it \) i'm not sure how the protection works but the software redesign was done by an ergonomic moron	4
0	i have used system works on my computer since 2000 the 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones they have deleted many of the real diagnostic features \( registry optomizer \) dummed down the rest and added \( rather forced \) an auto load norton protection center that takes over the windows security center and cannot be easily unloaded software should be made to be user friendly this version is nothing like the previous ones	4
0	the software installation is buggy it try 's to download the entire installation from the snapstream web site even though there is a installation disk included if your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall windows i have windows xp sp2 with a flakey internet connection although i am computer literate after two attempts to install this product i have chucked the whole thing out the window p s snapstream has no tech service department to speak of	4
0	after 25 years of building pc and installing software beta testing software i am unable even with adobe 's technical support staff to install acrobat version 8 software gets to the end of the install process and stalls no combination of repair uninstall reinstall registry cleaning advice from three technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem using xp with all the latest upgrades defragging the drives with 2 mb ram and a adobe tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software	4

0	i have been unable to get the software to work on my dell computer with windows xp although i have been in contact with the technical team at sbt on many occasions my initial problem has never been resolved i am unable to use the test improve your memory software	4
0	sorry i liked the idea but this product did not meet my expectations it did not engage the users the interface was 20th century the technologies used were outdated my advice is to look elsewhere	4
0	i cannot believe that taxcut can no longer import capital gains info from fidelity which is has been able to do for several years i was a happy customer now i'm a mad customer	4
0	after spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non functioning suggestions i was still unable to install this on either of my pcs they do n't want to admit it but their ad for deduction pro kills the software install at 21 \( or 26 for the standard version \) and no their font patch killing all startup services upgrading the flash player nor starting in safe mode did not resolve the problem i'm out the money on this and am switching to turbotax h r block has lost this customer	4
0	i just input all the information for my return and this software has me owing over 8000 by my calculations i'm owed a refund of 150 200 it is not taking federal income tax already paid from annuities into account back to the calculator for me	4
0	i just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer when i got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains i could n't figure out how to import the data from fidelity that i 've done for the last few years looking around on the fidelity website i can across the following statement for the 2005 tax year fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into h r block 's taxcut programs h r block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year unfortunately this is the reason i'm using a software tax prep program looks like it 's back to turbotax	4
0	you can get mac os x for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the microsoft 's 227 dollar home premium which is the low end buy mac and get all the functionality in one os when spec'ed out the system are comparable in price except apple does n't offer low end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive	4
0	the upgrade is 75 cheaper and you don't need to have a previous install of windows to get it to work simply do the following 1 boot with the windows vista upgrade dvd 2 click install now 3 do not enter a product key when prompted 4 when prompted select the vista product edition that you do have 6 install vista normally 7 once the install is complete restart the dvd based setup from within windows vista perform an in place upgrade 8 enter your product key when prompted this is according to microsoft 's internal documentation and reported by paul thurrott at windows it pro	4
0	i was a private beta tester for the new os i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it if you depend on stability for your existing software you are out of luck the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista you are better off upgrading to a mac after all microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers	4
0	i hate this product since i'm used to office 2003 \( at work \) opening this program and having to look at the childish looking menu bar was a shock the layout is irritating poorly designed and does not provide sufficient features to make things worse this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to cd the one star rating was too generous	4
0	you do n't need to be a student or to own your home to get the home and student version any one can get that version microsoft does n't enforce the student part and by home they mean where you live	4
0	my best rating for microsoft money deluxe is it is pure junk do n't was your money if it works at all trust it is not with microsoft vista a class action law suit sounds in order for this garbage	4
0	i have been using this program for five years now and i'm finally going to switch to quicken the 'invoice designer' is a total waste of time it just has n't worked for years and microsoft will do nothing to get it to work this is the unwanted step child of microsoft so please do n't waist your time	4
0	terrible product confusing not easy to use like mcafee not meant for a basic computer user	4
0	buyer beware if you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund you 're out of luck they will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund there are many other good products out there that do the same thing it 's really easy to purchase but impossible to get a refund	4
0	unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments this is not always practical the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product but not yet ready for prime time	4
0	do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20 30 days of the shipping date \( the receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days \) you do n't have much time to return an item and the company does not give any leeway for christmas orders i am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room and i ca n't exchange it for another item because he did n't like any of their products	4

0	i have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess they are also both very computer savy i bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy but they say they find it boring and do n't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces the characters are very difficult to identify and confusing they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes i 'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club	4

0	the problem with this game starts with the introductury movie it develops slowly goes on forever suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play once game play finally does start my child found the games boring and the transitions between the games tediously slow cute characters zero edutainment it was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day	4
0	i guess i'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children this game has an enormous amount of story it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television interaction is confusing and frustrating i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation which is top notch i just would n't classify this as a learning game	4
0	the retail price is totally wrong i could get it for cheaper from another vendor	4
0	cakewalk s advertisement saying something like no experience needed to operate this software is in my mind mis leading at least and a down right lie at most i 've had it now for about three weeks work on it most days usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it and still cant get anything out of it all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work blues pop country so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen beware unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed	4

0	this product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the virtual pc and no number 1 as a result i was not able to install vpc which was one of the reasons i purchased this overly expensive product the office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the office x that i had so it is both an aggravation and a rip off	4
0	i purchased the upgrade since i 'd already bought both office v x and virtual pc 6 1 last year the biggest letdown is that microsoft 's promised support for the g5 is nearly non existent i have a dual processor g5 with an ati radeon 9800 card \( apple \) and after trying to install virtual pc 7 three times i cannot get a vm to work it did install \( and work \) flawlessly on my g4 powerbook googling for reviews finds it 's very hit or miss but if \( when \) it misses you 'll regret investing the extra in an immature product	4
0	this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless	4
0	we may never know if we like this product as the amazon box was empty when it arrived we have had no help from amazon compusa nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls this was my son 's christmas present and he 's still waiting at this rate we 'll end up with the opinion that we should n't order software online	4
0	darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games to make a commercial quality game in this language would be lunacy basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease and the darkbasic renderer looks very very ugly however basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with if you 're trying to get into serious game development learn c and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math	4
0	this program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit but if you want to make games in a snap spring for the professional and get a level editor on a darkbasic website	4
0	i got this as a present about two years ago and i have had mixed feelings i like it but i get really frustrated because the program is buggy i cannot create a standalone executable and the program has random bugs also it is very hard to create proffesional type games be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card regardless of whether you use it or not in conclusion good idea but very buggy	4
0	thought the cards would be like broderbund 's american gretings creatacard platinum 8 software but it was not and i did not like what i got	4

0	i have used turbo tax for as long as i can remember i have always purchased their business and their personal tax products generally i had been satisfied however this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months it corrupted all but 2kb of data and ca n't even open that of course you ca n't get a person via telephone or email i would give them o stars if that was an option so long intuit	4
0	if you have used the online version in the past stick with it buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax almost as if two separate companies ! plus the user interface on this software stinks bigtime very hard to navigate back and forth online version is actually better \( though i did n't try it this year \) does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users \? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues	4
0	since tax cut decided not to produce a mac version this year i got stuck with turbo tax their website promises that one may import data from the previous year 's tax cut return then you buy the thing and you find out that it requires you to load the turbo tax program and your 2004 tax cut data onto a windows machine transfer there then load it back onto the mac for this to work so like a chump i borrowed a friend 's windows machine and did all this but it does n't work not at all and it takes a lot of time to find that out tried every workaround i could think of nope it does n't work	4
0	after purchasing this product i found there were several problems with scanning i contacted nuance \( who purchased scansoft \) to ask for assistance from technical support however i then learned they want 9 95 for each incident when a request is made by email not by phone by email after putting out a great deal of money for this product i should not have to pay 9 95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product i regret that amazon does not allow me to give this product 0 stars	4
0	i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version 14 and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version 14 and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base	4
0	if you spend a good deal of your time doing ocr on books skip this program it is even slower than the previous version \( which was tortoise like \) still screws up the order of columns is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters takes forever to move through long documents and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4 oh and do n't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms it will take you less time to create it from scratch in word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors i'm switching to kurzweil	4
0	i purchased this item from amazon the disc had scratches and was unable to either use it or get my money back these items can not be returned	4
0	be careful if you buy this version of symantec antivirus for handhelds it will not work with microsoft mobile 2005 supposedly symantec antivirus for handhelds version 3 5 will work with mobile 2005	4
0	this software never worked after installation using the cd i bought it ask me to extend my preview your preview using this feature has expired to continue using purchase the full version today i have tried to contact the seller in vain this is very unfortunite for such people to continue hacking customers money with under rated product	4
0	this software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs but if you want to make exciting slideshows this software is very basic and not user friendly i had technical problems from the start you are better off using ms powerpoint than this software	4
0	this product is extremely difficult to learn i recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning	4
0	i received the bundle but there is no installation key for shade le i noticed the someone else 's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so i figured i 'd post it again	4
0	buy it here and save s ! shipping cost from the uk added 46 95 to the price and a foreign debit card transaction fee of 2 51 for a waste of 49 46 that could have been spent getting additional models or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4 practical poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing poser 6 development	4
0	taxcut did not warn me that i needed to fill out additional forms required for taking the exemption for a qualified child nor did it lead me through the schedule c like turbotax does turbotax may be more expensive but it 's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused if you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations \( or prefer an intuitive program rather than something that makes you say what am i supposed to do next \? \? \? \) stick with turbotax	4
0	this program has a bug in processing 1099 r data that makes the whole software package useless to me after filling in the data from my 2005 1099 r form the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005 and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return i could not find a way overide this problem also there was no apparent way to directly contact h r block to find out how to fix it after wasting a couple of hours i now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo tax which from prior years experience is relatively bug free	4
0	unfortunately this application includes only a mac os 9 \( not the mac os x as advertised \) version i cannot review the cds in general as i cannot run them why did they re publish the 1998 software in 2006 again in mac os 9 \? frustrating	4
0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
0	this is the worst thing i have ever bought i bought it because i am having some trouble in spanish in school i bought it thinking that if i gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa but all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word so save your self 20 dollars and do n't buy thi	4
0	although this dictionary 's contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there 's no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan	4
0	i have been using frontpage since 1997 i am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program ! but ! i have only upgraded to frontpage 2000 and find that with my xp computer win xp does not support frontpage now if i want to continue with my family genealogy site and a community genealogical society site i will need to purchase and learn another program at age 70 i really do n't feel like doing that ! does anyone know if fp 2003 will work on win xp \? or how can i get my fp 2000 to work on my win xp computer \?	4
0	have tried about six times to install it i 've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice all to no avail it says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings it tells you to check the log well there are over 85k entries and even if i found the errors i do n't see any way to correct the errors when i try to run it i get starter mfc application has encountered a problem and needs to close i 'll be returning this puppy to amazon for a replacement	4
0	i am underwhelmed with the dvd rom from britannica it ia a waste of timeand money their main object is to sell britannica with snatches to createinterest these dvd roms should be sent free to arouse interest i now owntwo dvds and both are unsatisfactory	4
0	eb own words unfortunately at this time the britannica software is not compatible with windows vista we are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on windows vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the vista compatible software but it is entirely possible that we will not have windows vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software they do not offer a reasonable on line subscription	4
0	intuit charges banks extra to support mac users and many banks do n't pay so the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on quicken mac several other features are lagging behind the windows version and for some inexplicable reason transferring data between quicken for windows and quicken for mac is n't complete or straightfoward i have n't used competing products but for mac users i recommend either running the windows quicken version \( using boot camp or parallels \) or buying another product and by all means let intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers	4
1	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
1	simply the best software out there for digital photographers graphic designers and anything having to do with digital image creation and manipulation packed with features for novices to professional advanced users the only limits are your imagination	4
1	adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user there is however a plethora of texts tutorials learning guides and even video 's to help abate the learning curve	4
1	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route it was obviously worth it everything arrived perfectly wrapped up original cd set etc shipped in record time as well eyal	4
1	the product is easy to use like how it intergrates with ms office applications it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	4
1	this is a good inexpensive gps system it does a good job of tracking your location the map is excellent the labeling is not as good as the previous version poi finder is top notch	4
1	its a great gps once its starts and detects the satellites \( sometimes it can take up to 5 mins \) i used it with iguidance and that software is the whole world of difference i can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the gps unit \( robotic sounds need to subtitle that for me please ! \)	4
1	this is my first experience with gps this product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions viewing the screen on a laptop as opposed to most of the portable gps units is a definite advantage to the user i would purchase another immediately if the need arose	4
1	it does everything i hoped for and more ! ! as a new user of acrobate i am very definitely impressed in part by the ease with which i am able to learn the program as well as its functionality !	4
1	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds i am sure this one will too	4
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
1	these are a favorite in the home even though we have all of them they are each different and provide hours of entertainment skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals great source of fun and learning also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game	4
1	i really enjoy the nancy drew games they can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done the check list continues to update as you move through the game i look forward to each new game as it comes out and ca n't leave the computer until they are done	4
1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
1	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly	4
1	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations i also have the reg plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine	4
1	the product has very good themes and screen savers some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future	4
1	product came in a timely manner and i love it easy to use and fun too	4
1	extremely helpful and superior graphics and choices to change your computers them	4
1	this is an easy product to use it saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space it will grab it from another hard drive it is also useful in setting up a d drive for documents and and e drive for programs it is useful to have windows on c alone there are fewer crashes michael common	4
1	it 's a useful tool combined with another norton 's products ghost you can easily perform pc maintanence using these tools	4
1	it has some nice upgrades from version 6 it is quicker than the previous version highlighting text is a bit easier it caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports but i found a patch for the officejet and all is well it is a product that is helpful in my work	4
1	the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel and is more user friendly i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print some functionality as before with some new organization and better look feel	4
1	after using 7 0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7 0	4
1	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5	4
1	i upgraded from version 5 i do n't use very many of the features but the big difference i see is files sizes seem to be greatly reduced something i would scan and be 10mb now might be 2mb this is just opinion nothing scientific the interface takes some getting used to a bit different overall for the price \( 99 less 20 rebate \) a great deal	4
1	i find that the new version 7 of adobe acrobat loads faster than version 5 both stand alone and within my internet browser also the new version is better integrated with the browser and with microsoft office i believe adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6 there are many other features which i have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile kudos for what i see as a substantial improvement i recommend	4
1	i have tried a few other photo editing products but i always come back to adobe easy to use and excellent results	4
1	the software does a lot of great things you can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks the system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that it is great software	4
1	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great i have elements 4 and can see it got better	4
1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
1	works fine like several other office packages lacks database program access	4
1	my daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use also she likes the research tools that it provides and it 's easy to use it 's very practical she uses it a lot	4
1	this program does what it says it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program	4
1	ms office student and teacher edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes office documents and presentations school work and projects correspondences scrapbooks pictures etc truly a great addition to your computer software	4
1	i bought this for my 3 children who are already taking computer classes in middle school the license allows you to install it on 3 computers so for 130 its a great deal considering that a single license of a full version of office is couple hundred	4
1	i have been running windows xp sp2 and would never want to go back to windows me or windows 98 with the xp i rarely need to re boot my system and my pc no longer freezes up there is a built in windows firewall plus a pop up blocker which are both awesome the system is much safer and i have never had a virus worm or trojan horse while running the windows xp home with a good internet security virus program one thing make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your pc before starting to download as this does require at least that get it ! you wo n't be disappointed	4
1	absolutely the easiest upgrade of a microsoft os that i 've ever done as a retired hardware engineer i 've done a lot in the past it 's one sweet os	4
1	worked as expected a few hardware glitches but that was to be expected	4
1	this was used to upgrade my operating system at work it went fairly well actually much better than i had hoped	4
1	simple it loads like a blaze sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat but the speed of 7 0 alone makes it worth every dime especially if your current acrobat is the half baked clunky 6 0 x that burst through the gates before it had legs	4
1	i have been using v 7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it it loads very fast \( unlike all other adobe versions \) the conversion to pdf from doc or ppt files also is much quicker i have not encountered any problems yet but its only been 7 days since i am using it definitely worth the upgrade	4
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
1	great sw easy to learn and good graphics really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3d could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously \( e g windows doors cabinets to get all with the same materials colors hardware rather than one at a time very labor intensive \) should warn users to select create a style and then copy paste them where needed also difficult \( maybe impossible because i have n't figured out how to do it \) to change a room 's house 's overall style once you start a given design	4
1	this package is very complete and easy to use took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts et a lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	4
1	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems it is too expensive but it is the standard at so many companies big and small around the world i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general the price is a bit high but windows is what it is a dominant operating system	4
1	i do not why the others had these problems with windows xp i have run this program since it came out 2001 \? except for the danger of attack by viruses i have had no trouble as long as enough ram is installed a minimum of 500 750 is essential with the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2 i feel fairly secure	4
1	this is an all around awesome product i have had great experiences with the program and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school 's yearbook anyone one who says it does n't have the basics is pretty much lying to you it has anything you 'll ever need and more the people who review this product poorly do so because they do n't know how to use everything in it the only problem i 've ever had is learing everything you can do with it otherwise it is perfect	4
1	this product is so good i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's make disk copies and archive data files i'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product i'm very happy with this item the price is very pleasing as well	4
1	this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd 's it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth it 's great wish i would have had this years ago	4
1	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	4
1	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times i always shoot with nikon raw format it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10 15 minutes	4
1	the service was good and it came undamaged and the product was easy to use and it has been very satisfactory for my needs the description of the product was accurate	4
1	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4
1	this program does exactly as i expect i am very pleased	4
1	i had a very old version of hallmark studio do n't even remember how old wanted to update i installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features lots of cards to choose from very very pretty colors the event planner is great too ! the only thing i would change is the ability change font in the planner and move written info by tabbing otherwise it 's a wonderful program highly recommended ! ! satisfie	4
1	i buy a lot of cards and they are always hallmartk because i there quality is wonderful the kit is of the same high quality it also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures it was one of the best things i ever bought and i know i well use it a lot	4
1	purchased for my mom to use and she loves it she says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people if she 's happy with it so am i	4
1	i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also keep making more and more thank	4
1	this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful installation is self explanatory this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse pointer over various portions of the graphics if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results this is the one to get with the cost of cards being what it is this program will pay for itself very quickly relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized i recommend this program highly	4
1	i am teaching myself japanese i want to learn more languages i learned german french and korean i want to learn korean because i have a friend who speaks korean this software is very awesome ! ! ! this can really help students who are taking french or spanish to get a good review if you find a language you want to learn from this software good luck with your studies and have fun	4
1	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x men all the older along with the newer issues look great the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x men \( 1 461 \) along with giant sized and annual issues there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute could it of had more content maybe but this will keep one busy for a long time with easy maneuverabiltity this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment	4
1	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4
1	this is a great collection to get if you would like to read the comic 's from the past at a great price	4
1	i could n't have found a better x men product every mag has its own pdf the readability is only limited by the size of your monitor	4
1	all i have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars or about 40 years worth that 's like a dollar a year you do the math it 's an amazing deal also quality is great and you can print them if you want	4
1	i loved the x men cartoon in the 90s and fox and always liked reading the graphic novels in barnes and noble and the like however i just never had the time or money to get into it like i wanted this collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years reading the first 60 issues was a trip seeing how the characters were developed both the art and their literary personality if you 're interested in the x men whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart for 40 bucks you can know it all \( almost \)	4
1	while i love the content and the overall idea it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging all you get outside of the outer box is a cd in a paper envelope no jewel case book insert etc perhaps it 's on the cd	4
1	this new version of illustrator is great glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool	4
1	i was waiting for cs2 after using the cs there are too many problems in cs and i am very happy with cs2 now the software is a lot easier to use less problems i have been using illustrator since illustrator 4 cs2 is definitly better than ever !	4
1	not bad however in version 10 was able to use cntrl to zoom in used the on the number pad now this function does n't work and the only that works is that in the top row of the keyboard the zoom out in the number pad still works but not the plus i say that 's not good why ruin things with an upgrade	4
1	as one who is not an accountant i found quickbooks premier non profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn read the books that come with the software before you dive in	4
1	maybe i'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product to accomplish the reports that i need i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose so it gets the report done just not as nicely as i had hoped tracking work is made incredibly simple rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	4
1	i 've been using studio for years and while i definitely had reliability problems with studio 10 0 10 6 has been very reliable and beta testing 10 7 shows me it is just getting better i tried premiere elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things and it was much slower burning a simple dvd image and it simply does n't do hd which i 've started playing with i'm sticking with studio and i make a dvd just about every week with my kids' videos i do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean	4
1	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events i do have one warning however provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use my wildest expectations were exceeded	4
1	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels just a matter of display preference so it 's not that important to every user	4

1	having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks any help will be appreciated kroh	4
1	i am not a computer person but found this to be easy easy easy	4
1	excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it highly recommended	4
1	i loved the experience especially with the smart picks smart templates smart search and smart rank i recommend it to any user very happy with the product ! thanks eisenworld thanks alohabob	4
1	i am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side this purchase has paid for itself over and over now that i do n't have to run to someone else for art it was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images i guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images i did and i love this product ! ! ! !	4
1	good for those looking for a vector collection not so good for those looking for photo clip art as photos are high res at 200 dpi i suppose the photos are useful to an extent but the usefulness is limited by size i was looking for vector art so i am satisfied	4
1	i 've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and i finally broke down and bought it very pleased with everything included lots of stuff to use and not just cheezy clip art lots of boarders symbols brush strokes etc the bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc \( disc 3 was actually disc 30 \) one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked	4
1	i run the after school program at the local jr high where i work we try to push the importance of computer skills on the children i just upgraded to the 800 000 clip art library we use these images for just about every project i have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it ! ! !	4
1	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good solid game play an interesting mystery and intriguing characters a chance to interact with aquatic life i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio it was so much fun the puzzles were a good mix of ability levels and types word puzzles spatial puzzles problem solving ones i can completely recommend this game	4
1	i had a lot of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more nancy drew products it was interesting and i could n't wait to solve the mystery ! i enjoyed myself a lot !	4
1	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
1	i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations i also have the reg plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine	4
1	the product has very good themes and screen savers some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future	4
1	product came in a timely manner and i love it easy to use and fun too	4
1	not a complicated application but it successfully repartitioned a 100g drive into 3rds on a new lenovo laptop with xp sp2 i would recommend using the dos version which you can get just by booting on the cd requires no install you can simply boot make the changes and it is done seems to be very straightforward and i would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with windows running	4
1	i installed a wd 320g usb drive to use as a backup drive i used the hd backup software to do auto backups unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and i could not use it as you would a normal drive \( drag n drop \) or access a particular file i used partition magic to reclaim my usb drive and in the process i partitioned the drive the drive now works as i want it to i have control ! partition magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job	4
1	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
1	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements	4
1	i still have a lot of learning to do but just what i 've been able to do with photos the last 2 weeks is amazing i do n't know why i waited so long to buy this thing	4
1	adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user there is however a plethora of texts tutorials learning guides and even video 's to help abate the learning curve	4
1	i have fireworks corel paint and now cs2 to choose from perhaps it 's my familiarity with photoshop that makes me so partial to it but i feel it 's the best imagery software on the market i upgraded to this from ps7 so i missed out on cs but from what i can tell this is the smoothest running version yet i 've not encountered any problems with system or support i guess everyone 's experience is different but this is great software and the vanishing point feature is just brilliant	4
1	the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel and is more user friendly i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print some functionality as before with some new organization and better look feel	4
1	after using 7 0 for a few weeks i find that this is the best yet the speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous i highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7 0	4
1	i love this adobe product it works very well for me only a couple of minor glitches it keeps asking me to re register but that 's only a minor annoyance overall it is a very good product	4
1	version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5	4
1	the software does a lot of great things you can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks the system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that it is great software	4
1	i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great i have elements 4 and can see it got better	4
1	even if one could afford the full photoshop cs or cs2 elements has it all for the photo enthusiast elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation quick fix and standard edit the browser is adequate though i 've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos many of the features of the full program can be found in elements like layers plug ins for effects and a variety of adjustmens with a little patience and experimenting as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you 'll be surprised how creative you can be this program does not have the learning curve of the full photoshop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer	4
1	with plenty of opportunity to be creative the only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet all in all though i would highly recommend this software	4
1	help ! this program will not let me print all of my address 's unto christmas labels when you go down to the arrow to check all address 's it will not move any help would be appreciated thank	4
1	this suite of applications is excellent they run much faster on my mac than even the equivalent mac programs i love them and use them quite happily every single day a great value for students and teachers	4
1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
1	works fine like several other office packages lacks database program access	4
1	love this product i like having these microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios	4
1	this program does what it says it does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program	4
1	ms office student and teacher edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes office documents and presentations school work and projects correspondences scrapbooks pictures etc truly a great addition to your computer software	4
1	absolutely the easiest upgrade of a microsoft os that i 've ever done as a retired hardware engineer i 've done a lot in the past it 's one sweet os	4
1	i followed all instructions before i attempted to do an upgrade from windows me to windows xp infact the more i read the more i was told to do a clean upgrade so i did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and i got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth i love what it gave me clean upgrade means a clean start you remove everything and start with a new program	4
1	this was used to upgrade my operating system at work it went fairly well actually much better than i had hoped	4
1	i have been using v 7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it it loads very fast \( unlike all other adobe versions \) the conversion to pdf from doc or ppt files also is much quicker i have not encountered any problems yet but its only been 7 days since i am using it definitely worth the upgrade	4
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
1	i was afraid at first not to order directly from adobe but decided to take the cheaper route it was obviously worth it everything arrived perfectly wrapped up original cd set etc shipped in record time as well eyal	4
1	i feel home designer suite 6 is a good value for the price it obviously is not a full blown pro program which i think many people expect however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning it is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual or on the provided cd	4
1	this package is very complete and easy to use took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts et a lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	4
1	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems it is too expensive but it is the standard at so many companies big and small around the world i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general the price is a bit high but windows is what it is a dominant operating system	4
1	the product is easy to use like how it intergrates with ms office applications it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	4
1	i have viewed pdf files for years never made one before the installation was simple and converting word excel or other files to pdf is one click away only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied	4
1	i'm a longtime mac user and for re naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iview media pro is the best i really like the feature that let 's you produce and publish on line galleries of your images without any code or html experience using only a very simpe interface and you 're ready to go for the full time photographer or amateur i highly recomend it	4
1	this is an all around awesome product i have had great experiences with the program and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school 's yearbook anyone one who says it does n't have the basics is pretty much lying to you it has anything you 'll ever need and more the people who review this product poorly do so because they do n't know how to use everything in it the only problem i 've ever had is learing everything you can do with it otherwise it is perfect	4
1	this product is so good i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's make disk copies and archive data files i'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product i'm very happy with this item the price is very pleasing as well	4
1	this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd 's it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth it 's great wish i would have had this years ago	4
1	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	4
1	i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times i always shoot with nikon raw format it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10 15 minutes	4
1	i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds i am sure this one will too	4
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
1	i liked how you could go underwater and try to find things i also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for minette and yourself i did n't like how the tea was so hard though i could n't figure it out but finally i got it i liked that you had to fight minette too it was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face over all danger by design was a fun game	4
1	i really enjoy the nancy drew games they can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done the check list continues to update as you move through the game i look forward to each new game as it comes out and ca n't leave the computer until they are done	4
1	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4
1	this program does exactly as i expect i am very pleased	4
1	i buy a lot of cards and they are always hallmartk because i there quality is wonderful the kit is of the same high quality it also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures it was one of the best things i ever bought and i know i well use it a lot	4
1	purchased for my mom to use and she loves it she says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people if she 's happy with it so am i	4
1	i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also keep making more and more thank	4
1	this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful installation is self explanatory this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse pointer over various portions of the graphics if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results this is the one to get with the cost of cards being what it is this program will pay for itself very quickly relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized i recommend this program highly	4
1	i rate this 5 stars based on my knowledge of the fantastic four and x men complete editions i'm writing this review to warn people about my receiving 2 defective copies of the spider man version from amazon i 'll have to try a 3rd time	4
1	this is a great item for any collector or new fans to the x men all the older along with the newer issues look great the cd includes all issues of the uncanny x men \( 1 461 \) along with giant sized and annual issues there is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the xaiver institute could it of had more content maybe but this will keep one busy for a long time with easy maneuverabiltity this is a highly addictive cd with virtually months of entertainment	4
1	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4
1	i could n't have found a better x men product every mag has its own pdf the readability is only limited by the size of your monitor	4
1	all i have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars or about 40 years worth that 's like a dollar a year you do the math it 's an amazing deal also quality is great and you can print them if you want	4
1	this new version of illustrator is great glad i upgraded ! the live trace feature is cool	4
1	i was waiting for cs2 after using the cs there are too many problems in cs and i am very happy with cs2 now the software is a lot easier to use less problems i have been using illustrator since illustrator 4 cs2 is definitly better than ever !	4
1	not bad however in version 10 was able to use cntrl to zoom in used the on the number pad now this function does n't work and the only that works is that in the top row of the keyboard the zoom out in the number pad still works but not the plus i say that 's not good why ruin things with an upgrade	4
1	as one who is not an accountant i found quickbooks premier non profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn read the books that come with the software before you dive in	4
1	maybe i'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product to accomplish the reports that i need i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose so it gets the report done just not as nicely as i had hoped tracking work is made incredibly simple rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	4
1	i have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product i have created numerous videos of my children 's escapades and sporting events i do have one warning however provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen the software is extremely intuitive and easy to use my wildest expectations were exceeded	4
1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
1	i have read several reviews and decided the spyder2pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me i have a samsung 970p monitor with all adjustments via software the calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process i like the spyder2pro and would recommend it highly	4
1	i installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and i find that it gives me wonderful protection i would recommend this product to everyone i am very satisfied i feel my computer is very well protected	4
1	i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels just a matter of display preference so it 's not that important to every user	4
1	this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai	4
1	it is wondeful software simple easy to use user friendly and very accurate in the pronunciation buy this cd do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam webster 's website also try the medical dictionary it is as equally superb	4
1	this is my first experience with gps this product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions viewing the screen on a laptop as opposed to most of the portable gps units is a definite advantage to the user i would purchase another immediately if the need arose	4
1	i have a question about this i'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it is that possible on this program \? cause my friend has acid pro 4 0 and that is really awesome but it 's like 400 and i dont have that kinda money wut i liked about acid pro 4 0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that so im wondering if you can do that on this program if u have an answer for me e mail me at peepilott aol com	4
1	this one is definately the best out of all of the previous acid music programs it has a ton of loops a really cool looking skin and much more options than in acid 1 0 or 2 0 it comes with two cds one of them has the application on it with some loops and the other cd has nothing but loops and demo songs ! it has over 1 600 unique loops ! definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous acid musics	4
1	having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks any help will be appreciated kroh	4
1	this is a good package for backing up your pc fairly intuitive although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup the downside of that is you ca n't just select a file to restore you must go through the restore process you can select a single file but it takes a bit of time runs automatically and unobtrusively so it wo n't interfere with your current work	4
1	i am not a computer person but found this to be easy easy easy	4
1	excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it highly recommended	4
1	i loved the experience especially with the smart picks smart templates smart search and smart rank i recommend it to any user very happy with the product ! thanks eisenworld thanks alohabob	4
1	this is unbelievable it can tell the importance of the stuff on my pc and i also can set a weekly backup task on my pc this is fantastic it is so straigh forward and easy to use i will definately recommend this product to everyone i know well done alohabob ! ! !	4
1	good for those looking for a vector collection not so good for those looking for photo clip art as photos are high res at 200 dpi i suppose the photos are useful to an extent but the usefulness is limited by size i was looking for vector art so i am satisfied	4
1	i 've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and i finally broke down and bought it very pleased with everything included lots of stuff to use and not just cheezy clip art lots of boarders symbols brush strokes etc the bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc \( disc 3 was actually disc 30 \) one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked	4
1	i am so pleased with this purchase ! ! under normal circumstances if i spend anything over 1 00 i get caught in a spiral of buyers regret this is a feeling that i have grown accustomed to when i received the 800 000 through the mail i shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images i could play with i was astonished ! then i realized something or rather a lack of something i felt no remorse for buying this ! i finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages labels calendars scrapbooks and everything else i wanted to do	4
1	great program but the fact that you ca n't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by alaire	4
1	this was a wonderful game ! hours of good solid game play an interesting mystery and intriguing characters a chance to interact with aquatic life i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio it was so much fun the puzzles were a good mix of ability levels and types word puzzles spatial puzzles problem solving ones i can completely recommend this game	4
1	i had a lot of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more nancy drew products it was interesting and i could n't wait to solve the mystery ! i enjoyed myself a lot !	4
1	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
1	this has been a good purchase for us we are in northern italy for about 7 weeks and needed to navigate a number of cities for several business meetings and just to find our way around it has been an invaluable tool we have still used physical maps to a certain extent but in finding the shortest routes and other points of interest this has helped us never to be lost \( so far !	4
1	i'm planning a trip to europe \( of course \) and it help a lot with millageand since i plan on using my gps from my streets and trip then i figure that everything is gonna be a o	4
1	going to europe this spring and needed this software to plan stops etc on our three week trek this is excellant as is their usa software	4
1	i'm planning a motorcylce trip in italy this summer and the program gives me all the info i need on routes and sites of intertest along the way overall a great product	4
1	if you have used ms streets trips then you 'll know your way around autoroute we are using this to plan a trip to europe next may based on my knowledge of locations in britian the software appears to be pretty accurate if you want to use this with a gps that does not come bundled with the package expect some frustration i still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my usb based garmin unit i think it is possible just do not know how	4
1	easy to install and get started i purchased it to manage my digital photo 's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing it 's been easy to use for my purposes if you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation do more homework on the robustness of this product i ca n't comment on it 's capabilities for that purpose	4
1	i love this product i had a sample version of it prior to that expired and i needed to have the full edition it came in a timely fashion as well i am very pleased	4
1	this is a very extensive volume of expert advice on how to use windows xp and so far i have found it helpful although a bit too technical that is not compatible with my xp	4
1	i have used the hallmark card studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version i like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two	4
1	i have the older version which was great but does n't seem to work on win xp both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card big plus the graphics are nice and there are many choices it 's a good deal at the price	4
1	i think this program is fantastic i have used it many times so far and have gotten many great compliments	4
1	very easy to use and provides a very wide range of cards and other items excellent product dav	4
1	i checked around before making this purchase and amazon had the best price for print shop i love it i 've used it for a couple of projects and i have no complaints it 's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs	4
1	i have been using various versions of print shop for years i am very impressed with the number of new inovations of this new versioon of print sho	4
1	learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base however i have taken about 5 years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic and while catalan differs in many ways many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it overall great for beginners and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge	4
1	av materials for catalan are very difficult to find but catalan is certainly worth investigating and this makes for a highly pleasant intro now if only eurotalk would come up with a second cd	4
1	remember this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment ! pro 's easy to install somewhat intuitive to use up and running in no time imports digital video fairly simply speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer stability of program is strong point does what it says it can do did n't make any coaster on first attempts to use finish product runs well on all dvd players con 's needs more style templates needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations	4
1	i 've only just begun using this software but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow i would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials i find the tutorial confusing so far i have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the help section but it just is n't as straight forward as i would have liked i purchased this b c it was rated so high by pc magazine i'm sure in time i 'll learn the software better but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware i have taught myself to use	4
1	simple and great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user i would say it is the beginner to intermediate user tool i can really create fast movies very quickly pros easy to installeasy to split edit home videoscompatible with ilinksupport for high definition hdv camcorderscompetitive pricecons user interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows rendering is slow	4
1	definitely worth the money for example excel is a great program it is pretty easy to use and not too hard to figure out you can add up figures in a snap this product provides a great service to companies because of the usefulness of this software	4
1	thanks for office i bought a new h p desktop that only had a 60 day office trial and literally had to pay the price thanks to you i'm glad i did n't have to pay full retail installed like a charm downloading sure has gotten a heck of a lot smoother bless your hearts	4
1	as prommised new in box shipped immediately excellent price good service and good first experience	4
1	i received micrsoft office 2003 in excellant condition the box was sealed and in good condition the 2003 office software is easy to use if you have used any of the previous versions many new features make it worthwhile to upgrade	4
1	the price was the best i could find ordering was hassle free and delivery was fast	4
1	i have used synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them however do n't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after your current subscription runs out because synmatec will not give you credit for the un used portion of your previous subscription i asked and they said no way that aspect of customer service is very disappointing	4
1	i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers it helped me see just what we wanted	4
1	i love this product but i wish i could see all floors put together as completed home in 3d view	4
1	not for the professional but gets the job done for the most part	4
1	i have not spent tons of time working with the program yet but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate it has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished if you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features it performs as promised	4
1	was a fan of nortons till after reading reviews and going onsite to check out this anti virus package it just has more to offer and less of a resource hog	4
1	impressed with the way it clears out viruses spyware and trojans i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it that all goes well what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign me in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	4
1	i am not a computer geek or techie at all most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers i recently purchased the kaspersky anti virus based on the review of it in consumers reports it installed easily updates automatically and frequently very satisfied with it	4
1	i have got a virus that cause files comment htt appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus i tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective so i try kav and it works ! also kav does not slow my computer like some big named antivirus autoupdate feature is cool we do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable	4
1	i run two websites using this program easy learning curve i recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple workable program ignore the crittics this is a nice program only wish in batch editing i could do multiple web page saves	4
1	i like all the things you can do with this product glad i purchased it	4
1	i highly recommend microsoft digitial image suite 10 and the free gimp programs for all of your digital imaging needs ! ! ! \( \) dis 10 should be out now	4
1	i have been using pc cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple	4
1	i was using ca but they dropped zone alarm and i was having issues pc cillin has my computer safe again i love that it is 3 user	4
1	no brainer easy to use good value	4
1	my feelings are if you have simple income not a lot of financial dealings this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty i 've only done fed state with 2 incomes 1 home with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything using the program is a snap and it saves me about 200 300 over using a tax preparer who asks me questions just like this program does you simply need to sort out all your receipts etc the same as you need to do for a live preparer	4
1	i read several reviews and was little hesitant to purchase this software i have a basic hp all in one printer and so far the software is wonderful and easy to use i have really saved some time with this software	4
1	produc in good condition easy to use best price comparing it whit other selling companies	4
1	i needed this for my new macbook laptop that will give me apple and windows on the same machine the laptop works fine the pocketbook is thinner you do what you have to do	4
1	bought this primarily for my tivo set so i could transfer and burn dvd 's from my tivo box once i hooked up my mac g5 to the tivo box toast worked perfectly easy interface fast transfer easy to burn it 's nice to know that tivo supports mac a great product ! !	4
1	i love toast and have had it since version 3 do n't have tivo so ca n't comment on usability but for everything else it works better than software that comes with mac ca n't wait to try double density and blu ray with which this is compatible even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the mac a friend of mine just switched from pc to mac and this was the first software that i suggested he buy as another reviewer said if you have toast you do n't need popcorn the best ! !	4
1	i was a little leary about purchasing this product having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world i was delighted to find how easily the toast 8 system worked for me the owner 's manual is very specific and while i am still discovering all the capabilities of this software i have found it to be extremely useful i recommend this product very highly	4
1	i am very excited about the additions to toast 8 i am still learning how to use all of them the connection with tivo is one of the most exciting new items i have connected and reviewed tivo recordings through toast i have not had an opportunity to use toast for a dvd yet	4
1	the product works pretty much as advertised and i received it in a fairly timely manner	4
1	this product is great it is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording the addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner the only problem i have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd if you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need do n't wast time with anything else	4
1	this world renown editor is the best when it comes to editing and managing your digital photo	4
1	i purchased elements because frankly i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada i have found it to be pretty intuitive lots and lots of options as to organization photo tweaking and such i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos i do have two other imaging programs and with the addition of elements i feel like i'm basically well set with zillions of options plus there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples such as textures and so on very helpful get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program you will not be disappointed	4
1	i used adobe 3 0 for a long time and love it took the opportunity to upgrade and love the same things about 5 0 it 's easy to use easy to learn great to use for just basic printing easy to get more complicated if you want	4
1	i found turbotax easy to use it gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process since i am an experienced tax preparer i found this feature welcome	4
1	i 've been manually doing my taxes for the last few years they were n't hard as much as time consuming turbo tax turned an all day project into just a couple of hour	4
1	good product however i do n't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time i open the program perhaps they should try to get it right the first time and it 's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me using it with quicken is a pita it is unclear to me how you get more than one state	4
1	this is a great program for your mac i 've used it in a film class the previous year and it took me a year to really get the hang of it because it has no tutorial i recomend you find someone who has used this and get them to give you a few lessons	4
1	i found wordperfect to be much more intuitive than microsoft office the reveal codes function has really eased many formating headaches and i love the automatic pdf maker	4
1	i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave not available in word i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12 like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12 i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12 if an earlier version is working for you i see no good reason to upgrade b	4
1	i installed it on three of my computers with no problem i have used wordperfect before and it 's vey user friendly i'm not a power user but the basic things seen be easier to do i recomended the software came with and intructional dvd no how to used un like the microsoft counter part this software is more then what is needed for the average person it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers it come with lots of template that you can used buy buy buy i say lol is worth it	4
1	i 've been using wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better it is the best word processor by far so many things are better than microsoft 's word processors importing graphics mail labels and especially reveal codes to name a few	4
1	the new edition of w p is simply the best the new features the little extras you 've come to expect from w p the user friendly tool bars all make this a good investment	4
1	i find ms 's expression web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from frontpage frontpage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers but the code view really was n't much better than notepad \( not that i have a problem with notepad ! \) i highly recommend it for the professional web designer	4
1	a good product but like a lot of microsoft releases not everyone outside of microsoft is ready for it check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with expression web that is a problem i have run into in fact some hosting services that support front page have n't even come to full support of front page 2003 let alone expression web you could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features	4
1	great product ! i have had a little experience with frontpage but this product is definitely not frontpage with a new look this is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development it goes way beyond my abilities if microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started then watch out dreamweaver	4
1	compared to frontpage and its infamous bots expressions web is a refreshing piece of software from microsoft that out dreamweavers dreamweaver as a long time dreamweaver user the ability to easily stay in design mode in expressions web while building your user interface without the incredible futz factor that dreamweaver imposes is its greatest strength this is a very impressive stable product that i plan to use a great deal in my non net web development work it makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever	4
1	i have been using frontpage 2003 and decided that web expression web was the next stage in my website building hobby it was easy to install and i can still use frontpage 2003 on my existing websites no need for frontpage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts i use also bought using microsoft expression web by jim cheshire an excellent book still have much to learn but looks like fun	4
1	i had the software in just a couple days and it was exactly as i ordered along with it came an information sheet on what to do and who to contact if there were any problems great job would order from them again	4
1	the only problem that i had was loading the actual program on the three computers that i have you had to delete your old norton antivirus 2006 before starting also i have one more problem that after i loaded the norton antivirus 2007 3 users on the last computer i still get a error that i need to down load the latest updates which i already did	4
1	the product did just what i wanted and that is to burn videos onto dvds from my camera i had an earlier version of nero but it would not do this	4
1	i previously had nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me i upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer to vista premium and i was pleasantly surprised everything i have tried so far has been flawless it seems that different systems have different results with nero for example some people say nero 6 works best for them but on my old system it was horrible \( running on win2k \) it 's complicated software though so people should give nero a break overall they do a great job just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system	4
1	great product has more features then just cd dvd burning system backup numerous audio recording editing features lightscribe and it 's also vista compatible the only downside is it 's learning curve some features and options are complex but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product	4
1	i used this unit to calibrate my mitsubishi wd65732 dlp hd tv and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment i first went through the tv manual to make sure i understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so i could study them and make sure i knew how the language related to the spydertv adjustment language once i did that and marked down the adjustment ranges it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments it even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising but the bottom line is that the picture looks great	4
1	this thing is amazing my plasma is like a whole new tv my 60 sony sxrd paired with a ps3 is the best looking picture i have ever seen after using the stv100 this is a must have	4
1	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4
1	you learn extremely fast using rosetta stone and you learn to think about what the word is not it 's translation probably the best language system available	4
1	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program my ear is now tuned to the language i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses my vocabulary still needs to get stronger but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french that is only a matter of practice with the language as advertised this program is painless and progress is rapid try the demo you 'll see	4
1	i discovered my ms office had a bug in it and came that way from the factroy i looked word over and it was clean then the program itself it does everything and well and it does it without the tracking bug on it	4
1	i purchased this program about 1 5 years ago i have been casually studying german through other programs for about 4 years the best basic words only is through unforgettable languages \( very basic but easy as heck to learn \) rosetta stone is the best for understanding gender verb usage and adapting to the german style of sentence structure i absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program it is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking the only negative is that the cd has to be used to run the program even with an accelerated cd rom the starting stopping of the cd is distracting if that feature were corrected it would be perfect	4
1	overall i was pleased with ease of installation this was an upgrade from office 2003 i backed up all files before upgrade and always do this but it was not necessary for this upgrade my overall disappointment is outlook 's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers \( yahoo gmail etc \) the shift appears to favor msn products only \( hotmail and msn \) no wonder thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application	4
1	i upgraded form office 2000 to office 2007 expecting to see major improvements i was disappointed office 2007 has some enhancements but it also has some glitches if i had been able to try it first i probably would have just stuck with my old version of office	4
1	i notice with gratitude that symantec has removed many glitches from nav installation is now faster and smoother the program is running well in the background updating itself and sending notifications of any attention it needs	4
1	this is a great product it easily performs all the functions a small business needs if it is to be taken seriously in the marketplace i'm impressed at how seamless it integrates all the accounting functions essentially you never enter information more than once and it always anticipates the most logical next step my clients are impressed at receiving e mailed estimates and invoices that are clear timely and professional this is a must	4
1	quickbooks is an incredible product if you have never used it before try having someone walk you through it	4
1	i find this product easy to implement train users and monitor manage any small business	4
1	this software is perfect for what i needed it allows my to keep my books without relying on an accountant	4
1	you will save a lot of time by using this ocr top notch accuracy and very easy to use a must for all those who need an ocr do n't hesitate	4
1	sept 15th 2005i bought this for my god daughter after buying mia 's science adventure i have never been so impressed with a companies product before you can learn both spanish and french on the same cd the graphics are amazing the adventure is stupendous and now lily \( my god daughter \) is learning spanish her level is above all her classmates and she 's even started conversing with a mexican girl in our neighbourhood well worth your money	4
1	this game is great ! after buying mia reading i thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning spanish since we live in a global village they game was easy to load easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners the high quality 3d animation will blow you away even my husband who learned 3d animation at the vancouver film school was blown away the best part is that they love playing it as they think it is a game they forget they 're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences well recommended	4
1	i have been using nsw 2006 for a year and it 's never failed me i 've always used symantec products and have always been satisfied	4
1	i have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training cd that is included with the program very easy to learn great item 3 23 07 i have used this program every day and must say i love it i have used other photo editing software and did not like them much this is so easy to use the training cd gets you started and after compleing it \( 7 chapters \) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed a powerful program you can look like a pro using this 10 stars if i could	4
1	an excellent item saved me lots of time and money	4
1	it is user friendly transparent and more robust than trendmicro 's or ca 's products both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working for windows oses onecare is best in my experience however i have not used onecare 's backup feature enough to make a judgement the 49 99 for 3 computers may be okay but it would be even better if microsoft offers it for one computer at 1 3 the rate say at 17 computer per year	4
1	silent and reliable protection at a bargain price simple interface not like those other fragmented bundles of freeware utilities	4
1	i am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it i will buy it because it does n't eat my memory and i feel safe with the people who designed the operating system i reccomend	4
1	wow this really made a difference in my ability to create professional looking comics i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is really good i think my favorite feature is the tool for making panels plus the tool for doing special effects lines which is pretty sweet i just draw comics for fun and for this price it is totally worth it manga studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings i would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga	4
1	this unit works well the software is a little hinky it does not explain when to attach the spyder but if you keep going back you can figure it out other than that i am satisfied	4
1	excellent for the novice i callibrated three monitors with the spider prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other after i was amazed how close the images were to each other the process is so simple that even a cave man could do it	4
1	i love this product it is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from	4
1	creating keepsakes scrapbook designer version 2 deluxe this seems to be a nice program but i have not found much use for it as of yet my intention when buying it was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards i am sure that i will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate broederbund products are usually very user friendly	4
1	for anybody who needs the full power of acrobat this is the way to go highly recommende	4
1	product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition	4
1	i 've been using acrobat pro since version 3 0 this is by far the best user interface of any version also like the new tool to combine multiple files into a single pdf no support for office 2007 docs yet but i understand from adobe there will be a free patch soon	4
1	works well most \( 95 \) of the time slight improvement over v8	4
1	i'm an old school comic book collectors and i bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page this is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art and i still find there 's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages	4
1	it 's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal in print format it would be impossible for most people to own let alone store this much comic book history you have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen rather than holding it in your hands \( a large monitor helps \) but other than that i highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics to be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times whether they be in the 60 's 70 's or more recent years really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture	4
1	the content gives you 40 years of comic reading for a fraction of the price however some of the years ca n't be opened tried contacting the seller but to no avail	4
1	it is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again i read them as a kid but did n't get to read the very beginning i hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on dvd i will buy more	4
1	we bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year 's old sun to learn how to play because i did n't know how to play and i could n't teach him as a result of this purchase1 \) my sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that i could n't imagine2 \) i \( his mom \) learned how to play too it is so much fun to learn it that i would recommend it to anybody it worth it every penny i spent i like everything about this game kids will love it 100	4
1	i am a chess player myself so i can endorse this even more this software is well designed it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it but kids can figure it out eventually my son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes \) but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe	4
1	seem's to work very wellcost was acceptablenot a resource ho	4
1	registry mechanic is a great registry tool it works better than the registry tools included with symantec system works if you purchase this version at 5 1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6 0 once you register the product try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance	4
1	okay for the time being but not enough needs to be combined with system mechanic for optimum capacit	4
1	registry mechanic by pc tools is an absolute must for managing one of the gray areas of windows easy to use immediate boost in speed great price a must have 5 stars fdr	4
1	i bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great ! my screen broke on my nokia 6102 and i ended up buying a razor i had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes also the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone	4
1	i have been using tax cut for five years it is quite easy to use and generally well documented i would like to see a better ability to select individual forms for printing	4
1	the software is easy to install and easy to use the import prior year 's return feature saved time in completing multiple returns i completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature i also discovered the save as pdf feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom i prepare returns i have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year the premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules	4
1	have used taxcut for years and this version does not disappoint the import of previous year data worked well and my tax return was quickly prepared	4
1	this study bible is absolutely wonderful if you are ready to dig deeper you could literally spend hours on a single chapte	4
1	notice you need at least 2gb ram not 1gb and vista it is for you !	4
1	this is a well done operating system i use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems all my hardware has 64bit drivers overall this is a good product and i would buy it again because i went from a 32bit o s to a 64bit o s i had to boot from the dvd to install it but i was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did i have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do	4
1	aside from the typical minor quarks this is overall a good product i 've been using turbo tax for many years and it seems to work for me	4
1	solid familiar and dependable although i wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview	4
1	this is a pretty good product for the price ! i 've found a few errors on location of addresses but all in all pretty good ! just wish microsoft will offer a commercial vehicle version sometime in the near future so far we 've had no complaints	4
1	i use microsoft streets and trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime i'm traveling to a destination where i'm not absolutely certain how to get there in general i'm pleased with it 's performance it has saved me from wrong turns many times however the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions gps tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant off route back on route messages as you navigate twists and turns i suspect in that case the map data is just not that accurate	4
1	i 've been using streets trips for years i'm a real estate broker and use it every day great product not as up to date as yahoo maps but easier and faster to use particularly the route planner gps live local links etc	4
1	this is still the best one out there but this new version \( been getting yearly updates since 1998 \) adds very little finally updated a couple streets in our area so that alone was worth it	4
1	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	4
1	ca n't say enough for it there is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all i 've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up they have been consistrantly excelant	4
1	i 've been a photoshop user since version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny i upgraded from version 7 and cs2 is clearly a step up upgrading was a no brainer the only negative is adobe bridge i prefer the file browser that ps 7 had but i can live with it the floating image windows is also a nice touch you are no longer confined to the ps main window all of my add ons worked perfectly including fits liberator and the ptlens suite	4
1	this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop 5 5 no problems at all this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop 5 5 this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2 rather than purchasing cs2 outright be sure to get the updates after you install the program	4
1	i 've used adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so	4
1	i upgraded from photoshop 7 to cs2 and have never looked back no problems what so ever and many new features that really make it worth the purchase	4
1	great improvement in photoshop technology i 've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography it 's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking aligning and combining	4
1	easy tax preparation and lots of information videos and help i even bought stock in intuit because i also use their quicken product awsome products no wonder microsoft had their eye on it before	4
1	i am very happy with this turbotax after my son showed me how to use it i was hooked in the past i have always done my own income tax and every year it becomes more difficult my wife is an independent contractor and by using this software it made doing taxes a breeze and fun	4
1	i am a single mom and have never done my taxes by myself the cost to have taxes done is ridiculous this is the best thing ever it walks you thru everything and is very easy to use i will buy this product again next year	4
1	i seriously do n't get why people are having problems installing and using windows vista i had no problems installing it and no problems using it it runs smoothly and responsively no problems current specs 3 0ghz intel pentium 4 ht 800fsb 1mb l2 cache1 5gb ddr pc3200 667mhz ram200gb sata 7200rpm 8mb cache256mb ati radeon x600realtek integrated hd audiointel 915g motherboard22 viewsonic vx2235wm hd digital monitor 1680x1050optical drive 1 dvd rw dloptical drive 2 dvd romno problemo	4
1	this is a very good racing simulator ! but it 's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you ! it will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars you 're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game graphics are very good but the race car physics and handling are exceptional highly recommended for racing sim fans not recommended for the casual race game player	4
1	this is the most technically excellent racing sim i have played the physics are perfect the graphics are pleasing and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars the learning curve can be very steep but you can adjust the ai to suit your needs you can also turn on traction control steering aids etc which will get you into the game faster after a couple months you 'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven there is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing if you want a realistic racer buy this game	4
1	bought this after thoroughly enjoying gt legends if you want to experience the best driving sim on the market buy gtr2 while i love rally sprints nascar and most other driving games this one sits on the pole complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane graphics rock get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel pedal combo as well how good is it \? i 've had it several months and i still say it is the best there is semper fi	4
1	this software is very easy to use i use a logitech nascar racing wheel together this game is great	4
1	this 'game' is awesome if you like sims do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once ina while 'playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track \( it is very different from taking the family car for a spin \) i got it with my logitech g25 \( an awesome ffb wheel \) i think thesetwo were made for each other	4
1	i 've been using this product for awhile and i'm delighted with it i got my algebra i homework done in 1 5 the time it usually takes me ! in addition to this when i feel like learning i watch some of the discovery channel videos that are included with this even better is that this product comes with a reducing its overall price to today i'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay i love microsoft student with encarta premium 2007 and you will too ! buy it ! trust me you won't be disappointed	4
1	i purchased this program simply for the encarta 2007 i was amazed at all of the wonderful features that microsoft put into the package i feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life enjoy it	4
1	i wish the reviewer had stated whether ms office 2003 small business edition satisfies the requirement pending clarification i 'll stick with encarta 2006 despite its less \( than 2005 version \) user friendly search page encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and i'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars	4
1	great product takes some thought but once you learn it its great	4
1	i would recommend premiere elements over any other video editing software i 've used it can do much more than other programs and it is fairly simple	4
1	this is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films	4
1	taxcut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes i have used it over the past several years updates are easy to download and the software is great this year the software arrived on a usb key this is the easiest and best way to obtain the software small easy to store and is reusable i will continue to use taxcut in the future	4
1	h r block 2006 works well like it always has i 've used and liked h r since the turbotax activation debacle to the extent that i can like doing income tax ! what is great is the media the software comes on install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday with piles of used drives in a box but for now it 's a super handy way to store and move a few files 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive no matter the price it right	4

1	everything i need to file my fed and state taxes i did not expect the deduction pro to be included pleasely surprised i have used taxcut for a few years now i like the import of previous year tax data \( less typing \) it seems h r has an online version it would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version oh well maybe next year	4

1	this product is very superior over prior versions it plays back your text in your own voice my accuracy has improved in dragon naturallyspeaking 9 over other previous versions i have used having been familiar with prior programs voice to text it was easy to implement it was a good investment the product came promptly and with no hassles	4
1	i was a norton user for a long time i think this is a better program lighter leaner easier to use it automatically updates frequently i 've never had a virus i use wireless and i can always tell if someone is trying to use my system \( which is never but i 've tried to break in myself just to check \) nice program	4
1	i have always used norton products for antivirus for the previous 12 months i had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time i turned on my computer \( a royal pain ! \) at renewal time i looked around and found pc cillin software was highly recommended i bought it and loaded it easily since i'm not very computer savy it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings it works well i miss a couple of norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click but updates load by themselves and i 've had no problems	4
1	i purchased this software for my brother to use for his daily reports he works for a police department and the old documents transferred over quickly and easily	4
1	i became a committed user of onenote in its orginal version in 2003 the new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product 's functionality i use onenote as a depository for research information collection i can create any number of notebooks and subdivide each into any number of sections and subsections which allows me to put information where i want it i recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give onenote a try	4
1	this is a fantastic product it has endless applications i absolutly love it	4
1	i 've been using onenote since it was first released the 2007 release is the most effective writing note taking information organizing tool i 've ever seen data can be exchanged with other ms office programs easily it can be used with tablet p c s desktops and laptops information can be organized by notebook section and page \( great for students to keep their notes organized efficiently \) it is a great way to keep research notes cut and paste exerpts etc this is quite possibly the most useful piece of software on the market	4
1	i made the mistake of ordering this product and microsoft office 2007 which i did n't realize that it was also offered in office 2007 which i did n't need 2 of them so i gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the	4
1	i 've been a onenote user from the original release \( onenote 2003 \) and this version improves on an already exceptional product organize your life using this one application and never go back to paper again	4
1	i enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find encarta a useful tool i'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events	4
1	i enjoy using encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information i use it in conjunction with britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information i do prefer the interface and ease to britannica 2007 but the quality of information on britannica is always to be trusted my advice you need to buy both	4
1	kudos microsoft my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly the new interface is quite simple but very powerful it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics if you have not tried encarta in a while check it out there is much to like	4
1	this is a wonderful and very useful program not only for school age kids but also for adults it is full of useful information it comes very handy when you want to learn about anything look for any topic you will find it there	4
1	encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta 2007it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks like the newest videos recommend at least 1 gb of ram and a pentium 4 processor with a newer video card \( 2 yrs or better \) for the best video viewingit will run on older system	4
1	this was by far a great program and never had a problem with it loading on our computer fast installation and very easy to work with plenty of available online over the phone or program tutorial help ! awesome program even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers	4
1	purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday reason \? my computer was moving much slower than it used to mcafee scans my computer everyday and does n't find anything yet it was fully updated i had a feeling it was n't working when i installed this thing i scanned it right away this is what it found viruses 67spyware 312adware 51after the scan everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again i am very pleased with panda 's software and will purchase again if needed	4
1	i really liked this version of office it makes formatting and other tasks like making tables inserting bullets and the likes much easier i have not done any work on excel 07 yet so i ca n't give any feedback about it	4
1	the product came well packaged and unopened i really needed instructions on how to open the packaging but once i got it opened and installed the product works as well as promised the set up and ribbon menu is a lot more user friendly than 2003 i downloaded the trial version that microsoft had offered and i must say that this is the best office product offered by microsoft to date	4
1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	4
1	zonealarm by checkpoint is one the best programs for protecting yourself it is better than norton internet suite	4
1	all in all a fine product has gotten excellent reviews from pc mag norton slowed my machine to a crawl this has not suggest never paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to i 've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up it does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web for a non techie this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage	4
1	i have had all the anti virus programs and zone alarm works best e fiel	4
1	this is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc i 've used mcafee it drove me nuts i 've used norton also drove me nuts zonealarm worked nearly flawlessly \( as well as windows can \) it is a very stable and intuitive program that is what i have been looking for all i can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you 're using now especially if it 's mcafee or norton just a sidenote i run avg free antivirus alongside this and i also ran it alongside norton and mcafee avg would catch things that neither norton nor mcafee would never have had that problem with zonealarm	4
1	i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook g4 1 5 my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer before tiger my computer would hang when playing large dv files \( such as the ones i made in imovie \) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same this tiger upgrade does n't include some of the apps \( games quicken etc \) that my wife has on her new macbook but it did include a 30 day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy	4
1	what can i say other than this is simply hands down the best operating system on the planet ! we were spoiled by how flawless it performed and sold our pc soon afterward	4
1	why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer while this os is not the top of the line today it was when i bought it if you buy the mac it pays to have the best operating system stay current the hardest jump was from os 8 to os 9 i was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me now it is seamless like they say just plug n play	4
1	everything was perfect until i used expos the animation was a little choppy but that probably has more to do with using an ibook g3 than with tiger	4
1	i found it hard to work with and was disappointed that it was n't more versatile my needs are not quite the same as a standard business however and i have friends with businesses who like this very much	4
1	it has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy invoices in a flash keep track of your expenses so easily this program was the best investment and tax deductible ! very easy not complicated !	4
1	before buying quickbooks you should google quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition this free version never times out you can immediately download 400m or get the cd with no shipping charge the big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs	4
1	super simple to install and easy to use this program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money i created a personal account company it does n't have to be for small business only but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future the price was just right for our purpose	4
1	very satisfied easy to load and very easy to use i started using it as soon as i loaded it with out reading the help or tutorial i really like the ease of use and the quality of the invoices it produced i had quick books a few years ago and the new one is much more user friendly i highly recomend this program for anyone running a small business	4
1	great backup solution i install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it never fails have not done a restore yet but i would imagine it would be easy since i have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date also bought the software from a vendor that amazon recommends i do n't no why they do this but the software listed on amazon is 49 99 which is the right price i bought two from a vendor for 15 00 each wow what a savings and a great markup for me	4
1	all i needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my dell laptop so i got acronis true image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10 i put the new hard drive \( right off the sealed box \) into a usb caddy that i got on ebay for 6 plugged it into the usb port and ran acronis 9 selected the clone drive wizard and less than an hour later it was done no need to cross my fingers the new drive booted right up and i'm using it now to write this review what could be easier	4
1	i started with norton ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images acronis true image backup 9 0 has a simple user interface that works well i used it to re image my son 's computer without any problems it is a good product for the price i highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis	4
1	heard other poster said v10 has been available so searched and found it is true v10 is available at the maker 's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here btw i planed but have n't buy the product yet but i have to assign a star number in order to post this message	4
1	easy to install and navigate automatic incremental backups are completed randomly sometimes they work other times they abort ca n't determine why	4
1	july 27 2005why have n't i heard about the mia characters before \? i bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game we opened it together and i was blown away with the 3d animation the same quality as pixar everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game best of all its educational but because it was so entertaininng my god daughter has not stopped playing it well worth your money ! i'm going to buy the rest of the mia series	4
1	the software was installed flawlessly programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted	4
1	perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to but on the mac runs smoothly entourage is a fine email program and word excel and the others work great a little spendy but worth it if you need it entourage communicates well with oulook and has a similiar feel	4
1	kind of expensive but did n't come with my new laptop and i needed the word doc 's works awesome and i get to do power point with it i'm sure it will be easier to use than later models overall great product	4
1	very pleased with performance have used it before without problems	4
1	i am very happy with microsoft office 2004 it is easy to install the software i am using the whole suite of products successfully and easily thank you bill gates \( and steve jobs ! \) !	4
1	i recently purchased microsoft office and so far i have had the chance to use microsoft word i am familiar with the product as i have had the older version before with my old computer i was pleased to find that i had no trouble with using my old files with this new software i also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use i was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning i am also glad that it is n't very much different from the old version so i was able to use the program easily without much adjustment	4
1	it 's just packed with all kinds of goodies i highly reccomend it	4
1	purchased my dazzle recorder from amazon stocked items and found it to be just as advertised the dazzle performs as advertised and a very reliable method of recording movies it is very simple to install and operate i bought this dazzle for my daughter and now will order one for myself	4
1	this product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home vhs tapes onto dvd the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because i wish it supplied the connection cables with the product other than that i have no gripes worth the money in order to preserve your precious home videos	4
1	the quality is excellent ! use it to go out of the digital cable box strait into the computer pinnacle software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a dvd burner makes great menus i have bought and returned well over 5 rca capture devices and this is by far the best especially for 50 ! ! ! ! ! ! cant beat it	4
1	my boys are 5 and 7 and they can play this at different levels and enjoy it very much ! ! they have played it and learned from it extensively	4
1	i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills lastly you have to hit the f keys and esc to save and exit the game not many program make you do that today overall i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program	4
1	the mia series are great for our family the kids always look forward to playing their mia games they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy the two disc thing is confusing but really does n't interrupt play the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart so it 's not too big a deal	4
1	excellent software for kids it keeps my 5 year old challenged and comes with 4 different difficulty levels to choose from	4
1	great product i am in the graphic arts field and corel now works easier with adobe products	4
1	i bought this software for the graphics capabilities and my husband is using photo paint to edit our family pictures this is the first version of coreldraw i 've used and am very pleased with the help features find them intuitive and the whole package impressive	4
1	i use corel draw x3 everyday for designing logos signs for my sign company i can start from scratch and produce professional designs in a minimum amount of time this program offers a wide variety of editing tools great import exporting options photo editing and tracing options the more i use this program the more impressed i get	4
1	i 've been a corel user since ver 5 or so it 's always been a decent graphics application but ver 12 and now 3x are the best i 've ever seen this program is so intuitive compared to others in this category it s particularly easier than quarkxpress i know quark 's a page layout app but you can do the exact same stuff 95 of the time in corel much better pdf 's and a huge price advantage make this their best version yet indesign is also very good but pure useability gives corel an edge	4
1	i like this screensaver because you think the fish are really real and you can feed them and watch them and you tap on the glass your fish will sometimes react i'm going to keep it forever and ever the 2 expansion packs to complete my screensaver of fish is the arowana pack and the funstuff pack thank you for reading this cool review and my name is kris i really like aquazone	4
1	well its definetly improved version since the last one but they still have a lot of things to do the biggest problem is pages if text has specific symbols like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc forget it u 'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago either funky symbols or underline dashes keynote is much better but if u r a scientist and not a sales man both packages still have a lot of room for improvement however i'm still happy with this purchase because it 's apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future	4
1	i enjoy the aqua real 3d ! its enjoyable to have fish but its a lot of work to keep it up having this 3d virtual reality fish is fun and brings the enjoyment w out the work its very relaxing to watch the fish and to listen to the water even my cat watches the fish	4
1	my husband wanted an aquarium screensaver for christmas dumb gift i thought so i wanted to get him the best one online shopping made it easy to see my options and get him the best one for the best price he is very happy with it	4
1	i used the public beta of lightroom it was amazing i could n't wait for final releaseof it i ordered it helpful for photographers nondestructive editing high recommended	4
1	i 've only been using lightroom for a day but i was pleasantly surprised with the photoshop integration just hit cmd e and lightroom creates a copy of the photo \( with our without the changes you applied in lightroom \) for editing in photoshop format and groups that copy in a stack with the original as you save your changes in photoshop the image is updated in lightroom i felt that the workflow was very smooth	4
1	this is a great software for photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images i gave it a four because i would hope that adobe would still find ways to improve this product the functionality is superb and for such a great program it does n't eat too much memory on your computer \( i have a 4 year old pc with 768 mb of ram \) and because of this i'm shooting more pictures in raw format and not worry about the time i spend in front of the computer i 'll definitely be buying the next upgrade	4
1	within a couple days after installing dragon it showed a high degree of accuracy the accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate it was installed on a 2 7 celeron with 512 of memory the program generally keeps up quite well the program works with comcast and aol free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol com	4
1	the program seems to be much more accurate i am still learning but i feel it was a worthwhile investment i can write my e mail much faster now i highly recommend it and i feel it was worth the cost	4
1	i really enjoy this product and am sure that voice recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day it is very easy to load set up and use everything that i needed was in the box i speak with a slight accent and it still works so smoothly this is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports it is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next great for doing e mail all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish i love it !	4
1	i really like my new windows vista upgrade the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly infact i liked vista business so much i upgraded to the ultimate version both versions are very easy to install many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but honestly the bugs are n't a problem it is important to run the advisor about is your system ready for vista before you install to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista other than that everything else is a breeze use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it you 'll have lots of fun !	4
1	product has a nice clean interface i was able to load most drivers and application software without incident note upgrade install requirements are not clear microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that do n't help very much	4
1	great product just one downfall check whether your printer and other software hardware is compatible first i've had windows vista since it came out and my printer driver is still not compatible which means i had to purchase another printer in order for it to work	4
1	pc doctor works great ! it removed spyware that other software did not it is a memory hog and slows your computer while scanning but it is worth the time i turn off the software when not using the internet	4
1	yeah its great get rid of ur piece of doo doo windows operating system and pick yo self up dis ! aight piece yallz and remember once yo go mac ya neva go back	4
1	the upgrade went smoothly and tiger 10 4 6 appears to be as stable as 10 3	4
1	this is my second version upgrade it is very easy to use and i sought it out when upgrading my previous version love it	4
1	i am very pleased with the new 2007 hallmark card studio deluxe i have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs i am well satisfied i especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects i have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well it would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use i am pleased with the card selection verses and graphics for non professionals i believe you get more than a fair value for the price	4
1	we purchased this program on the recommendation of a friend because we have a 4 yr old grandson who 's very interested in art and is comfortable with computers turns out his older sister has the program in school kindergarten they both enjoy having this to play with when they visit	4
1	great product my child has autism spectrum disorder and this is a program that holds her interest she really likes the different music she can select and says some of it helps to calm her down i love it	4
1	i bought this program for my daughter for her birthday she wanted it because she 's used it at school \( 1st grade \) i was impressed by how easy it was to install i installed it as admin and she had no issues running it under her limited account \( xp pro \) i 've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program she even made valentine 's day cards for her whole class with it just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink	4
1	at the elementary school my children attend they have it on their computers so they were begging me to buy it for them its very user friendly even my 5 year old can play with it without assistance	4
1	good product but it 's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required	4
1	essential for microsoft office 2007 users running windows vista office 2007 already provides a pdf converter however it does not allow for security editing or markup pdf converter does and without the tech support hassles at adobe since my new hp computer came with adobe reader already installed in the vista environment i kept it as the default pdf reader and i use pdf converter professional for actual stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents pdf converter had a very easy custom install feature i disabled all microft office internet explorer and outlook add ins and i installed the product it all works together extremely well	4
1	excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use product well packaged arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition scansoft responded with an email in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it 's progress but you know rebates they take forever ! pdf converter 4 is not my only scansoft product i also use paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that my buying experience has always been positive with amazon com vendors never a problem john mc laughlindaytona beach florid	4
1	i have not used this product for very long and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category but i have so far been plaesantly surprised with the performance features the scansoft pdf converter pro 4 software seems to do all adobe can do \( and a little more \) at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of adobe pro 8 ! i'm happy with my purchase thus far !	4
1	this is one of the best graphics suites that i have ever used it is very user friendly and all the my students that i have used it have really liked it the toolbars are easy to find and the entire program is filled with outstanding graphics tools this is a must have for anyone who is serious about graphics	4
1	i am average when it comes to design but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it 's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it i like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background to get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already and there 's a lot i am missing i will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error	4
1	i have been a corel user for years this latest version is a great improvement esp for raster to vector tracing i have always preferred to use corel over our illustrator even though i have both installed on my system corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program very powerful for anyone from novice to pro user	4
1	i think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me it gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination create new personal things each time you work the only problem faced me was that it does n't support other languages but it works with wordart	4
1	i love this product i had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook this was so fast and easy also it only took a couple of weeks to complete i did n't over spend on paper tape glue and etc with three kids i do n't have the time to sit down and cut measure and more with all my pages completed i added a few things to go along with the theme of my page i even used left over christmas wrap to fill the 12x12 for christmas pictures theme	4
1	very easy to use lots of clips and templates loading glitch wo n't let disc 3 load have to use program with disc 3 in the cd tray otherwise very happy with the program	4
1	i bought this software for my wife for christmas the quality of this software is outstanding it is simple to use but has many many features i would recommend this software for anyone who likes to scrapbook but also for those who enjoy doing anything with pictures you can make calendars greeting cards birthday cards etc as well as flyers the price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it it is a must	4
1	among the various offerings available this is perhaps the most complete each offerings has some unique capabilities that others do n't possess but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops	4
1	it 's exactly what i wanted to buy complete collection of ultimate x men i do n't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture the ads were kind of annoying though i just hope marvel puts all the other x men series on cds like this	4
1	i had a hard time putting this one down i quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly i would recommend this to any x men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if i had the hardcopy versions my only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story ah well	4
1	this works fairly well for me it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money the interviews are fairly straightforward however there are a few areas \( like foreign tax credit \) where it should be automated but is n't but on the whole it does a nice job they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item	4
1	worked fine for standard items did not handle partnership issues completely would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed \( maybe this is possible but i did not find this function \) in general an easy straightforward program that gets the job done	4
1	got this game for my 12 year old and he loves it ! you need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded once it was installed it was a really wonderful game ! if you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out they will love it too	4
1	make sure you get the cheats to keep a lot of cash in the bank this game is totally addictive	4
1	took a couple of attempts to load this program on my laptop but once installed it 's more than i expected this is my first experience with gps and i'm impressed with how quickly and accurately the gps system locates my position and tracks my movement full featured mapping software and plenty of gps options make this an excellent value for my needs	4
1	purchased this to help navigate a trip from northern michigan to south west florida and back again we took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go there were a couple of times that we went off route but were back on route in very little time it helped us decide where to stop for fuel eat and sleep up to date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map viewing area was greatly appreciated well worth the price highly recommended to others	4
1	i do a lot of work out of town and in other states so i am constantly in unfamiliar or different places this gps has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that i used to spend looking for places i have recommended it to everyone that i have talked to it 's great i will never have to mapquest or ask for directions again another great microsoft product	4
1	this always was a microsoft good program who needs know how be and for where this is a good choic	4
1	connecting the cables was so easy i was sure i must have missed something recording the music is equally easy removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap my only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms i should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono you can not remove the crackle and pop	4
1	this product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to mp3 format on your computer or mp3 player you can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things there are other automatic features to shut off etc it also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients	4
1	i bought this to transfer lps to cd it is simple to connect to the computer and the software is easy to use just be sure when you download the mp3 encoding program to put it in the same directory as the lp ripper the lp recorder works well and is very easy to use the lp ripper makes it easy to trim the tracks and then encode them as mp3 files when saving them as mp3 's i can get approximately 20 lp 's on one cd i am very satisfied with the product	4
1	this product is very easy to install and use in couple of minutes i was able to set it up i used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well the reason i give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to dvd cd mp3 format	4
1	i received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks it is exactly as advertised it is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly i am amazed at the quality of the recordings i would definately recommend this product	4
1	i ordered the wrong spanish language learning sucess kit for my husband for christmas although he had taken off the outside wrap rosetta stone graciously allowed us to return the set i had given him and in return they sent us the version he had originally wanted rosetta stone made the return very easy and fast	4
1	i 've only just started but so far i am very pleased with this language program my only regret is that i do n't have enough time to keep at it the various learning modalities are quite useful this is the only program \( aside from taking a class \) that i 've used which does this i recommend it	4
1	i have windows vista home premium and i tryed four diferent antivirus from diferent companies and no one works well i have programs conflicts and lot of errors on my laptop and then i bought norton 360 and work wonderful this norton realy protects your computer and detected malicious internet pages is a good security for my lap and my privacy i'm happy and my laptop too now works just like when i boght it 2 mounths a g	4
1	streets and trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans we use it in conjunction with our garmin 2720 gps system and they are very complementary the garmin system does n't use downloads from the laptop and streets and trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home this is a very good program for trip planning	4
1	although i did not purchase this product from amazon com \( \) i absolutely love it the gps locator provided is amazing and better than i thought it was it is not one of those gps that updates your position every 20 seconds or something but when i zoomed in i could see my current location constantly moving on the map \( so it is updating every second \) i have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the gps provided to them is n't even this good i recommend this software and gps to anyone	4
1	i am very satisfied with this product since it does every thing that microsoft describes in their product description i am also happy with the price at amazon com since i saved about 30 of the advertised retail price	4
1	i travel a lot this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings i have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where i want to go it 's easy ! if i miss a turn the reroute from present position feature is great ! it takes a little getting used to but if you tend to be more visual or you do n't generally do well with maps or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you 're going ms streets and trips is tops	4
1	used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton mi \( in the u p \) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections \( lost signal a few times \) this works best when you have two people \( driver and navigator \) as looking over at a laptop while driving is n't a good thing ! would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would n't expect it	4
1	this is a cool game in a lot of ways i was jazzed about it because of the era it represents but the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting the huge disapointment however is this the online registration code is missing utterly missing and there is no resource available on the net to help the u s a help number is disconnected you will not be able to play online period the developer 's forums are full of posts about this problem no resolution beware demand more of the makers of the products you purchase this is extremely bad	4
1	simbin makes an excellent simulator this game has brought me back to days days of yesteryear in great delight the physics sounds and graphics are top notch the game is fun and the ranks seriously tough online capabilities are fine except you have to unlock cars and tracks through the game which could take weeks	4
1	this is no gtr but it should n't be either being a huge simbin fan i have to say the gtr series are still the best although there are times when gt legends historic cars can be quite the challenge and really a blast to drive and in the end thats what its all about	4
1	thats really my only complaint with this game every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same being in australia we had our own fast cars the falcon gtho phase 111 the hk monaro gts and who could forget the torana gtr xu1 ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the usa or england but they where supercars in their day that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik	4
1	this is the best version of office yet the differences are numerous and very significant it is well worth the investment !	4
1	a great new interface including control layout easier than ever to use and complete there is no other product in this class it looks great in xp and even sharper in vista subject to some agreement with adbobe you 'll have to download the free pdf writer from microsoft \( the beta came with it \) but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises the product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release \( less applications in the suite \) depending on your needs	4
1	i am a user of acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the disk director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use i partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so i know that you can but just have n't found out how yet it could have been made a little more simplier to use	4
1	the product does everything they claim save one it wo n't work inside windows xp \( service pack 2 \) but it will work when you boot from the disk that is n't a problem in my view therefore i have no complaints	4
1	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4
1	the item was received promptly and worked perfectly thanks for a great purchase bo	4
1	well if you are you will love this game ! i recommend it to anyone who loves the show ! fun game easy to use interface i say go get your copy now ! !	4

1	this dvd rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that i do n't know after watching every episode numerous times i highly recommend this for friends fans of all ages regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode also i love that the game can be played by only one person for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few friends to keep you company	4
1	i upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems the 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business the security however is not great for a mid sized company since my accountant fully supports the product they are always available for support	4
1	i have had mac for years and enjoyed using its functions i have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iweb sites plus i use it for syncing and backup etc i am not a power user however but it 's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily	4

1	i read horror storied about 7 0 nero so i upgraded to 6 6 from 5 5 by going to the amazon new used market this is a good program that does all you need for dvd 's and cd 's it gets good reviews i ca n't imagine what happened to 7 0 but they may have gotten carried away with user friendly ness i see a little of that in 6 6 compared to 5 5	4
1	6 6 ultra is an extremely good cd dvd burning suite it even has an excellent schedule able backup restore utility that burns to disk do not use the oem version it 's like diet nero and do not for any reason get nero 7 0 you have less than a 50 chance that it will work at all \( i am speaking from experience here !	4
1	how can doing taxes get any easier \? this is my fifth year using turbo tax and i think each year gets easier and faster i love the way my information from the previous year is brought forward and the ability to e file is just a click away i ca n't imagine using any other program	4
1	i bought finale songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols it worked well for my project i have no complaints	4
1	as a retired teacher i wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form finale songwriter does that the lyrics find their way to the correct note the midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software one of the attractions for me is the cost finale songwriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash try this program and you will find many facets hidden that makes finale songwriter a positive	4
1	word space for the other language is not work performed or designed for english ok ! work 's good	4
1	look notation software is notoriously expensive all musicians know that so when you see songwriter and its price it 's a relief everything you need is in this program i only have one complaint when adding an expressive dynamic \( p mp mf f ff etc \) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes it leaves an ugly looking score other than that this is the best deal on the market for what it is	4
1	i bought a 3 user zone alarm suite for far less than zone alarm offered for a single user upgrade it pays to shop around and amazon is often where it all winds up	4
1	i bought zonealarm internet security suite for the included zonealarm pro firewall \( it cost much less that way \) if i did n't already have norton antivirus i 'd use the antivirus too	4
1	i like the product and bought it after having the individual versions on a couple of pcs it was easy to setup and i love the feature set the vsmon exe file uses a lot of memory though and the pc seems to slow down some	4
1	with a per user price of 8 33 \( when priced at 24 99 for 3 users \) this is a wonderful deal and was just what my 6 computer office needed it was easy to install and appears to work well my staff loves the anti spam feature	4
1	some existing programs such as norton system works are not compatible with vista and norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version other than the compatibility issue windows vista home basic works fine for me larry leika	4
1	i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall \( zonealarm \) in my case that is the only negative i have found so far the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far	4
1	excellent service and the product worked extremely well the only criticism i would have is the cost of postage it was ridiculous the product came in a big parcel and inside was a dvd	4
1	i thought that i could never learn piano on my own all the material that i ever looked into either did n't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good because of this software i am constantly learning new things and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist if you are a beginner you want to buy this software it 's done wonders for me	4
1	great resource best parts are the chapters with the lessons on what the threats are and how they can specifically hurt you you ca n't protect yourself from something without knowing what it can do to you and how it works	4
1	i'm an amateur at website design building so understand that i'm not very deep in dreamweaver 's abilities however i got the program to switch from adobe golive cs2 which had many quirks bugs and frustrations \( one example while you upload your changed files to the web server in golive you ca n't do anything else in the program single tasking ! \? ! \? ! \) after just 30 minutes or so of working with dreamweaver to update my site i'm already sure i 've made the right decision ! i have a long way to go in learning what it can do but my first impressions of the product are excellent	4
1	great product i found it to be very easy to use and hassle free	4
1	i'm new to web design i 've tried other products including frontpage and found them too cumbersome to use and the results were not what i wanted dreamweaver is the best easy to use with more tools to make your web pages look great even for a beginner and there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out	4
1	i'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings this program fits all of my basic needs this is the first piece of audio software i 've ever owned but i know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what i guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you 've used audition 1 5 or cooledit however as my introduction to music editing the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and i like the endless options adobe provides for organizing the workspace one tip if you are a student or teacher do n't spend 300 do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over 100	4
1	i like the features the same as i did with cool edit 2000 i have n't had the opportunty to explore all the new features but it looks promising	4
1	quickbooks lives up to it 's reputation of being the one size fits all small business book keeping software it does what you want it to do i like the feature of being able to easily sent e mail invoices if you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores	4

1	cd installs easily it even comes with a nice short instructional video once installed zoneaalarm is fairly unobtrusive but seems to get the job done well designed product	4
1	this ia a top rated anti virus softare the price is good and the software is great	4
1	i am satisfied with the product for that matter i know it before i bought and i am satisfied with it the only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet still i would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety	4
1	this product is a very simple to use extremely efficient tool i am very pleased with results it produced for me	4
1	seems to do the trick i do n't use it personally but mom likes it	4

1	i have been using printmaster platinun for several years and love it i scrapbook constantly using all of the features i have printed thousands of items with this program if people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer i have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook photo programs and only use printmaster there is no better program ann	4
1	i 've been using printmaster for years to create greeting cards party invitations banners and posters for my kids' school this version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his ipod i 'd reccomend it to anyone who likes printmaster or wants to create great looking projects at home	4
1	for the first time in several versions microsoft has changed the file format however it is for the better the new files are all compressed using the zip compression format so files are much smaller \( old files are 3 4 times larger than new files \) the new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification \( i e linux geeks can open office documents \) the new interface is radically different do not install this if you have a large project to complete the interface is so different you will not complete on time however after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it	4
1	microsoft office ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it it is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use	4
1	good modeling tool with great 3 d graphics which allows the user to view from any direction the component selection is adequate and the tutorial was informative allowing me to get started designing within the first hour of installing the product	4
1	do n't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package it is the full version ready to be installed do n't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start so far i have not noticed a dime 's worth of difference from the pro version it is working great however the vista coupon shipped with my package expired on march 15 2007 additionally the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between october 26 2006 and march 15 2007 so do n't let the vista thing induce you	4
1	do n't listen to all that crap about how you should get linux or buy a mac instead of buying windows that will probably be the dumbest choice in your life this is the full version of windows oem software comes with activation code and vista upgrade coupon to either vista home basic or home premium bought from tiger direct through amazon	4
1	my daughter loves sims so i got this to help her improve her spanish it is fun to play for adults too the complete immersion method is more effective for learning a new language	4
1	what a wonderful game addictive and motivating ! if you want to be able to make original sentences you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar but for eazy speak this is right on the target ! fun for any computer user ! looking for spanish curriculum for younger kids \? try flip flop spanish which has a cd with the writable workbook	4

1	i had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7 even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs i can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes this reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document for these reasons i'm quite satisfied with the purchase	4
1	this is a perfect office suite for those who do n't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007 outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang ups in earlier additions probably more stuff in here than most people need but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements	4
1	i am very pleased with the product i had trouble with my system and microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues	4
1	microsoft office pro 2003 edition is a good product it installed easily over office pro 1997 i have n't had any problems with it \( yet \) it relies heavily on online links you probably should have a fast dsl connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links update i am using windows xp with office pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions	4
1	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4
1	it would be nice if the contents were listed with all of microsoft 's versions it gets confusing	4
1	the layout of office 2003 is better than office 2003 which has improved my efficiency for those who spend all day working with the outlook package it 's worth the money to upgrade	4
1	i love this especially for it 's basic qualities i originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1 44 floppy that i got from my dentist went to version 2001 a few years later with version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it and i knew i would have to upgrade some time i was comfortable with 2001 so i was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again for someone who does n't have the need for all the extras this is perfect	4
1	very easy to follow especially if you 've used quicken in the past reports are set up just a little bit different total at top of category instead of bottom so you need to get accustomed to that overall great produc	4
1	\( review written by my wife the user \) i 've happily used the quicken checkbook program for many years when we changed operating systems from windows xp to windows vista i was unable to get the quicken 2002 version to work in vista so i purchased quicken basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program the only feature i use is the checkbook program and as far as i'm concerned it 's perfect i 've never used the download from bank option because i prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives i use edit preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and i could n't be happier the price is reasonable too	4
1	great for managing your basic accounts and finances easy to use worth the price interacts well with online banking services	4
1	for a basic money management software this product met my expectations no frills but very easy to use convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction i set my account up in 20 minutes there is n't a manual but for the price and ease of use i do n't need one	4
1	when my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing i missed the most was being able to balance my check book glad to be back on track i like the new look	4
1	i use this with a macbook laptop with 2gb ram without any performance issues it is a great product for when you have outgrown imovie but do n't need the full feature set of final cut i use it for both perosnal and work video production no problems connecting and moving video of a panasonic pv gs500 video camera via firewire there is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master	4
1	this was given to my son who is going to be living in china this summer and presently knows no chinese he 's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language a microphone is a must with this program only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used like an old man driving a car	4
1	4 different methods to learn the language i am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new the only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language very user friendly	4
1	this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike it no longer supports windows 98 which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years the street maps it produces are accurate except for a few minor glitches	4
1	the program is great sometimes the gps is slightly off though i 'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that i'm off route for no reason not really a big deal just annoying other than that i recommend it as a cheaper version of a gps sysytem if you own a laptop	4
1	this is the second generation of this software i have owned it is a great navagation tool better than most online sites and can be used in the car i marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the lexington kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth with new streets and roads the software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map so you do n't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night major points of interest are also on the map	4
1	i use my microsoft streets and trips software to plan my route intermediate stops and destination for any travel via automobile or truck i am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which i may be unfamiliar this is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find i have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what streets and trips does and i found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with microsoft streets and trips 2007	4
1	i have used this product for the last three years and i am very satisfiedwith it and recommend it highly	4
1	i find turbo tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program i really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version does n't come with state tax features well if you are going to shop online you 'd better learn to read the specifications for products ! i came to amazon precisely because i knew i 'd be able to find what i needed for less texas has no state income tax so i make sure that i buy turbo tax for federal only thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest	4
1	it was an excellent purchase fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality	4
1	its a good software it works good and keep the computer safe from spam virus and some others malware try it	4
1	i bought adobe acrobat 8 0 professional for home use after having used an older version at work the software was very easy to install activate and register and i liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features since i am active with three community service organizations i welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media binders this program makes it easier to email formal reports create handbills and pamphlets and post them to my web page	4
1	at first i had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface once i got used to it though i find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate it 's a great step forward in all senses for acrobat ! !	4
1	it 's quite a bit slower than version 7 but it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds	4
1	we found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve the lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one 's learning style the accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program we appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons so far we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases	4
1	drills are excellent vocabulary has good variety picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language	4
1	i am fluent in spanish so the rosetta stone italian language software was perfect for me it is very easy to understand to follow and to learn if you study one hour per day in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases i do n't have any regret at all i think my investment was worthwhile	4
1	great product simple to use after short training from accountant it is in and running	4
1	i was a little diappointed when i found out that i would have to buy more versions to get continued training on this subject	4
1	i have been a word perfect user for years but found i could not open files that were received from professional organizations and attorneys that was the reason for purchasing microsoft works this has been a great asset for our business thank yo	4
1	works work what cam i say i have been using microsoft products for years quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant	4
1	understand i have a full ms new office suite that i got from work but choose to use this product for the many items included which ca n't be beat if you just want to use word and nothing else then get it alone this is fine but the other products are worth the discount and rebate also cost is the lowest i found if you have a reward ceriticate using amazon credit card that 25 more off the price so in the end it cost me 30 for it shop smart and use any break you could get right \?	4
1	i use ms office at work and at home but for my daughter 's computer this was perfect most people do n't need the full version of office and this package has so much for so little money the full version of word is reason enough to spend this amount of money note this is not the latest version but who cares i would say this is one of the best software deals out there unless you need 100 office compatiblity this is the package for you if you do buy the student and teacher version of ms office read the fine print it is for anyone not using it for business	4
1	it seems no longer possible to buy ms word as a stand alone program so to get it one buys microsoft works suite this way one gets word one version back from the most current version plus encarta streets and trips etc when purchasing be sure to distinguish between the cd version and the dvd version the latter comes on a single disk the former on about six also note this is not the same as microsoft works a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer it has its own peculiar word processor spreadsheet etc for more than word look for the student and teacher edition of ms office suite	4
1	i am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of excel word etc opening up files it tends to be a bit sluggish on the plus side i found word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents in word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us	4
1	office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions the program was stable for me at least and the new interface was very nice it may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface one thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default there is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option is n't compatible with earlier programs	4
1	wow ! i must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003 it did take some time to get the hang of it because microsoft changed around the icons and buttons however i do like it because now in word excel and powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide in the end i think the 2007 is much more user friendly than 2003 i recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the new 2007 microsoft office	4
1	if you 're looking for a professional office suite ms office 2007 has no real competitors i 've worked extensively with corel office and some with open office they 're fine for the basics and they cost less but if you 're looking for effectiveness integration speedy productivity and an incredible array of tools you 'll want to buy ms office 2007 and as an added bonus the interface makes it a pleasure to work in	4
1	i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one the video tutorials are the greatest help of all the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want but that is not the easiest task i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true	4
1	really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now the tutorial is helping a great deal i am positive that i will find all the right buttons	4
1	i love this program ! ! ! it is so great to see the dimensions wall colors decorating ideas at my fingertips	4
1	i'm 9 years old and play this game frequently i love to play it it 's not frustrating at all and it 's totally exciting with many adorable animals i did n't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then i bought a dresser and changed her outfit the pigs are fun to treat ! ! ! ! ! they 're smart ! ! the rabbits are soft and adorable having my favorite animal being rabbits i play this game for at least a half an hour a day and ca n't wait for the next time playing it ! ! ! ! get this game and try it out ! ! it 's the best !	4
1	i did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly but it 's a fantastic game you get a building with your waiting room exam room living room and bedroom you build animal pens outside buy medical equipment buy books to learn about caring for each species and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals sleep eat and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed care for play with and clean up after it 's a fun and well designed game	4
1	i'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is i used norton for approximately 5 years before i changed to bit defender i did n't realize how bogged down my system was until i made the change the system scan is very quick \( approx 8 10 minutes in comparison to 20 25 minutes from norton \) i do n't even notice when the software is updating i'm very pleased with the program thus far and i highly recommend it	4
1	installed quickly and with no problems does not slow the machine down as much as norton antivirus	4
1	the last reviewer did n't see any point to this software partially that 's true you do n't need it to create your photostamp you can do the same thing online however there is one big plus to the software product buying a single sheet of photostamps direct from their website costs 24 99 2 99 shipping at this writing in contrast amazon is selling this boxed version which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps for seven bucks less than that do the math	4
1	i thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results it works better than some of the more expensive software i have tried at least a half dozen similar programs but i keep returning to this bargain bin favorite for the money it is an excellent value	4
1	i ca n't believe this application i bought it last year and i have 200 pages completed i can truthfully say that i will never scrapbook the traditional way from this moment on so fast and easy ! i will be all up to date with my scrap booking for x mas '05 i am overjoyed i do n't believe i know anyone who scrapbooks traditionally anymore ! thanks for simplifying my life	4
1	actually comic book creator lets you use your content in a million different ways including reselling of your work the only limitation is that you ca n't sell comics created around branded content like images from marvel paramount tokyopop etc because they do n't allow that it 's all in the user agreement check it out	4
1	do n't expect to receive this by christmas even though it says in stock i ordered this on dec 14th and just received word today the 20th that it is not expected to ship until the end of january early february so if you need it for a specific occasion do n't count on it getting there in time	4
1	loaded easily no glitches the online account access feature became functional after running the software update the program is fully functional and i have suffered no inconvenience running this on an intel based macbook	4
1	simply the tool for getting your business put together it 's able to do just about everything you 'd ever want to do ! !	4
1	i 've only been using this program for about a month its not a simple program for me for i'm not business savvy with help of a cpa and the wonderful tutorials and help program i'm getting the program and its working so well ! i love it	4
1	i would recommand this software to anyone that burns dvd cd it is user friendly and easy to navigate	4
1	one of the best programs that i have to work with cd dvd	4
1	other similar products were too complicated all i wanted was something simple i got exactly what i needed to convince myself i had my act together i found it in this product big e z bookkeeping helped me simplify my bookkeeping without the anxiety it 's just enough for my family accounts thank you	4
1	i have a new compaq pc amd athlon 64 1 2 gig ram 200 gb hdd and nis 2005 came pre installed it worked and continues to work fine for me and i am able to get all my updates regularly w o any problems however i am a single desktop user with normal needs not a power user that and if you have a high end pc then this product should be quite adequat	4
1	i am enjoying the talk now ! learn bulgarian cd great images repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words numbers time etc easy also the games add interest you can print out each section with photos and words in bulgarian however i would have liked to see the program come with the cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide	4
1	there are a lot of good things about this software the major pull back is the learning curve othervise it 's a 5 star one by the way be sure to set the correct elevation of your house to start with or you wo n't be able to change it once you put on walls windows everything	4
1	this was my second purchase of a product like this and i loved it the first one i tried was difficult to use it was so easy to use my husband and i were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed it helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring my favorite feature was the home estimator feature that tracked our materials useage	4
1	looked at them all and then bought this software it can do a lot of things so yes it might take a bit to learn and get fast with there is a reason it has been voted best for several years now it does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying garbage in garbage out 8 \) my wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she 's working on anything this complete is worth the learning curve	4
1	amazing program ! definitely building my skills in the interior design field would recommend to anyone	4
1	this program is dependable and adequate within the limits that it is avertised to do for instance it wo n't keep track of inventory since it was not designed to do so	4
1	there have been enough changes for the better to make this product well worth the purchase installation learning curve	4
1	i use this program daily and it is awesome ! it has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place the features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view great improvements over previous versions	4
1	i have been supporting quickbooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years this year 's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer 's invoices payments estimates all in the same window just by clicking on a customer in the list no more multiple clicks to create customer reports it is just plain easy and the information pops up on your screen immediately congratulations to intuit on a job well done	4
1	the fact that they call this premier is a little overdone the reality is that this is the pro version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price	4
1	even though i do n't belong to the art profession and have only very limited knowledge of the arts i feel the contents are great and useful based on my discussion with friends who are artists i therefore bought it for my friends in the arts profession overseas	4
1	i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift it 's a pretty good method sometimes a bit difficult to work with but you do learn some things i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp so make sure you have all the right equipment and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who 's taken guitar lessons	4
1	i picked this up for my twelve year old son he is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and emedia rock guitar method for the last two weeks the program is a great starter just in case the kids do n't stick with it it 's better than 45 bucks an hour once a week for now at least great product ! i reccomend it	4
1	i thought this was a great product it 's like having your own guitar instructor but even better you only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want also you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip i'm pleased with my purchase you will be too	4
1	i recently purchased this from a book club and it is a wonderful bible type is easy to read and the imitation leather binding cover is of high quality the various colors help guide you to passages of the same intent very innovative great	4
1	i really love this bible even for someone who is well versed in bible scripture this adds a new dimension to your understanding i purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i purchased one for my mom for mother 's day	4
1	simply superb programme and the standard by which other image manipulation software is judged allbeit with some disparagement the advancements made from my first ps 3 through to ps 6 and now cs and cs2 has been truly remarkable however think i will sit out cs 3 and catch up	4
1	the response was very fast the item came as advertised it works on my mac g4 very nicely	4
1	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4
1	absolutely love this program i 'd been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity making it an exceptionally good security program	4
1	i 've been using this for several years without ever having a problem i like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before it uses less system resources than norton plus i know people that have gotten viruses using norton mcafee kaspersky always rates in the top three the only drawback is there is no anti spyware but i do n't feel that is an issue let them worry about viruses such i 'll continue using webroot 's spysweeper to control spyware together they make a great combo to keep my computer clean	4
1	i have used works type products for years microsoft works 7 is the best of the lot it will work on almost any computer in use today and is definitely a best buy at the current price	4
1	i have used ms works from about the time it was born when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable but i have continued to use it primarily for databases because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use these are not all small and simple databases many include several thousand items each with 20 to 30 fields of data it is easy to quot find quot single items or to assemble groups of items \( quot filter quot \) and to print customized reports so if you do n't need \( or want \) the super sophistication of access i have found works to be a friendly and helpful and inexpensive alternative	4
1	i put ms works on all systems that i make for other people it has everything they need and it dose n't break the bank the only thing i do n't like is that there is no presentation software or powerpoint clone then again if they included that ms office sales would go down a lot ! !	4
1	i bought this product because i had tried with great success another punch product it was so easy to use and load onto my computer it was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls to my deck and plants outside	4
1	daughter plays it all the time pretty quick shipping brand new excellent seller	4
1	my 11 year old daughter loves playing this game graphics could be better but overall it teaches them a lot about horses and how to take care of them great for any horse lover in your family	4
1	my 12 year old daughter plays this game for hours at a time she is a horse nut and loves it the player gets to groom breed and train horses i would definetly recommend for any horse crazy kid	4
1	i bought this and i think it is a very good game but i can not really continue the game because i lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things i am going to keep on trying to finish the game if you are really good at solving games and love horse i would get this game and anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game	4
1	i have used norton for years i am very pleased with the product and feel that it does a very good job of protecting my computer	4
1	excellent product one any computer owner must own and install for efficient and safe daily opperation online quick delivery with ideal ups tracking ensureing accuate deivery and not to mention the best price online bravo zulu ! good show amazon	4
1	i am very pleased with the way this remote performs i have my computer conected to my tv and with this remote i am able to control my computer from the living room to watch tv watch dvds that i have on my hard drives and listen to music beyond media works great with the remote and is very user friendly	4
1	have been using acrobat since v3 v4 v6 v8 is in line seems a bit faster smoother etc have tried imitations on other machines from a purely subjective view acrobat is best a bit pricey but the best with the usual caveats can be installed on a desktop and a notebook but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth	4
1	this is a major upgrade from previous versions much easier to use and a much cleaner format	4
1	i have used tax cut for several years have had no complaints it is easy to use and is very complete plan to use it again next year	4
1	it was easy to use plus i could import my old tax info from last year my bank info and my deductions i electronically filed my taxes and had my refund within two weeks i buy this product every year and was pleased that deduction pro was included	4
1	installed on windows xp with no problem and have already done an e file before the mid feburary update mentioned by others no problems with either having used turbotax for 6 years i had been led to believe that taxcut was inferior to turbotax i was pleased to discover that taxcut is just as good as turbotax and it 's cheaper too ! it also includes a rebate for a free federal e file something that intuit quietly has removed from this year 's turbotax i plan to use taxcut from now on	4
1	i think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning however it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program in order to get the most out of the program i feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level lesson	4
1	i can never understand why others would want to use anything else i have tried four others and this one has been the best of all i now have been using this product starting about 1989 i upgrade about every 3 to four year	4
1	the software is better than the previous family tree deluxe version i bought it allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested the merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary	4
1	i fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version when ancestry updated this year i decided i had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on ancestry so purchased this version i was very pleasantly surprised and happy i am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info i have entered incorrectly but i would certainly recommend it the online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome	4
1	though it may lack some of the integrated tools of quicken or other financial software ms money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs	4
1	i upgraded to this version from money 2000 the interface looks cleaner and the reports and budgeting options are better i do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that i am used to overall i'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better i think it will last me for several years	4
1	money has built in value for the none accoundant person with little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time microsoft has a winner	4
1	i bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit the maps look good although i hav n't noticed much change from version 2005 there are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated a little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going it has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use the phonebook is very nice !	4
1	i am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru but based on my experience with this product i am very satisfied i love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease i have only used it for a month now and i still have to use some of the applications yet if you have the money and will love to have a new office suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day go for it	4
1	this anti virus \( and everything else \) software was highly recommended by my company 's network tech for stand alone computer home use it is significantly better than any others \( especially norton \) because it is not a memory hog so does n't slow your machine down	4
1	a very effective internet security package we installed this on my girlfriend 's pc a few months ago and it 's done a super job in keeping her machine trouble free two thumbs up effective easy to install and use and keep updated a real winner	4
1	i am so satisfied with this trendmicro security system that i highly recommend it to everyone without mentioning my previous system this is tops ! i have never felt so secure before getting this system thank you for being able to supply me with it i hope through word of mouth and mail that i have caused others to go for it i do know of 3 people at least who are changing thank you again	4
1	as a beta user i assure you that this will make your life easier by not having to stock a lot of forms from the court	4
1	excellent product the 'over 450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value during installation the 1 year free trial to showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker com support and a subsequent call to ancestry com support ancestry com provided a 1 year free trial to their us deluxe product over the phone and did n't ask for a credit card number for renewal to me that 's a sign that they 're a reputable company some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation cd but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install especially the gensmart software	4
1	i have used a few other genealogy products and this is the best so far i am a novice and for me family tree is easy to use and has a lot more features than roots magic the initial cost was more but the extras included made it a better value	4
1	i have not had a chance to thoroughly review this product but i was disappointed the calendar feature could not display the information i wanted especially since i had contacted customer service prior to purchasing the program and was assured it could be done	4
1	i have been using the family tree maker products for a number of years i love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts i am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder i feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly both visually and functionally	4
1	this sw is fantastic having the on line access made this product perfect without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know i was able to get info on my family back to the 1800 's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research \( relatives i do n't even know \)	4
1	i am new at researching my family history the v16 collector 's ed of family tree maker was just what i needed as an extra bonus it has a 1 yr subscription to to enhance the research capabilities i would definitely recommenend this program	4
1	this is a great program if you never owned an older version of family treemaker the new version is so similar to the older versions it doesn't pay to upgrade	4
1	the product of windows xp professional is just what i was looking for with many updated features and i am looking forward in using it daily it was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it but most of all service was top knotch i could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems i may have had customer service is a plus i would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	4
1	i think that this is a very good operating system but it is far too overpriced ! a note to the person who has the issue with disk 4 of his setup disk set try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy if that does't work then boot into ms dos with a windows 98se bootdisk and select the cd rom drive letter and then type cd i386 then type winnt then it will start the installation from the compact disc i gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better operating system for that price	4
1	i have been using computers since dos 5 0 and this is by far the most user friendly comprehensive and powerful operating system i have used so far aside from linux if you are interested in an easy to use dynamic os go with xp professional it has lots of features that are always coming in handy unless you wanna go crazy and are an it power user \( in which case linux \) go with this os its great	4
1	i found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process it appears to be slower in handling bmps larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects a real memory hog the new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy so far it is not crashing like 12 did	4
1	i have used corel draw for many years and too many had serious problems this version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic it is still a complicated system though	4
1	very good it does what i want and more now to get more training on doing more with this produc	4
1	this new version is cleaner and better than v12 in several areas that are important to me particularily the improved trace features	4
1	coreldraw x3 is a fine product it has added some nice features from v 11 coreldraw came with a rebate and i must say amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it on line was a joke replied by e mail 3 time never got a reponse talked to reps 2 times they did not help yes i got the product in 5 days but if you have a small problem amazon aint gunna get r done	4
1	he trabajado por 14 anos con coreldraw desde casi sus inicios para verlo convertirse en un programa realmente poderoso sin competencia en su area a mi parecer en esta nueva version de corel el x3 les digo que no me ha desilucionado no hay muchas herramientas nuevas pero son excelentes lo bueno es que se estan dedicando a mejorar las herramientas anteriores lo que es mucho mejor todavia	4
1	i 've been using system mechanic 6 professional for about a month i 'd have to say that the overall performance of windows xp has improved greatly since installation upon starting system mechanic a general report is given on the overall health of windows it fixes problems in the registry defragments the hard drives ram and boosts internet performance all of this is done is done in a short period of time \( under an hour \) i 've also read all the negative reviews on amazon i'm not going to dispute any of them since each user has his her own experiences using the product all i can say is that i'm glad that the software worked for me	4
1	you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very messy system but it does have a great antivirus and firewall and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes it 's an okay product but be very careful with the cleanup tool it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	4
1	system mechanic 6 professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems i was having with my computer it also alerts you of impending problems i highly recommends this product	4
1	this book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field one may not necessarily agree with prof leveson 's views \( e g her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering \) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored ! the book is a good bed time reading that gives an overview of the field major problems and introduction to some major approaches it is however not a handbook per se you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it overall very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language	4
1	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book as kids progress through sections on prime numbers the fibonacci series pascal 's triangle and an infinite series approaching one nine of the ten games worked well for us but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth the arrow game we understood the math but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows this was disappointing because we could never reach the bonus section all in all though this is a good investment for a child 8 or up who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers	4
1	i purchased fix it primarily to correct a registry problem it was rated very highly on the pcworld website it did a great job i had over 850 registry errors corrected them and did a reorg on the registry my computer is running beter now the other utilities included work as advertised i have been using norton systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price	4
1	i think this is the best version to come out yet i would have a high end pc if i was to upgrade only software i would just wait and buy a new pc its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security the firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there its got alot more features and run 's good 's device drivers are easyier to load scott	4
1	this software was easy to install the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood my one wish is that there were more varied games included but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging	4
1	this is a great product to manage your email calendar and contacts this program has great power and features and is now much easier to use	4
1	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version 2002 but i found the new features to be very good for example the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used it was catching junk from the very beginning and has missed very few things i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use installation was seemless i think it might be a little overpriced but considering how long i will keep it it 's not too bad	4
1	this is an excellent product for kids my kid loves to learn with this software i had issues installing this product other than installation issues it has been excellent we are having fun now ! i will recommend this title for kids starting on chess	4
1	my children absolutely love this version they wake at 5 a m to play before school my son says it 's great i 've learned lots of tips and now i'm a much better chess player why a 4 star and not 5 \? the down side the game does n't allow the player to save at a certain level totally frustrates the kids when they want to return they have to start at the beginning again	4
1	great deal great price great product emedia guitar method is by far one of the greatest computer learn to play programs out there my order netted me a brand new factory fresh product securely and quickly shipped thanks again	4
1	my 5 and 6 year olds did n't seem to want to play maybe too hard i enjoyed playing and my 11 year old twins really liked it	4
1	really great ! beautiful graphics easy to follow instructions levels to keep us going very fun and challenging	4
1	my five and six year old love this game ! it sparks their interest in things around them and now we play our own i spy riddles in the car at dinner or out on walks i highly recommend it	4
1	i bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in german he speaks english at home with his mother i think that this game will help him with his english	4
1	this item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it thanks	4
1	i was amazed how colorful the graphics are in this game my 6 year took right to it and played it for 2 hours the first sitting she mastered level 2 pretty easy and is on to level 3 our computer runs windows and we have had no problems this is a great game to buy for the summer to keep kids up to speed between k and 1st grade	4
1	my 4 year old son received this as a christmas present he has really enjoyed playing it so far he can do most of the activities without help there is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump which i think is pretty hard for little ones \( it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain \) there are many different learning activities matching memory shapes size etc we did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did we have a new dell computer running on windows xp	4
1	the upgrade presents a good value for a vista compatible product that includes improvements to ease of use particularly for combining documents into a single pdf	4
1	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
1	the operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer but obviously if you want a computer with more security features or networking features you should go with windows xp professional at the time that i am writing this which is a long time from when i purchased windows xp it is a time where windows vista is emerging if you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer i recommend windows xp home professional \( based on your requirements \) but if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast try windows vista but one word of warning about vista the user account control \( uac \) is a pain in the butt	4
1	i was pleaed at how quickly i began to pick up on the language i plan to purchase other rosetta stone products in the futur	4
1	this language learning software is the best i have ever tried you can work with the lesson material in several different ways utilizing your favorite method of learning expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor the package is well worth the cost	4
1	this is a great language learning program you get going on it and before you know it you are ten lessons ahead i 've learned a lot already	4
1	my husband is using the rosetta stone spanish program and loves it	4
1	a great bargain you get full office professional vp and full version of windows for under 300 dollars after waiting for months and months for office 2004 professional to be released when it finally came out i was ecstatic one problem vp 7 0 would n't install on my g5 only on my laptop i called microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2 0 gb of ram i downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden the moral of the story is that microsoft underestimates the needs of mac users because they are used to wimpy pcs that have no ram	4
1	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment the product provides learning words together with listening seeing and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace the product has been worth it 's hefty price i do recommend purchasing a german english dictionary to accompany the software i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings	4
1	i tried an inexpensive program first and found it just did n't work this program has been fantastic !	4
1	i purchased this product to put 2 cds together i had never attempted something like this and was a total novice audio cleaning lab was terrific ! i found it easy to understand and use with unexpected options that improved the project i was working on my one word to describe it simple or maybe effective or maybe straightforward or maybe uncomplicated or maybe useful or maybe valuable or maybe	4
1	in my opionion act ! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market i am not talking about a complex crm solution but it is a fine contact manager i am not using the outlook and palm interfaces and i do n't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time the built in email features are okay seach features are excellent just give it a 30 day trial and compare to goldmine maximizer and others	4
1	with this software you can create a 2 d or 3 d game follow the tutorial you can download from www thegamecreators com \( producers of the software \) and you will create a real game in about 2 weeks of nights this box is the full package the software is not as fully supported as the professional version but for a hobbiest it is perfect	4
1	i own hallmark card studio 2006 and this product is a different interesting addition to greeting card making it has lots of kinds of pictures i e aquatic mammals fish etc for making fun children 's cards	4
1	this is another great card making product but i do n't believe as good as hallmark but \? i still use it a whole lot and love it ! i know you will too ! try it out ! and take a chance on a great product	4
1	i think this is actually a very good os there are a lot of new features and home premium appears to be the best vista os for the money i purhased a new pc with this os and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to ultimate for 150 only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non microsoft products not excatly sure why this is microsoft 's problem though regardless this os is the smart choice for a new pc for home use accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new os then upgrade otherwise wait till you need a new pc	4
1	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	4
1	i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout that said my initial take is very positive as a writer and lousy typist i think it will increase my productivity expotentially i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon	4
1	in my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches that means books tapes tutoring and experience in a country that uses it i have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix i highly reccomend it if you 're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it	4
1	we ordered this program only two weeks before moving to bogota columbia for a two year tour however the spanish rosetta stone taught was much higher level than the survival spanish we needed when we arrived overall we are learning the language and it is a great program wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing	4
1	it 's a great product especially for someone like me who works long hours and no chance of getting to take a language class formally this is the way to go ! thank you	4
1	i do n't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did and realize that you forgot to select test at the beginning also it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also not just the regular exercises other than these two things the program is very good	4
1	i recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not thepro version which costs 150 more and gives more functionality this is a fully functioning animation software with lots ofinteresting features i can see no reason that a noviceanimator such as i am would not be happy with this software i would like to see more energy put into a manual but youcan scavenge the anime blog chat site to find answers orgoogle other places with a more robust manual this wouldbe 5 stars not 4 it is really the reason i am reluctantto upgrade to pro because i would want more lessons andtutorials to go along with the upgrade if you have an interest in animating this is the softwarefor you	4
1	anime studio 5 is surprisingly powerful fairly easy to get started with and appears to have a lot of power waiting to be exploited	4
1	turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return	4
1	this product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes this is the first time we 've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete you can go back and change things or review them it gives you a way to e file you can print out all the copies that you may need i was surprised how easy it was to use however it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer i was very happy with it	4
1	my only reccomendation would be a better user interface it can be a bit confusing the underlying functions work well though	4
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles they are multi column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors in fact because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working way to go nuance	4
1	i only have the basic and its good but i 've seen this and it has to be the ing koolest thing you can have right now i highly recommened it for begginers to experts	4
1	i give the db pro 5 stars but i am totally disappointed in amazon com and the gamecreaters heres whythe first thing i noticed is my box is different than that shown here http darkbasicpro thegamecreators comi didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link abovei cant find theover 45 demo 'sover 25 tutorialsover 600 texturesover 120 sound effects900 3d modelsthat is stated here http darkbasic thegamecreators com i applied the 59 upgrade patch and now my program wont start it says its missing msvcr71 dll file the original version was 1 05i cant believe the darkbasic com is advertising this product yet amazon com is shipping some ancient version hopefully i will be able to resolve this issue	4
1	was using datamanager but disliked the constant disk access in background acronis backs up well without constant background disk access and uses less disk space	4
1	purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one i put the new drive in a usb external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software in about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly i have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup the menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward	4
1	the product does just what i want it to do i needed a backup system that was reliable and simple to use i ordered a harddrive with it and the combination of the two works just fine b	4
1	acronis true image 10 0 home is really great for making backups and moving entire partitions to a new disk very easy foolproof and dependable good product good price	4
1	poser user since version 3 poser continues to improve more life like faster	4
1	the software was just what i expected and very useful to me when creating publisher documents that need to be emailed to clients	4
1	the program is over what i expected performance is great and such a useful tool	4
1	many more fonts to choose from an excellent value	4
1	i like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer however i think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue	4
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour this includes capital gains losses dividends and amt calculations it does n't get much easier than this yes you have to download updates the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it but would n't that take at least as long	4
1	my son is absolutely loves this dvd games i have to turn off the main switch to the computer in order to keep him off of it and play with his sister he learned so much since i got this learning system and i am totally extati	4
1	my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it	4
1	it is a little bit clumsey when i go to it instead of my cursor being in the space where i write the word for a definition i have to place it there and that takes time the first one of these electronic dictionaries i had \( about 5 years ago \) was fabulous it was called deluxe and had everything but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again	4
1	this software is very user friendly easy to install easy to use i would recommend it to anyone	4
1	it is wondeful software simple easy to use user friendly and very accurate in the pronunciation buy this cd do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam webster 's website also try the medical dictionary it is as equally superb	4
1	i purchased this software mainly for web design i am beginning in web design and found microsoft frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lotof interesting features to design a web site i would definitely recommend this product	4
1	frontpage 2003 is a great easy to use wysiwyg web builder most hosting companies support frontpage extensions a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site similar to dhtml two warnings though 1 \) this full version is too expensive you may qualify to buy the half priced academic version \( search for frontpage 2003 academic on amazon \) 2 \) more important though frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by office sharepoint designer \( for businesses \) and expression web \( for everyone else \) you can download the latter for free \( for now at least \) on msft 's website	4
1	given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt frontpage was a a really big help i was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering i did n't realize though that frontpage is n't the cureall for making a website really primarily only for web design i e if you want to make a website with e commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like you 're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in asp or php but as far as web design goes frontpage can take a novice a long way	4
1	it was some years ago when i bought a previous cd version of this encyclopedia although technology has advanced and wikipedia has come into existence encyclopedia britannica is more reliable	4
1	the hard copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries now you can have all of that with video audio tons of photos and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original for what you get it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library	4
1	i trust the information i find from britannica and so invested in the 2007 britannica ultimate reference suite it has something for everyone i use it side by side with microsoft encarta and together i get a more complete subject review i prefer the content of britannica but for ease of use encarta is still superior i look forward to britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why i am only able to award 4 stars	4
1	i have used quicken for over 12 years whenever i got a new version it always worked for me but it has too many things on it that i do n't need i like to keep it more simple for me so i just use the register reconcile reports and lists catagories for all i use it for i am happy with it	4
0	this was n't actually a card game it was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each they is no way that this can be played as a card game the box does n't even indicate that it 's a card game i thought this would be a fun card game for my husband daughter to play together you can purchase magazines with more games for less price i would n't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games i'm returning it buying an electronic version for husbands pda the price is about the same	5
0	i bought this for my 2 yr old daughter i was so surprised at the quality for little tykes it has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed i think it should cost half of what it does i purchased the step two kitchen when my daughter was three and it is way better by far	5
0	i bought this for my 5 year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it within a few days of careful use one of the latches bent a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued it is a great idea but needs better construction on a positive note my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if i let her however i had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before i can fix it the drawers work fine the problem is with the two doors on top that flip out note about drawers little plastic door knobs pop out need to be glued in	5
0	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	5
0	i am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects this was a christmas gift and i was never so disappointed in the quality of this item it arrived with crayons broken and the ones that were n't you could n't even use on paper the markers are dry and caps do n't stay on this is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous ! ! ! definitely would be better off purchasing these items elsewhere ! !	5
0	the case is a cheaply made box of wood that did not even survive shipping the materials contained inside are poor quality the rating does not deserve one star i returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping but it would have been returned regardless because it is garbage !	5
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard and i 've thrown most of them out already it does n't take much to crush them there are much nicer sets out there and there are separate pieces sold on ebay that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better not worth the money	5
0	i was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one and i love laugh and learn toys i got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old she never liked it i kept it out and encouraged her to play with it but she just really did n't get into it also there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid and the sticker shapes do n't match the holes ! unfortunately this toy was a big let down	5
0	i was so excited when i ordered my star wars holographic emperor figure i 'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks ! ! when i got home today the box with the amazon logo was on my doorstep upon opening the box i was completely disappointed to find that the emperor figure i 'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed the people packing this stuff are half wits ! ! anybody with a brain would know better than to cram something into a box like that ! ! they should be ashamed of their service to all you collectors out there beware ! !	5
0	my 2 year old son loves to cook and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor it is n't very sturdy but i'm not unhappy with this purchase	5
0	this game is for people to play if they 're drunk or mindless or in some cases both it 's completely pointless and uninteresting if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid sorry but i mean think about it \? why pay money for this when i can just use dice from other more interesting board games i already own \? do not waste your money ! even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little you still should n't buy it b c like i said before just use dice from other board games you already own !	5
0	my twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3 they loved it ! ! ! the dog is so cuddly and cute they loved playing pretend with the accessories my only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off the syringe was coming apart and the brush had lost a couple of bristles the boys had not played rough with it it just was n't the quality that i had hoped for it is a real favorite of theirs i am just afraid that it wo n't last as long as their imaginations i think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy a real winner for young children in the hospital	5
0	i bought this for my nine year old daughter the game in theory is great but ours does not work right and the company is not real great to deal with i am still trying to get a replacement if the game worked properly i would rate it 5 stars easily even my thirteen year old daughter loves it	5
0	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied however the screen is very disappointing i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it	5
0	we were very disappointed in this toy it does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard my older children had a spin art toy that was great it made the most spectacular designs this is not worth the effort or money	5
0	what a disappointment the spinner just ca n't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do overall it 's a cheap item with limited supplies for the	5
0	this is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child there are only two working buttons one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker there is some padding on the top but not enough the manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added overall not a good value at all for the price	5
0	i 've already spent way too much time trying to screw the basket in and hammer the wheel caps on what a pain in the neck this was the most expensive cart and i ca n't believe it 's taking this long to put together not worth it	5

0	great concept but bad design both of my children have had one for a year due to the discomfort they never use it ! it needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around	5
0	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops great height for a small kid but difficult to adjust latch always got stuck also after a few months the latch broke right off now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son now it is just a 30 peice of trash	5

0	my 2 1 2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well we tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he 's taking them off again so far he 's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers thank goodness he 's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth also like everyone else we 've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk i 've always liked the melissa and doug products we 've purchased but i would n't reccomend this easel at all	5
0	i purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have he was very excited about having his own coffee maker however after only a few days it quit working the lights and sound still work but the water wo n't run anymore he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy he still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so i will probably not return it because i think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water does n't work !	5

0	our boy doll arrived without a nose ! fisher price will not give us a new doll to replace the broken doll do n't waste your money ! ! ! ! !	5
0	i was rather disappointed with both doll tv and the item the coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic i have toddler toys made of the same material the packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible i was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs 25 00 when i contaced doll tv to discuss the item i was told that this was an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie and that they would refund my shipping costs if i removed my comments i did n't even pay for shipping !	5
0	there is no magic in this wand what appeared to be a thin wooden malfoy 's wand turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic my son was very disappointed he used his own hard earned money to purchase this item	5
0	this is a very cheaply made reproduction of malfoy 's wand whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it 's for it would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it as it 's cheap and made of plastic however for anyone else who craes about detail and feel you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel	5
0	i got this puzzle for my three children \( age 5 4 and 2 \) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds so removing one means it does n't work the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking but why buy a toy which makes you worry \? we were really disappointed	5
0	i am now the laughing stock of my friends why because i payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever my atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this there are bars that have the projected gtee screen that makes the game all most real i feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words it sucks	5
0	the batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman but this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with you have to insert it just so to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son does n't always do it then i have to get a butter knife and pry it out so i can put it in for him for 10 dollars it 's worth it so long as your child does n't absolutely want a shooting batmobile ps my sister bought the same one for her son this christmas and is having the same problem so i do not think it is unique to mine	5
0	i do n't know if we got some old box left over or what magnets are so weak that kids ca n't make anything vertical they just collapse and slide if i knew of course i would n't have purchased i got rid of the box so i could n't even return it over priced big time ! !	5
0	this product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items objects shapes my daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product she lost interest after 10 minutes	5
0	not only did this phone not work but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up the flashing light was distracting and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all and where the heck was the texting \? \? \? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone but you can only get 0 calls froim it and really limited reception in the mountains switch to a razr as soon as possible	5
0	my daughter just about flipped when she received this toy as a birthday gift ! so immediately after the party my husband went aboutputting it together my five year old played with this for all of about 30 seconds before a piece came off we 've had it for about two weeks now and every time you touch this thing some peice comes off no one plays with it it 's just too much of a hassle to keep together my advice but something else	5
0	my daughter really wanted the cloud kingdom for christmas as soon as i saw the quality of it i should have returned it but i knew it would break her heart it takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most barbie houses my daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together so she hardly plays with it this toy is definately not worth the money i wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy	5
0	this was very cheaply made i was disappointed in it 's quality also it comes apart constantly all my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart i am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it we have many barbie toys and this is by far the worst i have ever purchased not to mention that is was expensive ! i expected much much better quality from a barbie product	5
0	i ca n't believe that they actually put the word 3 d on the box of this thing how dare they advertise this as a fun and usefull learning experience i wish i had read the reviews before i bought it there is absolutely no 3d value to this at all they should have just made it plain 2d and then it would have been cool	5
0	the slides are awful and repetitive my son had to keep asking me what they were pictures of and i could n't even answer him i think the only thing he liked was when i turned the unit on without any slides and the light projected onto the ceiling he thought that looked more like a moon that the acual slide did huge disappointment ! ! ! and the base of the unit is worthless	5
0	do n't be deceived by the box dread pirate looks like a really cool game with exceptionally made components but it is dreadfully boring to play the game is slow tedious and completely luck based and simply no fun to play you have been warned	5
0	no wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks it does not work and the quality is sub par i have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst i have seen do not take if it was free garbarge and disappointment await i gave one star because you have to but i would give negitive stars if i could	5
0	i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway it was the worst gift i 've ever bought please do n't even waste your money trust me check the reviews first now that 's worth it	5
0	leave this one on the shelf ! ! a hotwheels product which does n't come with wheels ! \? \? \? \? ! ! ! who would have thought at 25 00 it does n't come with a car and then they have the nerve to make it not work with other hotwheels cars ! ! this is a very annoying junk toy which was such a disappointment to my son christmas morning i would not have been so disatisfied had i shopped on amazon and got it for the price being offered now 5 00 ! !	5
0	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again \( if you know how to turn the sound off let me know i'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire \) do not buy this toy you 'll be very disappointed in it	5
0	was a lot smaller than i expected my daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit because she could n't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick	5
0	the toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids they play games against friends who are strangers on the web they chat but only with preapproved messages there is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more i do n't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy i really do n't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the webkinz site	5
0	my one year old and i love these blocks they are light soft and provide endless opportunity for imagination however they are extremely expensive and of inferior quality construction when we opened the box we found that several of the blocks were not cut along a straight edge making them difficult to stack also several of the identical shape blocks were not exactly the same size leading to stacking problems one of the blocks was peeling in one corner these blocks are such a great idea i find it hard to believe no other companies are making them	5
0	this is a piece of garbage the balls deflate after a couple hours the rim is so frail it wo n't hold up to much my friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point i got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking they correctly pointed out that it says slam dunk challenge right on the back board do n't do it it will break when i turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses so that function is worthless the only reason i gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball	5
0	i got my any farm last year happily i opened it and took every thing out in one load i filled out the form and got my ants i decided to slowly put them in outside ! well 15 of my anties escaped and 2 bit me ! ! ! after a good fight with them i got them in and brought them in my finger was burning but the next day i woke up and all my ants had died that night i was soo mad i threw everything away ! sings and skips off	5
0	it 's a pretty good toy but most people get sick of them as they get frustrated and ca n't do every side the same colour on each side if you 're ready for frustration then this cube is for you if you are buyin it then have fun	5
0	i am not too happy with this item it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well	5
0	the fine print on the box tells you this is a multi terrain vehicle instead of an all terrain vehicle this is because while they advertise it to go through sand and grass and mud what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand such as you would find in a desert dry grass such as you would find on the african savannah and dry mud such as you would find in their fertile imagination mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass	5
0	my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise \( which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not \) and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either	5
0	purchased this item for traveling our son does n't travel well so we purchased this item for him and it does n't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows the straps are material and velcro on the ends how do you attach these straps \? so now we just let him play with it being free it does n't attach	5
0	i am so glad we tested this product ahead of time as a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them these walkie talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet' yes i said feet we gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of midlands do n't waste your money on these	5
0	we were very unhappy with this toy the speakers were distored and the music sounded awfu	5
0	my daughter got this for christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the greg character on the keyboard in their defense none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident other than that she seems to like it she also received the accordian and loves it so i would recommend that over the keyboard	5
0	this tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children my son who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn it would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard forget it this is an on pavement toy only	5
0	got a dud lights flash \( constantly \) but not a peep out of it has an email address wrote for suggestions twice also no response but the mail was delivered so i can only assume they 're playing dead \( or playing with one that works \) ! big let down	5
0	this was a cute product but only lasted a day perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag a patch was included but it seems that air is leaking from the seams oh well	5
0	this sudoku yd 638 puzzle is very hard to use and i think of my self as a computer geek to make matters worse the instructions are very poor they may make sense to someone who has used this for years but not to a new user save you money to buy a different game	5
0	i recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years i was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup i was disappointed in the dice tray it is very flimsy and not properly designed it should have a rotator and be made of more durable material also the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals i felt ripped off when i discovered this obvious mistake	5
0	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	5
0	like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all the legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever my son has to sit with it on his lap to play it i would not recommend this toy to anyone	5
0	i bought this for my 2 yr old at a rummage sale he loves it ! but it 's very flimsy the microphone gives constant feedback adn the volume repeatedly resets to a dangerously loud level it was worth the 6 i paid but i would n't recommend buying it new	5
0	my son got this for his 4th birthday moon sand is a terrible toy ugly and messy he seemed to enjoy playing with it \( but no more than play doe \) but the clean up is horrible the sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house	5
0	my daughter received this for her 4th birthday and i must say we were terribly disappointed ! this sand did nothing but make a huge mess of our play room there was dust everywhere and nothing the kids tried to make stayed together ugh ! as it is sand when it gets on the floor there is no way to easily pick up the pieces except with a broom or vacuum we put it on newspaper to contain the mess but boy was that a mistake wet newspaper and dry sand we 're going to take it back and get some good old fashioned play doh instead	5
0	this product kept my 5 and 3 year olds' attention for ten minutes tops it does not look like the pictures in the ads it usually got stuck in the molds instead of sliding out effortlessly as it would appear in the ad it makes a mess gets all over the place and truly does not seem to be much fun it got put away in the cabinet and my childen never asked for it again my money is better spent on modeling clay or other arts crafts types of activities	5
0	just my opinion but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter 's first leap pad she loves maurice sendak 's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo 24mo age range i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system as for the pooh bear game i agree way too easy here this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children and made a more challenging one for this level great idea just not well put together	5
0	of all the first leappad books to buy make this the last one on your list my daughter has no interest in this one whatsoever ! 60 br 62 60 br 62 \( i have two friends who have said the same thing	5
0	i was really upset when i received this item i had ordered 2 becasue i thought it was a terrific deal but nowhere did it mention that you needed the leappad player in order to use it i hate returning things	5
0	i got this for my eight year old unfornately i read the reviews on amazon just before he opened it not before i bought it this is a great idea very poorly implemented i am completely dissappointed and if i had not bought it at a final clearance sale would be bringing it back my son 's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper	5
0	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i cannot tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could	5
0	the game of course is great fun but the 3 d is not worth the extra cost the kids get distracted by the slides and ladders and do n't play the game they fight over which direction the marble should move \( and of course marbles get lost easily \) how to count the spaces is not obvious i would just get the good old classic game if i had it to buy over again	5
0	the figure was sent back for a replacement because the legs did not fit into the body it was defective the same problem with the replacement and it was returned as well	5
0	the rechargeable battery lasted for approx 5 minutes once fully charged after five minutes it did not have enough power to allow the air hog to fly i would not recommend this as a buy	5
0	this is the first time i'm writing a review of anything on amazon com but i need to warn people about this game it would be great except for 2 problems 1 it skip excessively 2 there is no way to easily skip past games that you 've played so once you 've taken out that dvd put it back in and you 'll recognize the questions you 've answered them already ! not recommended if i could give it negative stars i would however amazon makes you give it at least 1	5
0	i got this product for my daughter the password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize my daughter often could not make the journal open after a frunstrating week or two she stopped playing with it altogether	5

0	my son was excited to get this for christmas after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed the arrows launcher never held the arrows as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet	5
0	we are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer we constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and i do n't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it not recommended	5

0	the paint brushes are so stiff that they do not even catch the paint when you dip them and then they do not bend to meet the paper they poke the paper i threw them out after one use	5
0	this toy barely gets used in our house it has a very low to the floor design my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it the sounds and characters are cute but clunky and not very realistic i am very dissatisfied with this purchase not worth the investment if you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster i would suggest checking out fisher price my first dollhouse it has a higher design with more realistic characters not so clunky i wish we would have purchased this one instead	5
0	i just recieved a fisher price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice christmas gift i was thinking that amazon would have a good price but they are almost double what fisher price is asking if you go to fisher price 's website this item is only 33 00 7 95 shipping and handling	5

0	my 10 mo old son showed no particular interest in this table i did not like it much either why would a 10 mo old show any interest in table items that sing \? i have left it without legs two minutes after i installed the legs my son nearly fell with the table on his face had to uninstall them not good for active infants also not very entertaining buy the one from leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this \( might have more balance though but i do not know for sure \)	5
0	our 7 yr old daughter was given this last christmas it is awkward to use and the motor did n't seem to have the power needed to turn the wheel when the clay was on it she ended up using the clay and molding it by free hand it now sits in the corner of her activity table and is n't used at all	5

0	i had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when i saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face evidently the box had been vrooming vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward my two year old has largely lost interest in this toy he does n't mind the shaking and noise but more often than not it just vrooms and then does n't go anywhere my advice buy matchbox or hot wheels or something more reliable with volume control this will probably be in our next load of donations thrift shoppers beware	5
0	this product is awful it wo n't stay together and is very frustrating to both myself and my three year old what a disappointment	5

0	we bought this item for our son 's birthday we assembled it exactly as shown in the directions the cars do not launch properly into the loop we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track also when you place cars to launch and crash they shoot clear across the room one knocked our daughter in the chest ! not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with hot wheels items	5
0	i have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it i found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses also i would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number i do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers but i could n't even see those still searching	5
0	we gave this toy to our 4 year old son that was 1 1 2 years ago it worked at first but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit after about 1 month the balls did not pop up at all little tikes replaced it with a completely new toy again it worked for a few months but now it does not work the beeps sound \( a nice feature \) but nothing happens my son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t ball stand most of the balls are lost thank goodness i only paid 10 for this on sale but not even worth that much	5

0	okay the concept of this game cube is great and believe me you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle now on to the reality i first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out upon its first release the stickers stayed on the plastic squares did n't break off and it just seemed like a higher quality piece i beleive the plastic might have been heavier but now twenty years later the stickers peal off the squares pop out junk junk junk ! if this was made in the usa it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas however it would n't be junk you get what you pay for stephen john becciaauthor of the treelanders	5

0	at first the case seemed like a good idea but after the third use the zipper stopped working because the case does not stay open on its own there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart after fixing it a couple of times it is now permanently broken bad design perhaps velcro would have been better here	5
0	this is a very cute and realistic set the measurements are all accurate the whisk is very dangerous though it is metal one of the things came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away if you buy this item make sure get rid of the whisk !	5

0	i bought this kit solely for the prism to show my kids how the light split into a rainbow the prism is such poor quality plastic that the light does n't even go through it correctly i could have made a better prism in my oven with plastic pellets and a form the sides look like a cake top that fell causing the light to not go through it correctly the rest of the kit sucks too i put batteries in the flashlight and the plastic of the flashlight cracked and crumbled in my hand ! the cardboard cutouts are ok if you want to pay lots of bucks for cardboard cutouts and the included soda straw	5
0	this stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers it 's good for older kids who can keep their fingers on the paper but not good for little ones who smush their fingers into the wax and get it all under their finger nails on the table chairs and walls	5
0	although crayola is a wonderful brand i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them and they get frustrated it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture also it is not mess free the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch \( other than paper \) anyways i did not like how mushy the paint was i am still finding globs of it everywhere	5

0	i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side boards which is very dangerous for kids i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson 's wagon which i purchased for his 2nd birthday he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off	5
0	this product arrived with none of the hardware needed to assemble the table itself looked as if was used or returned for being substandard all in all not a good experience i will not purchase anything from this seller agai	5
0	after reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble we were very disappointed the packaging arrived torn and open in several places only a few screws came with the table not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too the parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund	5
0	as far as i know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat no matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different this was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for christmas and now she hardly plays with it it entertains our 15 month old twins more ! resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else a cd boombox maybe	5
0	purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren this is boring and absolutely no fun no matter what your age i guess for almost 40 you should n't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting does n't even deserve the one star i gave it	5
0	followed all directions added fish within hours the fish were sleeping on the bottom of the tank luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water added fish 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better something is seriously wrong with this tank bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what they are doing great ! do not put fish in the shark tank they will die	5
0	my 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank two goldfish two flushes if i take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around but they wo n't last 24 hours in this tank i 've followed the directions to a t adjusted the ph tried lights on lights off pump on pump off even used bottled water but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank	5
0	i bought this toy for my shark crazed 5 year old she was so stoked and we prepped the tank added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish less than 24 hours later they were dead repeat 40 hours later same story we tried a single betta frank but less than 4 days later he 's dead we do n't know what it is the water was tested it 's fine we think it is the overall design of the tank could the tight fitting lid be responsible \? possibly ammonia by product buildup from the fish \? who knows but we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin	5
0	i agree with the comments about the taste and size personally i think someone should look into the false advertising on the preztel kit which is also a 4 pack you only get two pretzels one of the packs is salt and another is glaze then you get two packs of some pretzel dough these pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine total rip off hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff	5
0	the go cart is much smaller that it appeared to be my 2 year old barely fits these is no reverse and it is a sit in toy so the child has to get completely out to turn around or you have to follow them around the steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight all together it is not a very impressive to my daughter enjoys it very much but i should not have got rid of her lil' quad	5
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas his eyes lit up when he saw it he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away we did n't of course we waited a whole day thank goodness it literally took an hour to put together there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different it was very frustrating then it would n't stay together once it was finished it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since he gets so upset when he tries to play with it we saved the box it 's going back if they will take it	5
0	santa got this castle for my five year old son for christmas i agree with many of the other reviewers though it is visually appealing it is very flimsy and was painstaking to put together despite all that my son seems to be enjoying this toy is fun for the child but not for the parents	5
0	my son loved the toy and could n't wait to get it opened but the problem came when we tried to close it back up the treasuer box would not close back up easily i had to work at it very hard my son who is 7 could not close it by himself he got pretty frustrated	5
0	this thing just does n't work do n't bother it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it looks like it would be fun if it worked the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason	5
0	i was very excited about buying this phone for my daughter after seeing it on the internet that was until i saw it in the store there were about 5 in stock and not one of them was in full working condition most of them had not enough power to play any sounds while others had parts broken off of it do n't waste your money on this product you will surely be disappointed	5
0	not to impressed with this company 3rd item i have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed also the table top had major horizontal cracks i do n't believe they check their quality of their products	5
0	my twins loved the similar toy i bought at dollar tree the one at dollar tree has a duck or pig in center instead of a red mass i cannot believe they charge this much for the same thing	5
0	last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use the water squirt function quit working after only a week my kids loved them but for the price these cruisers are they need to be built to last	5
0	yes i 've just bought the videonow color fx and want more pvd 's but they are kinda costly so i want to know is ther a need to buy this item \? can you burn regular dvd 's to a pvd \? and is this going to be a wast of money \? is there any were to buy blank pvd'	5
0	i ordered this item and was so excited it loaded fine it let me upload files just fine it was n't until i actually tried to create my pvd that i received errors that shut down the program \( many many many times with numerous types of video files \) i double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine the worst thing is that there is no support for the media player i tried contacting hasbro with no response i am so dissapointed	5
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games it is basically boring and ill conceived i have played it a few times with my kids and found it to be of no particular interest on any level it is neither fun exciting or challenging for them or me i strongly recommend you try a cranium game or how about chess \? \? \? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game is that it 's better than tv which is n't saying much	5
0	i bought this item for my 6 year old niece not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked \( colors were not bright like other cars toys \) i was absolutely disgusted with the name calling in one of the sayings i realized when it called the tractor a negative name stupid i believe it was that it was going back i would n't want my child having a toy that calls others names so i wont give it to anyone either not to mention the grammar used is not correct i realize that is the character but why would i want to teach children grammer that is wrong \? all in all disapointment that disney puts out toys like this	5
0	it 's a big nasty mess as big of a mess and disappointment as floa	5
0	the remote worked only for 2 days my daughter loves the look of it so i am not able to dispose it off its a total waste of money i wish i had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote	5
0	i agree with a previous review this ball pit will not stay inflated ! my kids had barely played with it and it started tearing and getting small unrepairable holes in it this is also a very small ball pit it is too small for two kids to easily play in it and not bang heads we had purchased a little peoples ball pit train years ago for my older daughter and it held up for years this was a very disappointing purchase	5
0	it did n't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots do n't waste your money	5
0	my daughter had this when she was a teenager now my grandchildren come and play the game she had to preserve the original game i ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it the grandchildren all 6 of them love playing this game at our house	5
0	my daughter loves this toy she has the treehouse and the school house she plays with them often my only complaint is that they fall apart she does not mind i just snap it back together and she keeps playing	5
0	this toy is a terrible disappointment it falls apart immediately is very poorly designed and ridiculously difficult for a child \( or adult \) to put together	5
0	whoever decided this was good for four year olds must not be a parent of said age group my four year old received this as a birthday present his adult aunt could barely figure it out it 's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring we have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it even though we have the corresponding mystic force power rangers themselves i think this toy should be perhaps 1 4 of the price listed simply disappointing	5
0	it really is not what i was looking for but the children have found other uses for it	5
0	i paid over 7 for this thing bought it thinking it was going to be bigger than the ones that come with the set and then i get it and it is tiny ! you can get a much better deal on the extra large ones at lego co	5
0	bought these beads for my 18 month old he enjoys taking them in and out of the container they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved	5
0	horrible i was very excited to play this as i am a huge fan of the arcade game of course i was n't expecting the quality to be the greatest but i was hoping for something playable track ball is stingy graphics are atrocious and there is only one course to play i have played better functioning playable golf games 20 years ago on an pc the idea was great but this just was n't made well do n't waste your money on this	5
0	this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart the archways do not stay on them too expensive for what you really get i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats i would not buy it	5
0	the game was not nearly as sturdy as i had hoped a piece broke off as i was putting it together too sensitive to touch would n't purchase again for an 8 year old	5
0	how annoyed am i \? today my son is 5 an aunt bought the tmnt monster jam truck so we supposedly bought the battery to go with it wrong this does not go with it son has a toy with no battery we have a battery with no toy well done toys'r'crap will never buy here agai	5
0	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas i would have sent it back if it had not been from santa	5
0	unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship this toy is a complete waste of money my son had been wanting the black pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him buyer beware	5
0	my 7 1 2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend 's house yesterday she had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt after a trip to the er and the orthopedic surgeon she has a fracture in her growth plate need i say more	5
0	this elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night i had to ship the first one back to fp on my own dime to get a new one that one was broken as well ! the cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the abc part does not work this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on ! what a pain ! shoddy electrical work i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat make sure you get this garbage on sale !	5
0	we bought this for our snowboarding 11 year old son being used to playstation and gamecube he was n't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky it 's a cool concept but it needs more time in development	5
0	my 3 year old got this for a christmas gift and i thought it to be a great idea since he loves elmo and bathtime wrong the darn crayons stained my bathtub ! ! i had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains almost out i threw the crayons away after that my son likes the elmo still but i would n't recommend the crayons especially in an older style porcelain bathtub like ours	5
0	i bought this toy last year for me son he really did not care for the toy at all but he loves elmo the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast	5
0	i bought this for my boyfriend as a present we both love the tv show and thought the game would be as exciting \( without the live crowd of course \) but the game moves slow no models only picking case numbers you can compete against one another but its not really exciting maybe you should try the board game version it ca n't be any worse	5
0	game did n't work but amazon was very accomodating with a refund including shipping	5
0	remember spirograph by kenner you played with as a kid \? this thing hasbro sells under the same name is not that toy it is obviously of cheap quality parred down to a handful of gears and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work ! stick with the original which means purchase it used on ebay but do not buy hasbro 's spirograph	5
0	this is nothing like the spirograph i grew up playing with as everyone else mentioned the gears are much too thin and slip constantly my 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws do n't waste your money !	5
0	i purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present i was significantly disappointed with this item having the smithsonian name on it i expected better construction while trying to assemble the item the plastic cracked on the one the tubes and caps were so loose that i was afraid the bugs would get out into my house i put silicone around the extremely loose ones however i did not seal everything so the critters could breathe for the price there are other similar items out there with better construction	5
0	my daughter has the ethnic version of this doll she absolutely loves it however as a parent i notice that the color on the lips are peeling and the doll cheeks has no color to them like the illustration i am also very upset that i can not get a replacement for this item how do you tell your daughter that santa claus ca n't fix or replace this item \?	5
0	what a waste of monee i do not think this is a nice gift for anyone boo the en	5
0	i bought this dollhouse for my daughter 's 3rd birthday within the first week i had to glue at least 3 pieces of furniture back together over the past year i 've repaired numerous pieces and the house cannot be moved without the back and roof coming off \( it is now taped together \) for 150 and with all of it 's awards i expected much better quality i think alex needs to stop selling this house and redesign it	5
0	very cheaply made my children broke it after only four months the back wall broke off along with the top roof the furniture also broke the people 's hair came off this house was a big mistake i wish i had purchased a different one this house is very cute but not sturdy enough for preschoolers	5
0	this says it is a wooden dollhouse but is not worth the money is cheesy looking and cheaply made	5
0	my 10 year old received the massively mini media player for christmas and she and i both are very disappointed in it there is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our napster files \( at least not readily perhaps i could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and then transfer them to the mini media player but i have not tried that yet \) folks 128mb is a joke even for a young child there are much better players out there in the same price range i own the sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and i am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well	5
0	i purchased this for my 8 year old for christmas and thought i would be able to store more than just a few songs but the memory capacity is actually only 109m and will actually only hold about 8 10 songs no where near the 2 hours promised i would not recommend this purhcase to any child	5
0	this looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself how they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it	5
0	i bought this toy for my son for christmas i thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is so loud ! it scares him everytime i turn it on and there is no way to control the volume i know lots of kid toys are loud but i have never heard one as loud as this one	5
0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	5
0	i do n't know why this is but when i put on the dale sr shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls	5
0	it sucked because i couldnt figure out the screen it is really big so you cant relly hide it any where and you cant drop it because it will break really easily trust me i kno	5
0	i bought two of these as christas gifts one for my son and one for my nephew my kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and i are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash not only does this stuff look like sand but it gets into everything just like real sand the play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess on top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well all and all i would reccomend this product only for childeren over 8yrs and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up	5
0	we were really excited about this item but have been very disappointed we followed the directions exactly even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks \( which was frustrating and a pain in the neck \) and still we have nothing growing after weeks and weeks of waiting ! rotten thing to do to a kid ! the plastic dome is of decent quality and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller worked out much better this is a total waste of time and money unfortunately	5
0	unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including mr do and do it right the classic collections on playstation ii are the best unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play the monsters in the pac man games are almost always on kill including following you in the tunnel a lot of the time the problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate galaga was better and mappy was a lot of fun to play the most underated classic in arcade history but again it 's better to get the collections for playstation ii	5
0	the doll is a great gift for little girls who love dolls my 6 year old loved the doll i do not like the way allysens hair sheds when you comb it when allysen asked when is your birthday \? my daughter had to keep repeating herself when allysen asked what is your name the same thing happened so my daughter got stuck with happy new year as her birthday and sweetie as her name when you ask allysen to read her book she asked for a smoothie she is also very loud my daughter slept with allysen and carried her around everywhere she went when allysens batteries died she went back in the box	5
0	another reviewer said that this was a soft doll with no hard parts i ordered it thinking it would be perfect for my niece what i got was a hard plastic doll with small pieces labeled not for children under three needless to say i was very disappointed this would be great for a 4 or 5 year old but do n't expect a soft cuddly doll for your little one	5
0	this does not work for the coler pixter there is no port to plug it in	5
0	i bought it for my son to use with the original pixter also and i found what it was compatible with after i realized that it did n't work with the original pixter the box i have says down in the bottom right corner \( if the back of the box is facing you \) of the back of the box in tiny print compatible with pixter plus and pixter 2 0 you would think they would put that on the front	5
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5
0	i thought this would be fun but ended up in garbage after 2 days fighters dont stay in place and dont really move well very hard to hit at other playe	5
0	dude this looks cool but plays crappy pretty cheap plastic mechanics are lame you cant really tell when superman is hit because his head barely leans back you have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets and it seems rigged that supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth justice and the american way again cool figures weak cheap playability	5
0	my 10 year old son got this for his birthday the screws are so deep inside the ball we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out \( the ball wo n't bounce anyway ! \) even then the screws would not come out ! the lightup goal is great but the ball is ridiculous use your old nerf balls and then it 's okay	5
0	my wife and i were not impressed with the caterpillar tunnel the material was flimsy and light weight the tunnel is small and our children \( even our 1 year old \) could n't crawl through it without making the toy twist and roll over since it was not what we expected we decided to return it and get our money back	5
0	i bought it for my 1 and half son he likes it but seveal days after he had it it broken i dont know why just no music he doesnt like it any more	5
0	i recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint i thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it wo n't be messy although all this is true both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube if this is made for children should n't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it	5
0	while the concept is good there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds i would avoid it to be honest	5
0	rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales he is shamed into giving them to everyone sounds like a communist primer	5
0	bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily the level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it my only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages \( for the spiral binding \) the pages tend to be separated there so i think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength	5
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of this product i had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit the second kit also had the same problem both kits had to be returned it is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit	5
0	my sone received this as a gift and was very excited about it at first but as another reviewer mentioned it quickly becomes frustrating if you do n't follow the directions exactly after a few minutes he gave up and moved on i finally donated it to charity with my son 's blessing and this is a kid who saves everything	5
0	my 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was ok with us he did however run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped the legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play one of the legs broke because of that the spider cannot walk now ! too bad because its looks great we are going to send it back	5
0	i could n't wait to play this game i 've been a fan of snl for over 20 years i was sooooo disappointed with this game the questions are horrible ! they are difficult to read and undestand the only good thing about the game is the fact that the game pieces are cool otherwise save your money it 's not worth the booo hisssss to the creators of this game ! you ripped off your biggest fans ! ! !	5
0	in order to answer the questions in this edition of trivial pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of snl most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family who have watched snl since it began and who quote it frequently i was very disappointed in this game	5
0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses even though we purchased it as a play bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams	5
0	i ordered 200 hundred of these and half of them were squashed by the time i received the shipment and you ca n't get the shape back if you want good quality balls spend your money on the playhut version	5
0	these balls did not retain there round shape from the minute my 2 1 2 year old daughter played with them the balls have that smashed in appearance and you cannot get them back to the original shape i purchased these balls to add to the ball playland made by the moose mountain toymakers ltd that i purchased for my daughter for christmas the balls that were included with the ball playland have retained their shape unlike the balls i purchased separately	5
0	compared with the sound sensation blocks i bought together to my 3 month babies this product is almost ignored by them	5
0	very disappointed with the quality took 2 hours to put together then disintegrated as i was carrying it from the shop to the christmas tree i was not happy having to put it back together early christmas morning be prepared to use extra tape glue nails and screws to hold the contraption together the stairway is a joke and i threw it away as it is only held in with two 3 4 pegs we 'll see if it survives christmas day	5
0	without my husband being handy this would have been in the trash on dec 26th took almost 2 hours to assembly with these small wooden pegs that barely held the unit together it fell apart when my daughter was playing with it on christmas day and so my husband improvised with stronger screws to hold it together though she loves playing with it we need to find out where we can purchase the furniture that the picture shows \? \?	5
0	my daughter had her tamagotchi v4 for about a day when the screen did n't work anymore at first we thought it was the batteries but once we changed them i knew that was n't the problem it would beep and make noise but you could n't see anything in the screen	5
0	this deck stunk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! that is of course if you did n't find the combos i have won tons of tournaments with my exodia deck once i entered a tournament with this i found alot of combos i deafeted two guys with it i'm not using it again it was pretty good but hey that 's a starter deck for you	5
0	this is really the dumbest thing ive ever seen yu gi oh is such a rip off get something good anime princess chick age 1	5
0	not the best toy i own i wanted to send it back after a week because the letter c would n't say it 's name after a while it started working but then d stopped according to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute mine never have done this my son likes this product and uses it as a parent i am disappointed in the quality	5
0	this game was not engaging my son did not find it interesting he has not asked to play with it again you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance try what 's gnu it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults	5
0	the fan would not inflate the item we ended up putting tissue paper in it to look like it had muscles not good at all a great disappointment	5
0	dont waste your money on this one the picture is cute but the quailty of the toy isnt any good the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child the concept is supposed to be like the game memory your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting your better off just buying the real memory game the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price	5
0	the description did n't say that the board game was sold separately i assumed a game pack had all the necessary materials it should hae said expansion pack it did n't so i had to go buy the original game it should n't be called wb 50th anniversary it should be called scene it friends version we played one full round with 2 teams and literally half of the questions had to do with the friends tv show all in all i was very disappointed with this product	5
0	it has a lot of background noise so you have to set it high to hear the baby	5
0	very disappointed this item never got shipped to me we waited close to 2 months to find out it was n't coming	5
0	good luck getting this bed ! i ordered it 5 months ago \( with availability being 2 4 weeks each month i was told it will available next month i finally cancelled my order and purchased the little tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr old outgrows a toddler bed kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill	5
0	the bed looks very nice when you have a toddler who is starting to climb out of their crib this probably wo n't make it in the reviews but i'm writing it anyway	5
0	this game is a clever combination of uno and rummykub very entertaining and can be played with kids as well as adults it allows me to add my own special rules to make it more interesting if you like cards you 'll love this game	5
0	i bought this toy for my son \( the boy 's version \) for his 2nd birthday it was fun for a few days until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard the toy landed on top of him with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy he was so terrified of it after that he refused to get back on it has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale save your money this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering	5
0	bought this for my 6 month grandson worked about 1 week then quit have changed batteries but still does n't work guess it was too good to be true ! spend your money on another crib toy	5
0	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed now the darn thing does not respond to her answers even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock much more fun	5
0	i hate this doll ! she is difficult to program eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached within a week her hair was a matted mess it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided i would not recommend this doll to anyone with all the frustration this doll has caused i would love to turn it into a shooting target	5
0	my daughter wanted a sewing machine for her 8th birthday i thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine but it was a mistake because the singer lockstitch sewing machine only worked once when we first tried and this was it i tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it does n't work more than once unfortunatelly by the time we realize i could not return it because the box was in the garbagge it is just a big waste of money do n't buy it	5
0	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew and how to thread both top and bobbin threads my daughter received this machine for christmas we threaded it according to directions it sews about 10 stitches then jams i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing and leads to a jam every time do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this	5
0	some of these reviews are amazing seems rather professional to me in most cases these are just brine shrimp people feeder shrimp for most fish you want to learn how to keep a pet buy one you want to learn how to grow food for it to feed off of then this is the starter kit it 's not a pet it 's a food	5
0	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
0	my son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift however one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that it is poor quality and construction do n't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind most kids would break this the first time	5
0	i think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush but i immediately encountered some problems with the toy that i think are worth mentioning first the battery box is very poorly designed once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog 's tummy it 's nearly impossible to keep it closed again the dog 's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open now if i handle the toy the box keeps falling out ! my second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad the sounds quality is poor and it does n't always sound like a dog	5
0	my son received this as a christmas gift he and his brother and dad were excited got all set up to build it and got nothing but frustration ! these are really mechanically minded guys too very disappointing i was especially surprised because of the smithsonian name on it you 'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it my guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled the screws stripped and we did n't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue it simply would not assemble the way it was advertised i am calling amazon tomorrow about a refund	5
0	i bought this identical bed at toys r us for 175 00 this person is ripping people off do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs	5
0	we usually love all the melissa and doug toys but these sound puzzles are disappointing i bought two for christmas the farm one and the vehicle one we could n't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle \( as the other reviewer said \) and for this farm one the sound quality is so bad ! the animal sounds are n't even recognizable in some cases the puzzle itself is fine but i would n't recommend paying extra for the sound	5
0	i did n't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise then it worked just fine the instructions do n't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards but once you get it lined up right it works fine with hershey 's syrup a great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader	5
0	not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies pretzels strawberries etc but it does n't even warm up the syrup so like someone else said you may as well fill up a bowl with hershey 's syrup and let the kids dip away the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this they thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate	5
0	this product is a waste of money after the lightbulb goes out and the lighbulb did n't last very long in the first place polyconcept does not make the lightbulbs available in the stores after numerous phone calls to polyconcept \( manufacturer \) i have yet to receive replacement light bulbs ! ! ! so basically it is now useless	5
0	i have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept i have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept the lines are blurry there is no focus to begin with but the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base whenever you move it touch it etc the dry erase markers do n't erase from the board and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it i ca n't fathom buying a new light bulb at 4 95 s h after a total hour of use in two sessions i think it 's probably wiring who knows but it 's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage	5
0	my daughter received this for her third birthday from her grandpa and while it 's a great concept and i think she would really like it it does n't really work erasing each drawing is nearly impossible and it bothers me enough that i know it will bother her to be unable to erase old drawings and start new so we 're returning it for something else	5
0	wow ! this toy was made as cheap as possible shame on crayola for not spending the extra pennies to make this more durable and a better quality product great concept but poor designers ! steps aside crayola your name does n't stand for much anymore !	5
0	the pieces of this toy \( the outfits etc \) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet also the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing in general this toy is hokey and cheap i recommend melissa and doug 's magnetic dress up and ormagnetic princess dress up all the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together also the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized	5
0	if you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in ! also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet they are made with known cancer causing chemicals they are also manufactured over seas wher the deq epa etc have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers my two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers benzene poly vinyl chloride all kill the liver	5
0	i bought these slippers after reading these reviews thinking they are really cute how bad can they smell \? well let me tell you on christmas morning they lasted about 20 minutes in the living room before they were thrown outside on the porch and they were back at the store 2 days later being returned the smell is beyond awful and is absolutely unbearable as cute as these slippers are for your princess do yourself a favor and get something else these are horrifying	5
0	our daughters are four and five years old the skates will not fit over our five year old 's shoe the ad clearly says three to seven years old	5
0	bought this little cooler for the back of our atw wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well but this a totally soft sided cooler with no frame or supports so if there is anything in it the cooler does not hold it 's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon looks terrible and i would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin	5
0	purchased this for our grandchildren it did not work ! unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging so i assumed that it could not be returned it gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered	5
0	lego is a great product unfortunately this one 's just a little too ambitious my son fell in love with this and begged for it for chanukah but once we got it put together it would n't stay together to play with it 's great to make smaller planes with but the original plane just fell apart under it 's own weight	5
0	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1 2 years \( unless small for their age \) my 4 yr old son \( 36lbs \) got it for his birthday and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car but its been parked since broken i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted the plastic seems cheaply made the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well stickers have already started to flake peel off after 1 month consider a bigwheel	5
0	the concept is perfect it is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay the pedal mechanism is difficult to master but doable the steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns i rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it it most likely was a returned item it was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled i fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well the product is very cheaply made but the sound effects and look is perfect for a batman lover i have written to etoys and i will see how they respond my sons loved the car nevertheless	5
0	this item had a description for ages three and up this is n't even close now i'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five year old who is so attached to the fact it 's a batmobile he can get in even if his knees practically knock at his chin that i 'll never pry it from him he 's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months it was a complete waste of money it 's suited for two to three year olds and small four year olds	5
0	our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age yet the batmobile is much too small for him for a kid who loves batman it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination but after just 2 or 3 days he gave up and returned to his tricycle as a result except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it the batmobile has been a waste of money on the other hand for a child of 3 it should be fun i think for at least awhile	5
0	this was not fun at all boring and she only played with it one time definately a waste of mone	5
0	this toy is not good at all ! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand ! plus it the picture moves thats it ! you have to start all over again its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way trust me i ended up just doing that	5
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short lived it was nearly impossible to assemble the time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils	5
0	my daughter age 9 purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing backpacks etc upon opening and struggling to assemble it we realized that it was useless it is very difficult to use on paper and i can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket i emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard return it to the store you bought it at \( an option i did not feel we had since it had been opened and used \) they should have just said tough luck \( \) save your money avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead	5
0	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago but without the adult 's handle my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself and we generally like the style but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model	5
0	this trike in useless ! our 2yr old tips over every time she tries to ride it buy something that 's worth the money and safer ! now our daughter wo n't go near the thing or any other trike ! i expected much better from radio flyer	5
0	i cannot believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model \( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! \) after some resistance they agreed to refund me and they did the back wheels are too close together making it very easy to tip over plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable i tried it too in the store on smooth ground but on the sidewalk forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !	5
0	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over there is only one good thing about it the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going this helped my daughter learn to pedal the constant nose dive however was not worth it do n't buy !	5
0	i bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her little mommy doll she enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset also at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom the cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it	5
0	i bought this shopping cart for my grandaughters age 22 and 23 months old they love pushing it around without the baby seat without the basket in other words they are quite adept at taking it apart rolling around the frame the doll is difficult to put in the cardboard groceries were put away until they are older the other groceries are fine the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend veggies mac n cheese they both put them in the containers i am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart that my own daughters had that actually looks like a cart does n't disassemble so easily	5
0	after hearing a lot of the songs used for other fisher price music toys i expected the best from this one i liked the songs included on the rom but i expect a nice beat and catchy tune \( like the backyardigans or the doodle bops \) these songs are performed in a dry sort of way they are n't even as good as the wiggles and my kids hate the wiggles it was a bit disappointing	5
0	this vehicle is nothing but junk it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a 100 00 toy very disappointed i would like to send it back for a full refund	5
0	i miss happy family i have some i like this doll that im reviewing but mattel tell the happy family fans like me that this doll is not midge	5
0	this game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes also if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again it 's a huge waste of money for 30 00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the dvd or have more than one dvd included in the game this is a big disapointment	5
0	these were a gift to my 5 year old from his grandmother i ca n't return it to her since it would make her feel worse than the worthless product i'm amazed amazon carries them ! a string and two cans would work better	5
0	we bought a pair of these thinking they 'd be an ideal gift for our 4 year old nephew they look great and the hands free styling is nice but it 's a good thing we tested them before wrapping the gift they work terribly we got very flaky reception with a lot of background noise and we were less than 40 feet apart they are promptly being returned	5
0	while the doll is beautiful i do n't think she is a good representation of chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a european her nose also is upturned while some may say that some asians do have rounder eyes most do not and i do n't think this doll looks chinese enough	5
0	i bought this product after pulling numerous items out of the toilet the suction cups never really fit securely to the toilet and after i finally thought i had it right i found the toilet lock floating in the toilet like everything else	5
0	i completly agree with what everyone else said about this do not buy it ! ! ! i wish i had read here first ! ! ! we bought two of them and one stuck for 2 days and the other did n't even last 1 day we tried for days to get them to stick and they just wont we had thrown out the boxes so we could n't even return them ! ! ! i ca n't imagine why they continue to sell them ! ! !	5
0	we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on boy were we wrong ! the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over save your money	5
0	i purchased two of these locks and thought that they were going to work great what a big disappointment they both continued to fall off within 10 minutes of installing them and they continued to fall off i just returned them still looking for something to work	5
0	the first time my husband installed this toilet lock it stayed put for about 3 days i thought it came loose because he did n't wipe the toilet before attaching it i wiped the lock and toilet with rubbing alcohol and assumed the problem would be fixed the lock fell off later that same day now the dumb thing wo n't even stay on for 15 minutes and when i do get it attached my 13 mo old can pull it right off	5
0	this product does not work the way the toilet lock stays on is suction cups they do not suction to the toilet if they do miraculously suction my 18 month old can easily pull or knock it off with the slightest touch i bought two lost the receipts and ca n't return it i would not give this product away because it basically does n't work at all	5
0	my child loves geotrax and plays with them everyday however big city lights makes your track look good but does n't have much for a child to interact the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer unlike other pieces with geomotion this one is a bore my child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the rc trains go under it	5
0	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day upon receipt it was not operable the user is supposed to ask the love ball a question and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid	5
0	this love ball was very un lovely the messages would not appear clearly in the window no matter how i tried turning it over different ways maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before i received it i put it back in the box and plan to ship it back	5
0	since purchasing this executive set i have purchased another one at a local store although both sets are relatively the same the instruction package with my second set is much better the sea monkeys in the executive set lasted about a month and a half this was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague we did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them the instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months i believe the executive set is overpriced as well	5
0	we went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water adding the package of sea monkeys and finally feeding the sea monkeys and nothing happened \( \) hope these are not dead	5
0	this is a cheaply made over priced product it did n't last a week and i paid over 30 dollars for it and since i ordered it early as a christmas gift i ca n't return it because it has been over 30 days ! ! the drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way therefore the coins fall to the bottom get stuck etc total waist of money that i now cannot get back !	5
0	this sorter is very light duty it jams frequently and unless the coin tubes are perfectly round the coins do not enter them squarely i can not recommend this coin sorter i am looking for a better quality sorter	5
0	this toys purpose is to sort your change and it performs poorly in mine the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one which takes forever if you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins in mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it it no longer works	5
0	the handle falls off easily so its not good for a young toddler learning to walk the seat is very wide so unless your small kid has legs as long as a grown up kid its not going to be comfortable the wideness does help with the balance of it for a child that would be pushing it but the handle popping off kind of defeats that purpose	5
0	it has lot of problem most of time it 's cartridge will not be recognozed by leap pad	5
0	if you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone not the microhpone with these two books if you purchase this item then you are limited to these two books ! ! if you purchase the microphone you can use all microphone enhanced books ! ! ! my kids love the microphone it is great to hear their own voice and sounds i give the microphone itself 5 stars	5
0	this game was not at all what i expected the steering wheel and pedals are just for looks you actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel and many of the games had nothing to do with driving so glad i opened it to try it before christmas morning this is one toy that is headed back to the store	5
0	i thought baby would be much more interested in this it 's colorful and easy to grab but for some reason it 's a non starter	5
0	i recieved this itema s a gift i thought it would be great i was wrong ! the designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5
0	i bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister the skates are good overall they are easy enough to put on and take off the padding inside is nice the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting	5
0	i bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago it is designed for the sandbox but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts it also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out but my kids love to ride around on it it 's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed	5
0	a great idea in theory but i think this is a very poor design the wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place they just spin around and around i will be able to get it working with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house but if i had given this to a child for christmas i would feel awful about it	5
0	this is a wonderful toy i have given it as a gift many times but this toy did not quack ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the child was very disappointed \( so were the rest of us \) it was returned the experience was very bad	5
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday he loved it ! but after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it he still plays with it a little bit but not like when it made noise i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month	5
0	my 4 yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just does n't do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one	5
0	my daughter loves strawberry shortcake this interactive doll and book are uninteresting and do not work together very well the book has to be on a flat surface and then still does not work well the doll and book quickly became seperate toys and neither are played with very often	5
0	i agree with the other people who wrote a review ca n't figure out the sequence of events or maybe stylus does not work child not happy and tired of hearing shortcake say the same thing over and over save your money and buy a good book for your kid ! !	5
0	my son received this car for christmas it worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the off position when we were done the batteries would die each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries ! the last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it wo n't work so now it 's garbage !	5
0	i was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway it was a lot of fun ! while it worked we experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here i appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to \? it 's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it i would not buy it again if you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first	5
0	we bought this for our 10 month old son for christmas he really enjoys it but the steering stripped out within the first week so he can only go straight we have to follow him around and turn it other than that it 's been a good buy he can play with it inside and out he 's 16 months old now and will be getting a bigger faster 12 volt 4 wheeler soon	5
0	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump	5
0	it sucks it breaks easy and does n't work good dont waste your money like i di	5
0	it says that it works with vibration maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline the kids are not really that impressed	5
0	as stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea but it is so small it barely fits my it will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off he gets very frustrated and so am i if i have to re velcro this thing again i am going to scream and he only got it this morning for easter i called fisher price but they are closed for the holiday i plan on calling again tomorrow and i will be getting some sort of refund hey maybe i can score a free field journal haha good luck to you all	5
0	although my 3 1 2 yr old loves this belt it barely fits him it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go in fact my 1 1 2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face my son loves it for the brief time it sort of fits him but i am disappointed with the quality and the size	5
0	i brought this because my kids love spongebob ice cream perfect toy right \? wrong ! the ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob 's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone we have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then i have a huge mess left in the kitchen	5
0	this thing took about 6 hours to build the directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow but i figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor on fresh batteries did n't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently we spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside he looks really cool but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot i love knex but this set is a dud	5
0	not sure what happened but i received my daughter 's gift in the mail today there were no penguins in the box and but the packaging looked original with no tampering beware if you 're ordering from imaginarium ! what a disappointment this was for us	5
0	like all other sy it stops working after a few uses and even when it did work the bubbles were not a plenty people seem content on buying again after it breaks but it would be nice for it to have some durability it is better than blowing the bubbles yoursel	5
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5
0	my title says it all the black balls fell off of the sticks within a couple minutes of normal use therefore the toy was also a choking hazard the balls would n't even glue back on effectively because the ball openings were clearly too large for the sticks they were matched with cheaply made and potentially dangerous	5
0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try i have two complaints with this product one the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone	5
0	we bought these skates for our 5 year old she could barely skate in them they are too big and bulky for children just learning to skate we returned them and have yet to find another pair	5
0	we purchased two of these safes for our daughters for christmas and they both broke within 3 weeks do n't waste your money ! ! ! !	5
0	a torture device disguised as a toy how would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell \? might as well go lick some dirty socks i think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash hey ma why does slinky go down but not up \? who 's the genius who found this at the scrapyard \? most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind 's perverse craving for repetition and or irritation	5
0	as soon as i got it out of the box and put the batteries in it did n't work at all my husband checked it out and we noticed that the plastic was out of place and the little motor fell out of it 's place well my husband clicked everything bak in place and the darn thing still would n't work we returned it the next day and got our money back did n't even bother for a replacement because is so flimsy we were afraid of getting another one just like the first one in all it was a great dissapointmen	5
0	this is a horrible edition of this game it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all save some money and buy the old boxed editions from or get the newest version you 'll like it a lot more	5
0	i have the same review as the rest thankfully we checked it out after we bought it and were able to return it for another model before christmas the remote control lightning mcqueen with the regular controls \( one lever for forward and back another lever for right and left \) was an excellent alternative i would recommend it for any child over about 3 1 2	5
0	i was torn at what remote control car to buy my 4 year old son the sales clerk at the disney store couldn't say enough about this car my son is a huge cars fan i was sold ! ! it never worked it just jerked a little bit ! my 2 year olds fisher price car works a lot better for a third of the price now i got the boys fighting over the baby car and don't even ask for lightning mcqueen i am going back to the store and get my money back do not waste your time on this toy ! ! thank you	5
0	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable the car does nothing but jerk and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it with this in hand march into disney stores and demand \( 1 \) their money back \( 2 \) an apology the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy	5
0	my son waited 8 hours to play with his lighning mcqueen only to be disappointed this thing is way to expense to only jerk around my kitchen floor ! my only hope is i can return this dumpy car because my son tore into the box with excitement ! shame on disney do not buy	5
0	we bought the watch for our 8 year old granddaughter for christmas it ran for about a month then stopped i tried a new battery twice new but no luck cute wristbands nice concept but the watch itself does n't make the grade	5
0	within the first hour of buying this product the second hand broke off and caused the hands not to turn was very flimsy and not well made i would not recommend this product to anyone unless you enjoy dissappointing your children ! ! ! ! !	5
0	while i certainly did n't expect these drum sticks to be whisper quiet i found them to be quite loud for little kids' ears and there was no volume control also i was hoping for a more authentic drum sound that i have found in other toys i returned them	5
0	ok so my daughter was 2 3 4 and not 3 \( toy rated for age 3 \) but she loves elmo and loves playing with this toy it is somewhat loud an there is no volume control also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working rendering the toy worthless also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use so fun toy while it lasts	5
0	as the other reviewers stated it 's difficult for my 5 2 year olds \( their mommy \) to figure out also it 's made of a very cheap flimsy plastic which seems to be the norm for a lot of the hot wheels tracks etc terrible truck with such great potential	5
0	my grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights a month later it was n't working at all we thought it was the batteries and changed them but sure enough nothing was working we called tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them p s i still have n't heard from them and it 's been almost 5 months it 's not worth the money ! i highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lil'firefighter	5
0	i just purchased it for my 3 year old granddaughter for christmas my kids played with it 30 years ago and loved it ! i am so disappointed to read these negative reviews on it now please someone say something good about it ! ! ! i hate thinking that i wasted my ! !	5
0	my kids really liked it until it broke the next day there was nothing we could do to fix it as it had an electronic problem	5
0	we bought this for our kids for christmas of course we open the box on christmas eve at 10pm to put it together and there are no instructions ! it looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them tomorrow morning should be interesting ! merry christmas	5
0	my daughter loved this toy but the microphone stopped working within a week of using it now we are shopping for a wireless microphone	5
0	the microscope never worked at all it is cheap plastic and very badly made you get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the microsope very disappointing the discovery channel kits are better value do n't waste your money on this kit	5
0	extremely disappointing bought the toy for my son for christmas it did n't come with the battery \( 30 extra \) and the battery is still sold out everywhere including online almost a month later do n't bother there are lots of other great rc toys out there	5
0	it wroke 2 minutes later after openning my husbund try to fixed but surprice all the inside partes are plastic you can`t fixed do not waist your money	5
0	i purchased this for about 20 00 and i followed the directions carefully despite that a coin slipped into the mechanism there was no way to remove it even though i tried that as carefully as possible i threw the device in the trash i did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins and i now separate coins by hand the advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins so you avoid counting them	5
0	i had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me	5
0	i recently purchased this pad set for my 22 radio flyer wagon but had to send them back if you check the radio flyer web site you 'll notice that the 22 wagon sides only have two wide slats when i received this pad set i noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats the loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats since my wagon only has two slats and they are wider the loops were in the wrong spot and were n't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon i'm only guessing but i think these might be for an older model of wagon	5
0	just received my original big wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box i call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing went to the website for faster service after you fill out the information it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging thumbs down until i can get the parts to repair	5
0	my son expected the tie to be maroon and it is definately purple so we were extremely disappointed and returned it ! amazon was very prompt in refunding out money	5
0	this game is so disappointing my nephew loves spiderman he needs fun and subtle cues to stay engaged he was so excited to get this his first lmax cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough we popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games they were not intuitive and then thud he lost interest and has not returned to the lmax since what an absolute waste of money	5
0	i played this at a friend 's party and it was a wretched party game it basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out it is incredibly monotonous and a throughly awful game to play at a party i admire its cleverness it took a lot of creativity and know how to make up these challenging puzzles but for the sake of all your guests i emplore you hide this boring game hide it as well as possible the painful thing is that out of a choice between mad gab and lost the game my friend chose mad gab it 's sad really	5
0	what a disaster it takes too long then you get a tiny gross little blob of cotton candy it is quite a mess to clean then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed my 5 year old wants to know how santa 's elves made such a stinky bad toy expect to be disappointed with this one	5
0	we used the machine once and were disappointed by the performance the second time that we attempted to use it it would n't heat after contacting roseart i was told that i could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement i will probably not bother as it was a lousy product to begin with	5
0	it was neat to be able to make cotton candy at home however the machine only makes a very small amount at a time so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment it takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot then it cools for almost 10 minutes it does n't even come with the sugar needed ! the product should list it on the outside of the box sugar not included ! then you have to clean it \( adult only \) it would not buy it again this review will not mark a 1 for educational value it keeps giving it a 2 and i put a one \( fyi	5
0	i bouht this object and i think i would of rather bought a doll or something i brought it home and it didnt work at all so we returned it and the next one was worse ! ! we folloed all the instructions and the sugar that we poured in didnt stick to the stick even worse the store wont let us return it because they say thats how they all work	5
0	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off parents this machine dosen't work only made with suger thats all it is and also it takes forever \? think before you buy your children will get cavities you will also spend your money on this instead of food or other need	5
0	with five kids under the age of 9 and four leapsters in the house there is rarely a time when someone is n't playing one \( if not all ! \) of them we have about 10 of the cartridges and this was the most disappointing \( followed closely by spiderman \) there simply is n't enough for them to do with it the beauty of the leapster is the ability to interact with the games and learn while they do it watching a video on a 2 inch screen just does n't cut it	5
0	purchased these diapers \( 6 pack \) and was blown awary at the cost took the advice of other reviews and purchased premee diapers try to cut the cost and maybe other moms and grandmas will purchase your product	5
0	battery is way overpriced contact battery store near you ! i did and found this same exact battery type \( 2 6volt batteries \) for much less while there they told me i could use a low amp 12v deep cycle battery instead it did take some time wiring \( fused link is a must \) but is well worth it lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp trickle charge with a amp selectable car battery charger all told it cost me less than 60 for everything it now longer just takes up space	5
0	let 's see you need two different batteries and two different sized screwdrivers so after buying the 9v for the remote control and searching for a long enough screwdriver to open the bus to put in the double as i turned it on honk ! honk ! it 's loud really loud ugh	5
0	my 3 year old has 8 vsmile games and this is his least favorite his top 2 favorite is toy story and winnie the pooh	5
0	i loved the concept of the markers however they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing ! ! the package said that they did n't stain ! i called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including tide with bleach is that one of their subsidiaries \? i was very disappointed	5
0	i agree with the other reviews my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift none of the pieces stay together at all how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together why the horse wo n't stand up why the barn doors keep falling off and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it	5
0	what a super cheap rip off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid '70 's seems like every doctor 's office break room friend 's basement etc had one of these cubes to kill time with main reason that i personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two the colored stickers start to peel off the rubik 's cube had it 's day in this high tech age i cannot see many kids having any interest in this item they might actually have to 'use' their brain please do n't bring back the pet rock	5
0	i bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday he likes it but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it he does not seem to mind because he is so young but as he gets older i do not think this will be one of his favorites i have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet	5
0	this item was not at all what is seems to be the box was the only durable part of the toy i unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 6 years old after seeing them open and what was in the box i was very disappointed	5
0	this pirate chest is a total rip off the chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal when i ordered it as a gift for someone they sent me someone else 's order then refused to let me return my item for a refund when i finally received it the company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all	5
0	this product is a waste of time ! do n't bother the handheld game is entertaining for my daughter but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least ! once connected we walked around the virtual world with nothing to do it is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone there are much better products out there for children that are similar but easier to play with i would suggest webkinz or neopets these 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play unlike the muichiz site ! good luck	5
0	this toy ca n't be unsed unless you go online and update it we have spent countless hours trying to update this toy and ther is always a problem the website is down or some other technical problem then if the website is up you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update so it is unusable ! it is a complete waste of money	5
0	do n't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs we bought the bratz one it thought it was a pawz when we took it online after 10 or so total hours \( yes i know what i'm doing \) fighting it i gave up took it back tech support is a joke there 's nothing in the manual or online help only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time and none of those responses addresses the issue	5
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5
0	the seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed materials workmanship not so hot my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up since there was no taking it back from our 2 year old after he saw it he now has a tent with an extra window in it child is delighted with the toy parent is not delighted with durability	5
0	the parts of this set are not well made light flimsy plastic the highlight of the set the battery operated hairdryer worked for a few seconds and then never again even with fresh batteries i suspect due to poor connection the cover for the battery compartment was badly made and did n't sit well the rest of the items included are nothing to write home about either i bought this for a christmas present for my dd and sent it back for a refund	5
0	the board for this game is a pain half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick it takes forever and a day to look in the book locate the letters' locations and uncover them too i love wheel of fortune but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle	5
0	i do n't know who dark wolf is but he must have shares in the company who makes these mini rubber chickens these are some of the ugliest cheesiest and most poorly manufactured novely items i have ever seen do yourself a favour get something else	5
0	you 'd be crazy to pay this price for a 3 50 toy do n't support the greed of this vendor ! let him sit on these a while and you 'll be amazed how quick the price will drop	5
0	do not buy at this price ridiculous ! ! ! just bought this car on ebay for 8 99 and bought another very rare one \( mr the king \) for 10 00 these sellers are nuts !	5
0	all the above comments are so true ! i ca n't believe the prices on amazon i too have been running back and forth to walmart kohls kb toys trying to get the whole collection i am also missing chick but i wo n't resort to these tactics the normal selling price is 3 99 these sellers should be ashamed ! ! !	5
0	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third party retailers	5
0	for 50 the scanner needs to work consistently we were able to get the orange juice to scan 3 times although we've attempted to scan every item probably a dozen times each not only can a 4 year old not get it to scan but no adult that has tried can get it to scan i can't return this item quick enough without the working scanner i would be just as happy with the 8 generic shopping cart that tru sells	5
0	i recently purchased the magic touch n' crawl pooh as a christmas gift for my best friend 's 7 month old little boy i was so excited to read the rave reviews \( with only one mentioning a mechanical sound \) to my dismay and disappointment when pooh arrived and was started he sounded like a car wreck was occuring every time he turned his head ! i was extremely disappointed and promptly returned him \( i must note that amazon com does make returning a purchase extremely easy \) please be aware of this terrible sound that is much louder than the music that plays when considering purchasing this product	5
0	i hate to write a bad review i think it 's actually the first one i 've ever written this was a gift from my husband 's work christmas party for our 2 year old the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and does n't stay extended so that you can catch the fish it folds back on itself so our son was n't able to catch anything with it it would be better if the extension did n't bend at all but just stayed in one place and even if it did that i would n't buy it it 's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in	5
0	although this new release from barbie looks very much like the real life singer the doll itself is not something i would recommend for a child under 12 the doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly it also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen the short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or mcbride fan	5
0	i bought her because martina mcbride is my favorite singer and then my lil sis gotm madded and she chopped of the head 7 year old	5
0	our family has the original leappad and recently purchased a leappad plus writing i must say that there is no comparison between the two products and the original leappad system is by far superior my kid love playing leappad however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess ! once the pages are written on you can never get them completely clean and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together if we were to do it all over again we would have purchased a second leappad system and not bothered with the plus writing	5
0	i though i hated yu gi oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing weird right \( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable	5
0	this is a great starter deck for any duelist with just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable ! after only a few days of practice with this deck i had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months	5
0	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times our version did not include the 5 ways to play as stated on the box \( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch \) my 4 year old who received the gift lost interest after the first time he played both of my boys love the i spy and can you see what i see books this game just was n't challenging enough for them	5
0	my daughter \( 3 at the time \) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs \( 24 total pieces \) i would avoid this game entirely	5
0	this particular sudoku handheld was not as expected it has only basic functions and the person i purchased for said it is easier just to do sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book really inconvenient functions may be good for young children but not adults	5
0	i bought this for my daughter 's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of chicco happy garden products my daughter loves the little tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter the eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment she would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months it has been completely shoved aside it just does n't rock much i ca n't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it the eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring i would stick to the little tikes set	5
0	this is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips ! how could you make ice cream taste so rotten \? bat barf i say ! ! even if it was good it is much too great of a hassle ! it took my dad over 2 hours to put together and what did we get \? ! a tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top ! i got this hunk of junk 2 years ago christmas it has gathered dust on my shelf ever since !	5
0	i purchase this by the picture inside it shows little closet type places and a bar for hanging clothes none if this is there its cute but i would not recommand this procduct the picture of the inside is false it 's not even close	5
0	thanks to those of you who reviewed this i won't waste my money i too remember the good old days when the clasp was metal and you could load up the case and it stayed shut i 'll stick to plastic tubs that click closed and allow you to see inside too bad barbie mattel is missing a great money maker by going cheap on quality	5
0	i purchased two of these cases for my daughters ages 5 and 7 but we were all disappointed with them it supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in they also come apart everytime the girls open them and they are hard for the girls to put back together they are good for keeping all the little barbie accessories out of the way i just wish they were better quality a friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter \( with a zipper \) and she says it is great but i have not been able to find that item anywhere	5
0	i found this toy to be a waste of money it was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it it says it holds three barbie 's and cloths but then how do you close it	5
0	my cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces however she can not even use the gift you need to buy the totally beadifully jewelry maker to use this kit no where in the online description of this toy on amazon does it tell you this toy is being returned b c we do n't have the bead maker	5
0	all the cut shapes are the same so it 's very easy for my 3 1 2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place the pieces also seem thin and flimsy the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox carrycase all in all the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger the ravensburger thomas giant floor puzzle \( 24 pc \) is a far superior product but no longer complex enough for my kid	5
0	my 7 year old son received the giga ball for christmas it was a big hit he and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours unfortunately the very next day it pretty much fell apart i did n't expect it would last very long but had hoped that it would last more than one day	5
0	what a waste of time to air this up it developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it this was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment the vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks save your money	5
0	this toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow the dozen or so chambers up the instructions were terrible you have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next the chambers do not stay inflated and some do n't work at all my son does still have fun with it but i would n't buy it again	5
0	my son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old he was already much too tall for the toy ! the box advertizes height adjustment which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch however even if he were smaller the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing ! my son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time but quickly lost complete interest in the toy	5
0	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base \( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet \) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time	5
0	my little brother received this toy as a present and constantly had problems just keeping the toy together he barely had any fun with it since it fell apart most of the time my brother is generally good with toys and he has fun with practically anything but this toy proved to be the exception you could buy something much more fun for the same amount of money	5
0	i recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it did n't work ! i contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and i returned it to them i am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them	5
0	anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the autograph card and no memorabilia card you cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens you look and look searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow but no no memorabilia card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles of course the topps company does n't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby ! thanks	5
0	this toy does not work i do not recommend it there is no quality to the workmanship a total disappointmen	5
0	this is not really a practical toy my son gets discouraged because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough it 's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor	5
0	the doll is ok not as good as one expect after seeing it online anyway for 6 \( including shiping \) is worth	5
0	i had to return this product for my son because i could n't get his name which is unique if they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it 's not on the list i mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more if i was a rich person i am sure i could have had one made just for him get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too	5
0	my 5 1 2 year old son received this for christmas he loves pirates and legos so it seemed a perfect fit we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made and it 's very difficult \( even for an adult \) to get the pieces to stay together imagine how frustrating this is for a child we will never purchase mega bloks products again we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration thanks megabloks	5
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew unfortunately it did n't work when it arrived but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine	5
0	the videos are not useable except in the leapfrog leapster i did not know that until i received the order ! thanks alot leapfrog	5
0	the hide n seek care bear really was n't all it was made out to be my kids played with it with my husband on christmas and they all gave up after 5 minutes it was giving out wrong directions and just was n't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek so my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it 's an ordinary stuffed animal an rather expensive stuffed animal	5
0	spongebob is making an obscene gesture personally i do n't think it is an appropriate toy for children anyone that thinks spongebob is merely pointing a finger should n't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society ! !	5
0	it is just like mr potato head except not as many pieces there are n't very many options to dress sbsp but he is always a fun toy after a year of play he is a little torn at the edges but overall in good shape	5
0	i should have paid more attention to the reviews he is top heavy there 's also no way to store the extra parts like mr potato head but i love spongebob anyway and he 's now a part of my collection	5
0	kids played it one time and have n't touched it since bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money	5
0	well the toy just does not perform the way it 's suposed to they do n't fly high in the arena and hardly ever knock eachother out as they are suposed to do very unhappy with product huge disappointment for my 6 and 8 year old sons !	5
0	i purchased the twist shout multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old she has not put it down since she received it however mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices it would only ask the question and then gave the answer she was hesitant to give it up when i explained i needed to exchange it for another this is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time she nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables	5
0	this game is educational because u r asking question`s to other peopleand if thier wrong they hear the anwser anyway so i think u should buy this game because it will teach ur kids alot i wish all u parents and children good luck	5
0	i purchased two of these hand held deal or no deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys the boys found that they had trouble indicating that they 'd like to take the deal when the pressed the button to say yes to the deal the game continued as if they said no deal they got annoyed but kept on playing i tried the game thinking that they did something wrong but i also had the same problem i'm annoyed because the game was 20 each and i think it does n't work properly !	5
0	if you run a spellcaster deck buy the good cards individually because in my opinion i rarely get good cards out of this booster	5
0	education value make friendsuse your brain to thinkhave funadd and subtract durabiliy they can get damaged easilyget sleeves and a deck box the cards this pack intropduces us tounion monsters when you connect them together they get stronger and new effectsspeelcasters cards that go well with dark magician and other spellcasters	5
0	i was anxious to get this game for my daughter for christmas as she loves all princess things unfortunately the instructions were so confusing \( do they even test these games \? with real people \? \) we quickly grew disenchanted with it and tossed it quality is not top notch and the instructions and actual game concept are poorly thought out	5
0	the product shown does not match the description it is not the marble roller coaster kit please fix	5
0	ok maybe that 's a bit strong but this is hands down our most hated toy \( by the adults and the kids are plenty frustrated too \) we received it as a gift \( and wow whoever would pay 35 for this is crazy \) our son is nearly five needs help to load the truck which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming a time consuming procedure since the dominoes have to be loaded one at a time the dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end and are prone to easy collapse after the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear and that 's something i 've never even contemplated before	5
0	the truck gets clogged up often it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load the tower is decent albeit it does n't quite work as advertised as well our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way i grew up in the domino rally days and compared to the original toys these do n't stack up the truck and tower just are n't worth it you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails	5
0	i was very dissapointed with the product it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages i ordered 4 of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them forchristmas we found that they were clumsy to use the sound quality is poor at best and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be whacking on anything and everything as i was led to believe we are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources but i am afraid this is not worth the money if i had opened them before christmas i would have returned them but it was too late so now they are stuck with them	5
0	i had this sent to my little brother and they threw away the packaging before discovering that they recieved a broken unit and of course they did n't tell me in a timely fashion shoddy merch is not cool anything we can do to swap it out is fine but being over 30 days i guess you win	5
0	i bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet \( and never worked again \) very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun	5
0	although these keys are one of my 14 month old son 's favorite toys one of the buttons came off and fell into the shell of the remote control it was the larger button to turn on the light and he would have likey choked on it had it fallen into his mouth if you purchase these be sure to supervise your child playing with them at all times ! however i would suggest not purchasing them	5
0	please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys the plastic ring holding the keys can break we found the small broken piece in our baby 's mouth ! we received this toy only three weeks ago	5
0	mixed low review the single biggest negative is the contrast brightness level of the screen which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions unfortunately that is a huge achilles heal otherwise great electronics features and stylus operation i would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker \( unless there is something wrong with mine which i doubt i would not buy this again	5
0	my children have loved playing in this tent i like it also because it is not huge and does n't take up a lot of room but it is also not made out of very durable material i picked it up to move it out of the way and it ripped it is easy to pop up and down just will probably not have a very long lifetime with kid 's play	5
0	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within 60 seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise	5
0	this item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for 5 8 year olds you cannot return the item once opened so do not order	5
0	i have bought quite a few barbies from amazon recently including the caligirl series fashion fever series and barbie loves micky mouse this barbie is quite different to all above she does not have a rubber skin like others so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts her foot is quite flat only the slippers in this package fit her all other barbies' shoes do not i guess this pooh might be made with the former generation technology	5
0	the tent is extremely flimsy has no bottom to it and falls over all the time it will not stand straight up could have bought a better child 's tent at a cheaper price	5
0	we received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals barns etc he loves the tent however the construction was so poorly thought out that he cannot touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him ! there is no way to anchor it to the floor \( weights etc \) to keep it from toppling over the sides have no stabilization whatsoever the idea is super but maybe they should consider more product testing to ensure its durability	5
0	i was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it the first one that i got did not work at all they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes \( we tried 3 different sets of new batteries \) it is such a great concept but unfortunately is very poorly made i was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life	5
0	if 0 stars were an option that 's what i would have given this awful product does n't work anything like they show on tv so sticky messy and slimy and the smell is just awful i did n't even want my kids to touch it because of the terrible chemical smell i find it hard to believe they can label this product non toxic total false advertising do not buy this mess	5
0	do not waste your money my son was so excited to get floam he had been asking for it for a very long time finally i gave in and bought it it is like little pellets in green slime it is so wet and slimy that it is not possible to mold it into anything and you ca n't stick it to anything like they show in the commercials because once you thouch it it is hard to get the slimy mess of off your hands it is very messy and impossible to play with the commercials are very misleading	5
0	my 3 year old son liked floam because of the goop factor but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a great medium for growing mold this happened to us twice \( despite clean hands work space \) so we gave up on it entirely i suggest you try playfoam instead it 's also available here on amazon or at lakeshore learning store \( look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents ! \) playfoam has a nicer consistency less sticky \( but still moldable \) and no odor	5
0	am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented the wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing the wagon bed absorbs any impacts the parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching there were no scratches and the finsih was nice the pacaging is totally inadequate i would return the wagon if time permitted i am glad that i am not giving it to a child as a gift buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it 's not damaged	5
0	you ca n't be serious we are not in the caveman era you know we have games to play that involve strategy this game is pure luck roll a die roll a die lose it is like playing roulette even blackjack and monopoly have choices there is no way in which a good player can win in this game more often than a bad player as there is no way to be good or bad at this game we have eurogames we have games that involve strategy we do not need this baseless luckfest	5
0	our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it we stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish she was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish the fish was bleeding and died the kids were not very happy i guess this is an okay tank but not great you might want to put only beta 's in it i would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish	5
0	it is a waste of money and a big disappointment i will be returning it	5
0	this machine does not work i will be returning it to find a better first machine for my daughter the stitiches do not hold every instruction was followed to the letter it is not worth even 4 cents much less 14 dollars i would have paid more for something that acutally works i 'll keep lookin	5
0	my daughter was very excited to receive this for christmas until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine it literally would not work anymore i tried everything maybe it 's defective but from other reviews i read i think it 's just a really bad attempt at a great idea too bad she is very disappointed	5
0	i got this for my daughter who will be 10 in feb she has wanted a sewing machine very badly this one is made of cheap plastic and no matter how many times we read the instructions and try to close the end as soon as we remove it it unravels i think i 'd spend more money and get something better as my daughter says it 's very irriating	5
0	these were purchased for my grandson for christmas they are hard to get on clumsy and do n't have the effect they would have you believe he never really used them and a waste of money they were useless and also very dangerous defintely would not recommend	5
0	my daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside she thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage we put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight \( 56 pounds \) but she does n't seem to bounce very high and she needs help getting them on she was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking i would n't tell someone not to buy them but i wish i would have gotten something else for her	5
0	purchased 2 pairs for my 8 9 year old daughters for christmas the shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic the box includes bunches of black elastic bands that you need to really s t r e t c h onto the shoes to provide the bounce the more your child weighs the more bands you use but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks they are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them once assembled the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored they have n't played with them since do n't waste your money	5
0	if you want a beautiful asian doll i just found a couple in ebay under asian berenguer girl doll the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and won't leave home without it	5
0	oh my gosh this is terrible ! my husband and i bought this game because i loved watching this as a child this game uses the same prizes and games over and over if you played once you have played too many times the games are boring the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time i do n't know why the box says 13 and up because my 10 year old daughter could play this this one is going back to the store i got zonked out of my 24 99 if you want my opinion take the cash and run	5
0	save your money because if you buy these for your kids you are going to need your money for the hospital they do not work like you think that would you kid is only bouncing on big rubber bands and fall ever time they try to bounce very dangerous they are n't made for anyone they should be taken off the marke	5
0	at first this case seemed like a good idea but after the 3rd use the zipper broke since the case does not stay open on its own there is tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart after fixing it a couple of times it is now permanently broken bad design maybe velcro would have been better	5
0	this was a fun and very portable toy for my 18 month old son unfortunately the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later also the train easily comes off the track but my son loves playing with the train that way too he 's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet	5
0	dont waste your money i bought a set for each of my kids and they did n't work well the paper that came with the pens was thin and cheap we followed the directions and twisted and it either did n't work or blended for a split second and then back to original color total waste of money they are now in the trash	5
0	do n't waste your time with this thing by the time we invested in the toy the batteries etc we had quite a few dollars into it for about 15 minutes of fun the toy ca n't just be set down on a table so when my son actually gone bored with it \( to my shock because he loves bubbles \) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over yuck mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash this toy is just a gimmick stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money	5
0	i would have bought this item but the shipping \( 5 53 \) was almost as much as the item itself \( 5 99 \) thanks but no thanks i 'll go to a competitor weird thing is other play doh items are listed with free shipping	5
0	the idea behind this is n't too bad and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time but it has some really ridiculous quirks the shoes are not on any type of timer so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually so what ends up happening of course is dead batteries within a day or so the wand and the tiara both work fine so maybe that set would n't be too bad but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this	5
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy not worth the price would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense	5
0	this toy is terrible ! ! my daughter got this for christmas and it only frustrates her it takes too many cranks to get the clown to pop up and she ca n't get the lid to stay shut without my help the music is terrible i would definitely not recommend this toy	5
0	this is a very cheap toy and mine arrived broken or at least i hope it 's not supposed to sound like it does it sounds nothing like the classic jack in the box that i was hoping for	5
0	i am very unhappy with this product the handle is hard to turn and it takes too long for the clown to pop up when the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy over all i would not recomend it	5
0	it 's a cute little set and i mean little wayyyyy over priced \( \) just did n't live up to expectations	5
0	what a disappointment ! we got this for my daughter because of the enticing tv commercials that make it appear to be fun moldable and not messy however it is none of those and is very messy ! it is just a cross between dust and sand and not fun to play with or to clean up it stays on your hands and a child can easily wipe their eyes and cause problems go with play doh or floam instead	5
0	we tried adding the soap and turned the handlle really fast but it still dosent do much \? \?	5
0	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection i was wrong it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no mountain of bubbles this product does n't work save your money ! !	5
0	not worth the buy very hard to use in the pool vendor delivery service was great	5
0	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition however the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see after we opened the cards \( two sets were purchased \) we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside down the cards are also not particularly sturdy these cards appear to be irregulars	5
0	i bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed it stopped working correctly on one side the remote may be the problem i am not sure we changed the batteries but that did not help i felt bad i bought him a christmas gift that did n't last the day	5
0	my daughter got this for christmas and it only says know what goes good with everything \? ripped pants ! then he sings you wo n't end up like the fool who ripped his pants and then says this is so embarrassing ! my daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we ca n't get it to do it again it seems like it 's stuck in the demo mode and we ca n't figure out how to make it work i called fisher price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time probably due to the fact that every parent who 's child recieved this toy is calling to complain	5
0	we bought this item for my daughter 's christmas present and the strings do not work at all all it does is play the 3 songs and the microphone works but the other functions \( anything to do with the strings \) do not work at all we bought this at toys r us and we 're taking it back tomorrow as i can see from the reviews \( which i wish i 'd read earlier \) we 'll be getting a different brand of guitar these seem faulty as a rule do not buy this	5
0	my daughter is almost three and she was so excited when she received this for christmas unfortunately the strings do not work and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and or chords and they do n't work either i was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this and i was so disappointed when amazon responded there are no replacements available i'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it	5
0	we got this guitar for my 4 year old she loved it but it stopped functioning after less than a month i thought i need to change batteries but even after that it did n't work now i do n't know what to do with it i did n't keep the box so that i could return it very disappointed	5
0	my daughter got this doodle bear for christmas 2006 she wrote all over it and i washed it like the directions say i took it out of the washing machine and the bear was ripped she played with it again and i washed it again in the pillow case the bear came out of the washing machine worse off it seems that the bear rips at the seams do n't waste your money on this bear	5
0	this is probably one of the best booster packs out there every monster that comes in the pack has an effect effect monsters can be very useful not to mention that my very first pharaonic guardian pack came with a secret rare ! that is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack ! even the common cards are great such as giant axe mummy or the gravekeeper cards ! your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack ! i highly suggest this pack	5
0	we bought this for our son for christmas this year based on glowing reviews what a disappointment ! the musical instruments are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same the song the drum plays is tinny scratchy and short and nothing seems very well made i at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another on the plus side it is cute and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound	5
0	you could make your own ! i bought these through a catalog for my 3 year old last christmas he pretends they are leaf blowers if you find the sweet spot the tones are okay but finding that spot is n't easy too much money for not enough product	5
0	it would be really nice if they could put out sets in single ethnicities i do not like my child having multi cult propaganda shoved down her throat via her toys ! she wants to play with dolls that look like her this is only natural too bad cute set and i would have bought it	5
0	this is the cutest furreal i have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it 's mouth why did it come with a bottle \? all ir does is grunt and beg does n't walk and it 's eyes do not close so you ca n't pretend it is asleep i ca n't return it cause it was a valantine 's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig	5
0	ok my kid loves it but after seeing it in person i cant believe how much i was charged for list little plastic toy cost is way over excessive strongly suggest saving your money unless money is no object	5
0	my son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it while i was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets the previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off there 's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help if i had the receipt i would have returned it	5
0	our son has dyslexia we are using this as a tool to build his family of sounds and spelling rules he thinks it is fun and is building on his skills at the same time	5
0	the pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic my daughter 's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse after asking santa for a cinderella castle she was a bit disappointed this playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it	5
0	my sons received this for christmas and it 's already out of commission the quality of the fabric \( more like paper \) is such that the polls very quickly poked through leaving the folding elasticated sticks to stick out it 's a great idea but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks here 's hoping that i can sew up the holes without tearing it more	5
0	this high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies when screwing together the sections i managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy this toy is very basic the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth invest in some power tools and make your own i guarantee it would be better than this one	5
0	the item arrived to us the week of christmas three weeks after we had ordered it it arrived with several broken and several missing parts amazon would not send us new parts they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first this was to be a christmas gift to my son so that was not optional had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would i would have had time to return it	5
0	i tried this toy at it 's lowest volume and it 's still lound enough to damage young eardrums remember that this toy is much closer to their ears than yours	5
0	even though yugioh is dead this is my favorite pack \( even though i don t get them any more \) the deck that i made is an archfiend deck which can kill you if you do n't have a spell card on the field that says you do n't have to pay life points for archfiend cards they are also one of the strongest group if cards there is terrorking archfiend infernalqueen archfiend archfiend solder and others even though yugioh is dead some people still play ot and some stores but them from you i sold my deck for you should too	5
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	5
0	this tor breakes when you build tall buildings but i made a mouse out of them when the magnets are pushed back that makes me angry but you can make people by just putting four magnets on one ball but in all i say you shuld decide yourself	5
0	my kids love magnetix but i am unable to order them online because you do not ship to canada this problem occurs a lot someone should fix that i find it very frustrating when i try to order something and then it tells me they are unable to fullfill my order because we ca n't ship outside the usa	5
0	our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity in fact i would like to know this myself	5
0	the dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea the only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself i wish the case closed more tightly it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily overall tho aside from the annoyance of the lid for the price it was still worth purchasing because as i 've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection	5
0	when i received the doll i turned it on and she made about 4 or 5 facial expressions before she said a word she is not operating properly and since i ordered the doll a month and a half beofre my daughter 's birthday i was unable to return or exchange i was told to contact the manufacture i guess the doll was mishandled before it reached me be careful	5
0	my friends and i \( all over 21 for reference \) sat down to play this one day and we just could not find this game interesting or fun or amusing in the least i'm not sure what is needed to make this fun or challenging but none of us could make it past 15 minutes of play it will not be brought out again	5
0	this is the worst game i have ever played it was so bad that we did n't even finish it came down to just guessing and could have gone on all night without a clear winner this game sucks ! i would n't buy this game with somebody elses money even if it were only 1	5
0	my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday she loves tub toys but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water my daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it quot swim quot on the floor i'm a big fan of sassy toys but i 'd pass on this one	5
0	i bought this vehicle for my son we have been through 2 already they do not work the controller is not made very well the two cars we bought did not respond the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work the other car would only go forward and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought definitely a disappointment	5
0	the controller range is less than 40 feet this car is much too fast for the short range it is very easy to outrun the contoller there is also a delay between control input and vehicle response all batteries were new and fully charged checked with a meter a scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference the older tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time	5
0	i never imagined i was going to be such a bad experience when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side then the game is complicated and it is not balanced so everybody will choose the dark side because they have advantages dont waste you money buying this game better buy the normal risk acquire or axes and allie	5
0	this game is very confusing and hard to play thisn is a piece of junk get the origional risk	5
0	we were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a christmas present for our four year old son the parking garage came with pre drilled holes and needed to be assumbled unfortunately due to poor quality the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional it would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly	5
0	i ordered the ants in december \( christmas present \) and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout january no ants arrived i have called several times with the same excuse they have my money and wo n't deliver the ants i would suggest any other company besides uncle milton industries	5
0	the gates and fences are hard to set up and they fall back down easily best for modeling not play	5
0	the nose is glued and sewn on but my baby still managed to chew it off i found it hanging by a thread from it 's face one day so cut off the nose before giving it to your baby or never leave your baby alone with it once teething starts too bad about the nose because my baby loves his puppytunes	5
0	i think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones	5
0	my friend got this toy for me saying it was the best and because i'm a dancer when i opened it the doll 's head fell off and when i dropped it it broke i suggest instead going to a real studio because this was a waste of my friends money	5
0	all thomas the train products are overpriced there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price choose one of those ! save yourself some money	5
0	we baught a bunch of these fish for our 8 year old we have a inground pool and thought they would be lots of fun ! ! okay we took them out of the package and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water ! ! ! when we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side in circles nothing was realistic about these things ! ! ! ! i should add that it was not just this one but all of them ! ! ! do not waste your money or time buying these ! !	5
0	i purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with the screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after but if in direct sunlight you ca n't see it either it 's pretty small \( buttons and screen \) and a little confusing if you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this then do n't but if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent go for it	5
0	my mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan and for x mas i thought i 'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have man do i regret it she never plays it anymore the puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks the keys on the keypad are hard to push in and if you do n't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game play is blah really if you bought this for someone it 's the kind of present that they 'd be happy with for all of a few hours then they 'd let it collect dust like my mum is	5
0	my daughter was thrilled to see a new wheel of fortune game out and we bought it immediately ! it 's quite abit smaller than the original ca n't imagine why they would do that and it already has problems with the bonus round ! we may just have a bad one but my daughter has gone back to using the 20 year old one she has even with the faded screen and weak sound	5
0	i misunderstood the dimensions listed \( 7 5 x 1 5 x 10 5 inches \) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle it is n't apparently the dimensions include the packaging she loves wheel of fortune on tv and i thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands very disappointing i 'll be returning it unopened	5
0	radica used to amke good hand held electronic games this was is cheap buttons need to be pressed unusually hard to respond dark screen that lights up only when the room is nearly pitch black	5
0	we were so excited to order this item sadly the quality is very poor we have had it set up for less than a week and the front counter has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off my kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes even with general play it sways back and forth a little scary if little ones are playing in it i am going to call the maker hopefully we can repair this \(	5
0	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater but a house cave secret hideout restaurant and schoolhouse very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws etc it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it the front panel that the child rest 's his her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater other than the durability factor great product	5
0	my daughter got this for her 5th birthday and it really looks cute and fun in the box within 5 minutes of playing with it the small clip that holds the starfish open broke in addition the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic if your kids are like mine they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it this toy is really cute but not worth it save yourself the hassle buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in	5
0	if you want your child to know the true bibical account of jesus' birth the shepherds came first ! an angel announced his birth the shepherds hurried to see mary joseph baby jesus they were first on the scene some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later i will return my three sets order the one with the bells whistles and two shepherds ! !	5
0	this is not quite what i was expecting i thought the mat was at least electronic or something to provide feedback however it 's just a plain cheap filmsy plastic mat that really adds nothing to the whole cheerleading experience also the video really moves too fast for my 4 yr old daughter and just up frustrating her it might work okay for older kids but it 's not very good for the younger ones	5
0	product is average on ours the button whole is sewed so tight even i have problems buttoning impossible for my 20 month old it says clothes remove fully and easily which i thought would be great for my daughter since she likes to try and dress things but the pullover has to be removed by pulling over the head and it is n't easy and again is almost impossible for a little one also ours did n't come with a back pack which i'm sure would have made the toy more fun ! perhaps she 'll gain interest and capability with the toy in months to come but right now she has about as much interest in it as she does in say carpet	5
0	i was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up it took me about 2 1 2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up the joining brackets could n't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart i went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it this is why i am returning it if it 's not safe for me to be in then i certainly do n't want my daughter playing in it	5
0	we bought three of these over the last few months since they keep breaking the last one lasted a single afternoon and the kids were upset when it broke yet again its not made very well dont waste your mone	5
0	my 3 yr old son received this toy last year for christmas and was so excited in less than a week one of the rear wheels cracked in half rendering it a non returnable piece of junk	5
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for the snow was much grainer than i had expected i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that instant snow was very fine and really looked like snow this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture	5
0	if you want a beautiful asian doll i just found a couple in ebay under asian berenguer girl doll the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and won't leave home without it	5
0	got this for xmas present for 2 year old he loved it but sounds and steam quickly stopped working with zero abuse incredibly cheap for a toy costing 40 bucks this is just how to ruin a fan of the show the folks who design such badly designed stuff should be ashamed of themselves my son is important and deserves toys that can last more than two days	5
0	the start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down the battery is tedious to re charge \( required after every use ! \) dangerous when child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over for all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression or a frustrated child who ca n't operate start button alone you could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it total supervision required any way you look at it a real expensive gimicky toy !	5
0	this one does n't work it is supposed to come on when it hits the water and it does n't one it came on randomly but we could n't seem to replicate it none of this type of fish seem to do all that well but this one is worse than the others he is pretty though	5
0	it never worked period not even for a second get the disney fish it does n't look as real but at least it works	5
0	my five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll she was so happy when she opened her present and found mermaidia elina doll she took it out of the box and started to play with it soon enough she lost interest however the wings are large so large they are actually a burden placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either all in all this doll is just make up if you see what i mean pretty but not easy to play with and easily forgotten she is on a stand in my daiughter 's room and has n't been touched or played with since christmas morning not worth the price	5
0	i purchased this product along with the koi and turtle and they worked for one day the koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out the turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool	5
0	i bought this for my 5 year old and as another reviewer said he would have to be double his size for it to fit \( he wears a size 5 6 \) and the items attached to it keep falling off we had to duct tape it together to fit him because of course i would rather have returned it but it was his favorite present ! ! ! it frustrates him a lot so i do not see him sticking with it !	5
0	first of all the quality is horrendous second of all the rules are so nonsensical and complicated i had to change the rules just to make this game playable and enjoyable you think that they would make a better game for loyal friends fans i guess not at least the questions are good they are not all extremely easy which makes it fun to pla	5
0	all non yellow parts of the ducks are painted and come off pretty easily a little moisture and some teeth for a minute can remove paint this toy is best for those who are past placing toys or anything in their mouth i still think they are cute and a great idea just need to be made better safer	5
0	the wooden thomas the tank engine trains do not fit in this case the case is way to small for the trains to fit in i would not recommend anyone buying this item it is just a brightly painted metal box that doesnt serve any useful purpose the manufactor should be ashamed for false advertising	5
0	my son received this as a gift i love that the inside is set up like shelves my son loves to organize his trains in it i do n't like how thin the metal is it dents as easy as a cola can if it were made better it would be worth the money save your money on this one and find something better made	5
0	well now this carry case is a goner the latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent it was fun while it lasted	5
0	this game has zero replay value once you play the three episodes you 're done each run through of each episode is the same played through the entire disc in an hour and half my advice spend a few dollars more and get scene it !	5
0	my two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later however there are two problems one it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and two it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame but of course my daughter never noticed either of those she simply loves to play with it constantly and has to take it on walks around the block	5
0	the features on this toy are cute just not planned out very well my boys love the music and bubbles but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days the voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord for a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more overall in our house this is a bubble machine	5
0	i though this shark would be bigger i bought the same one at a gift shop in ri for 99 cents 2 years ago	5
0	this item is nothing like picture poorly made i could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases not worth the money avoid this item	5
0	it lauches the marble so forcefully that the marble bounces off of the ramp it is being lauched to instead of using it for the fridgits set my youngest son used it to launch m m 's \( but that 's another story \)	5
0	if rating a quot no star quot was possible that 's what it really deserves i bought this for my two year old twin boys and as i was inflating it with a handpump it blew at the seams ! beyond patching ! unfortunately they never even knew that they had it i would not buy it again because of the quality of the product how can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump \? \? \? that 's like blowing it up by mouth !	5
0	had 3 leaks all in the seams ! could not patch correctly even after waiting the quot 30 mins quot to re infalte like the directions stated my son was extremely upset from other reviews it sounds like there is a 50 50 chance of getting a good product	5
0	we bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas we turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out we thought it was just a case of dead batteries so we replaced the batteries several times until we realized the product was just bad when trying to get it replaced we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead needless to say our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere ever we 'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music	5
0	i was looking for a durable tape player for the kids and this was not it the microphone only worked for a couple of weeks it plays tapes ok but would have liked to play with the other features before they stopped functioning my kids are rough on toys but not that rough	5
0	christmas morning my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited what a disapointment nothing i did caused the tail to wag the leg to move and no licking action i changed the batteries still nothing after hours of trying to get it to work i went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar very hard finally the tail wagged the foot moved and then it actually licked what a piece of work very cute but way too much work in time i will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar save your money	5
0	i support the comments that others make this game is so poorly designed it is laughable i cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once forget trying to follow the directions they left out many important rules the board does n't work especially the way the pieces fit into it and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner what is up with that \? forget this game	5
0	well this game is fun but i ca n't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space ! well its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card but still the game is really fun delane	5
0	my 5 yr old son got this for christmas and played with it only while we where watching \( so we know he did n't do anything to break it \) the day after christmas morning it stopped working we changed the batteries that came with it and still it made noise but no longer would the shovel go up and down nor would it go in reverse i bought this from toys r us in our hometown i threw the box away on christmas day so i ca n't take it back i will try calling the company	5
0	i'm sure this would be a fun toy but for us it did n't last long enough to find out we had this in our pool for 5 minutes and one of the guns stopped working the boys were very disappointed ! i will be taking this back to the store tonight and try to exchange it with a new one that hopefully works	5
0	painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative the only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break	5
0	want a sure fire way to kill your party \? \? put this dvd in turn the music off make people sit down and play this game it was not fast it was not frightening it was not fun your guests would have more fun watching the paint dry in your basement	5
0	this is a very cute set however it 's not very well made and the holders are free standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem with kids the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over disappointing	5
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	5
0	we bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed because it is tall and narrow once a few blocks are in it it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already this was a frustrating not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son	5
0	this seemed to be well put together and would do the job fine except it was not stated anyware that i saw as to the weight the zip line was for rated at only 100 pounds was not enough of a weight limit for this child this information should be published in the advertisment	5
0	the first time i flew the chicken it flopped 2 feet in front of me the second time it went about 6 feet the third time it decapitated ! i was left with a piece of stuffed chicken in each hand unless you are accomplished at disassembling and reassembling stuffed animals it is not repairable save your money for something else	5
0	my daughter loves the van but can rarely use it all alone ! the doors pop off the babies fall out of their seats the stroller gets stuck on the roof rack \( an elastic band \) and the seat belts are just annoying ! i ca n't even buckle them all up ! needless to say she still wants to play with it	5
0	we like the lunchbox because of the cute designs but were a little disappointed in it 's durability the first time i dropped it on the ground it scratched off parts of the design so mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with self laminating sheets that did the trick we also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated other than that it 's o k	5
0	my son is a thomas fanatic this lunchbox did n't last one week without one of the legs snapping off so it would n't stand up then a few weeks later he dropped it and the handle shattered total waste of money it 's a shame it has a nice storage box in front but the quality is below even what i 'd expect from a chinese sweatshop	5
0	the box was a huge hit with my 4 year old and he loved the extra hidden compartment for his treat on the front ours however got a crack in it within the first few weeks it must have dropped just right on a corner it 's still usable but we 'll probably be switching before christmas break	5
0	i would not suggest the purchase of this product as you will only get a few laughs before it starts falling apart to a useless stage if you have the money and you want to buy it go ahead maybe it 's a great product and i just got a defective one but still not a good show of product to me on their part	5
0	is n't barbie supposed to be pretty \? she looks like an ugly prostitute hands down i would n't wear that to a club and neither would any of my friends her make up is gross and especially the look on her face says do me now there 's a difference between beauty and over the top trashy you ca n't deny that she looks like a porn star which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in but i guess we 're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now	5
0	ever wonder what drives someone 's daughter to go into porn \? this has got to be some of the most irresponsible marketing ever please do yourself a favor and make sure toy companys get the message to stop peddling this type of garbage	5
0	ok i do n't have this doll i wo n't buy this doll if i ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this i saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10 13 and i almost fell out of my chair ! this doll is in appropriate for someone under 21 ! the short skirts the short tops how the heck can mattel think that this was a good idea \? i'm 23 years old and i would never dress like that nor would i allow my child to dress like that bottom line shame on you mattel ! !	5
0	like many others the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well who can we contact for help \? there is no information on the box	5
0	a waste of my hard to come by money i am on a fixed income and bought this item for my 10 month old grandson for christmas really a disappointment good idea but he ca n't even hear the animal sounds because they are so low if i could have taken it away from him i definitely would have returned it for a refund ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5
0	big disappointment cheaply made t rex model does not snap together can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded microscope less functional than a magnifying lens volcano is ok the plaster does work but you must provide ingredients for the eruption weather center very very flimsy and breaks i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product supplies for crystals subpar for what is required was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons	5
0	i have to agree with the first two comments we went to check it out after my 4 year old saw it on tv and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him the product seemed decent in the store so we bought it he has only played with it once or twice since christmas the only time he had fun with it was when i got mad and yelled at the thing because it would n't do what it is supposed to save your money and don't buy this junk	5
0	i bought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas she played the sound game she always got the answer correct but 60 70 of the time the bear still said it was incorrect the rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing therefore this is not a learning toy and it is no fun after trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was she decided she hated the thing and did n't ever want to play with it again i took the thing back to the store and got a refund	5
0	this is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old not 8 11 as it states talk about a waste of money i returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the christmas tree this year it was a shame the description was n't more accurate because i was not refunded my expedited shipping costs i paid for this toy thumbs dow	5
0	this product arrived broken and all the pieces are smashed the saddest part is it was a birthday gift for a child who really wanted to play now learning i purchased this from toys r us via amazon have found i cannot return it to amazon it has to go thru the manufacturer to rate this product is very hard because it is in pieces	5
0	i bought this for my 7 year old son it did not take long before the a and b buttons became stuck in the down position the games were not that challenging for a 7 year old but he thought it was great when the a and b buttons fouled up he said it made it more of a challenge dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap	5
0	i purchased this for my sons birthday this year he is three he was so excited to have the play tent but when i took it out of the box and started to put it together i noticed the stitching was not straight and missing in some places it took him no more than 24 hours to brake it the plastic supports and cheap fabric were horrible there was also a center support pole with no place to put it he likes it but the quality craftmanship was a zero	5
0	jack does n't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it do n't waste your money	5
0	worst product ever i really trust crayola but am having doubts after these new outdoor products theyre just terrible made shotty they dont work i am very disappointed this spins so fast that none of the paint comes out then it just pours out in a big wet mess just awful	5
0	we bought this for my daughter for her birthday like the previous reviewer we also did n't realize we needed to dilute the paint first even with the paint diluted properly it does n't really work as expected you have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down i plan on returning this toy for a refund as well	5
0	i bought this product for my children because it looked neat ! what they do n't tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it \( why not include the pre diluted paint \? but i digress \) even after thinning the paint the product hardly spins if we could get it to work it seemed like a neat concept but it just does n't work i have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what we returned ours for a refund	5
0	i purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter who loves barbie it is a simple game but maybe a little too simple she got bored with it really fast she played it once and never again the board was very flimsy and not made well	5
0	our boys had a good time with this toy but after a 5 6 launches it broke ! not just the wings but the plastic body i feel like it was a waste of money and over priced	5
0	i am very disappointed with this product the volume is not adjustable and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room even with a door closed electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand this is the case here so needing to have something repeated loudly can get on your nerves i will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume buyers beware !	5
0	i bought this toy along with mr incredible for my son 's birthday he loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys unfortanitly they lasted all of five minutes before syndromes head fell off and mr incredibles hand broke off after that i had to deal with a crying kid if you want the toy just to look at then it is good but if you buy it for your child do n't expect it to last long	5
0	to start with the description of this kit is false there are not 75 pieces only 11 the detail is very very poor large soft edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the death star as seen in the films you 'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball making a death star from scratch rather than buying this kit	5
0	this product is a box o' junk my son got this for christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it the hat fell apart within three days \( and he hardly played with it just wore it on his head a few times \) the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat which is obviously dangerous i contacted the company and they have not responded	5
0	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months after the one on christmas morning did not function at all the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days the graphics are straight from 1981 and the dancing princesses even make roboty bendy noises as they move very strange and disappointing	5
0	does n't do much for the price basically your daughter watches the ballet dancers on the tv screen tries to follow along it 's not even step by step frankly it 's somewhat difficult to follow wish i had spent my on something else	5
0	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch the only thing they did well with this product is market it i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it	5
0	i have to agree with the other on here i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead i tried and did n't think it was all that fun either i threw the box away and i'm sure i need that to return it if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use	5
0	again the graphics are horrible the mat is boring and not colorful my 3 1 2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b c they are so faded she used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since complete waste of money	5
0	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store or they ran out of color at the factory my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one not like the box or commercial !	5
0	santa gave this to our daughter this year i am thoroughly disappointed with it we put the batteries in and started it up after reading the how to part the graphics are terrible i had to prompt her to which flower to step on not that that was necessary the princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower it just made a funny sound the dancers go fast and fuzzy you ca n't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps i even went on the mat and tried my daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done i hope santa will take this back	5
0	my daughter just received this as a christmas gift she was so excited my husband and mother in law went to the tv to install it 15 minutes later my five year old is in tears i wish this had been reviewed before we purchased the graphics are terrible this will be going back to the store glad i still have the receipt	5
0	wish i could give this a negative when i did finally get a sticker out it would n't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced	5
0	i recently purchased this computer for my twin granddaughters who are four i have returned them because the screen is too small additionally i thought it would have a word processor it does not it is game oriented	5
0	this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close there 's a much better model of an x wing out there do a web search for a company called fine molds it 's a japanese company that makes a finely detailed 1 72 scale x wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle including standing seated pilot figures different droid types it 's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for	5
0	we had it for two weeks then it broke the screen flashes on and off for no reason nothing happened to it it just started doing that very weird no online support available from fisher price for this system either i bought several games that cannot be played now the kids liked it while it lasted though we also have a leapster which has lasted us eight months so far my boys like it much better too ! ! so if you 're going to buy a learning system i would recommend the leapster	5
0	i had two problems with this item first the planter is very small \( only about 6 inches in length \) secondly it never grew ! i bought it for a first grade science experiment but the class was very disappointed because nothing happened this item was not worth the money spent	5
0	when my grandson first received the game he loved it ! then he and his family had to re locate which meant taking down the game when they got to their new home the game does n't stay up like it did	5
0	these trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them they each have been through two sets with the same result the water leaks out after you 've had them awhile they are not worth the money i highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars this was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a thomas product	5
0	as others have stated the dvd mini games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls i also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for other then they may come into play if you win the main game they should have just done a choose your own adventure type game it would have been less high tech but you could at least have a laugh when you choose set up a perimeter and the terrorists once again escape do not buy	5
0	wow i have never seen anything like this it 's worse than bad it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective at the very least amazon should refuse to carry it	5
0	this was a waste of money ! ! i bought these for my daughter sophie who is 23 months old as a valentines day gift the crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger the crayons all kept falling out of their holders and my daughter did n't enjoy playing with them i was not impressed and do not recommend these to anyone	5
0	santa brought this item we opened it several days later and it broke the same day	5
0	we purchased all of the figures for my daughter for christmas within 2 weeks of her receiving this one the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off we replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month the head does not stay on invisible violet syndrome broke in half violet 's pin fell out of her arm and mr incredible lost the pin in his leg my daughter does not play rough with her toys just normal play and they fell apart also helen is supposed to be elasta girl why did n't they make her stretch \? did n't make sense to me	5
0	this toy was so frustrating the pieces would n't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up this was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly in the end it looked like a pile of cloudy lime jello with plastic bones sticking out of it i would not reccomend this toy	5
0	i do n't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy i agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4 year old daughter ! also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time all that being said she loves it	5
0	ok as far as novelty goes these ducks are soooo funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky ! ! ! i bought them for my 1 year old just because i am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky anyone who feels this lil duck toy is devil worship to has some serious issues and i would suggest they need to seek some professional help so for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because i think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight	5
0	ok this isnt really a review but more of a reaction to another review which in my opinion was written by no child it 's just a doll get over it and stop wasting the space where some of us people actually write real reviews i just had to say something about that oh i did order this doll but i'm still waiting for her to arrive	5
0	this item is really small i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item in hindsight i would n't have order it had i paid more attention i think the other products from haba \( eggs and teabags \) are worth the money for the size	5
0	this is very small it 's too small for a play kitchen and you only get one not two like is pictured	5
0	i received my order today and discovered \( as with all of the hasa products in my order \) that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small 2 1 2 x 1 that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	5
0	this game is not for die hard fans of friends the game bored me in 5 minutes you need to watch like three episodes to get most of the questions correct and a lot of it are common sense i was not at all challenged and did not enjoy playing this game and want to sell it back after playing it for 30 minutes do n't buy it	5
0	the main issue is the controls we are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types it tends to just nose dive regardless we will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash that it 's still in one piece is amazing	5
0	they show a pony in the picture but you wo n't get it just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony if you mistakly bought it just keep it you will only get partial refund which is half the buying price	5
0	the horse does n't stay hooked on to the carriage too well it always comes apart it 's a pain it 's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing it 's cute to look at but my daughter lost interest in it quickly	5
0	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review i am extremely disappointed the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola	5
0	this is junk cheap plastic no instructions arrived with some pieces broken \( not in shipping \) much better products available for the cost from the description i expected a much better product this is not it a bargain at 1 3 the price maybe	5
0	back in the day \( 1970 's \) these were made with a stiff strong plastic rigid insert w the poly rope outside this gave the leash a realistic tight but curved under own weight appearance a believable realistic bounce to the dog with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the dog walker however this piece of crap has a thick soft wire inside the leash and this gives the leash a very phony fake looking too heavy all bent up look piece of junk piece of junk piece of junk !	5
0	the idea behind this toy was a cute one but it stops there within five minutes of playing with this toy it broke the dog halter broke off the wire leash and could not be repaired the whole thing ended up in the trash on christmas day !	5
0	i love legos however i too was not real impressed with the 50th anniversary tub the lego com websites description of the contents each bucket includes lego system bricks in your favorite lego colors plus a handful of gold colored bricks ! let 's be real we 're talking a child 's handful not adult my daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket another child i know got 4 his brother 5 the duplo set i bought had 6 if you 're buying for the gold bricks it 's not worth the money	5
0	there are many significant shortcomings in this interactive dvd game i do not recommend it at all it is not at all like the real feud the most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order since it reveals them in order or you lose no steals no strikes sadly i ca n't return it since its a dvd game	5
0	this game fell apart after we got out of the box i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart be careful i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys	5
0	long story short bought for daughter for christmas it is in the trash this was the worst toy doll purchase ever	5
0	i was very excited to give this to my 8 year old pokemon addict the toy is very cheap comes in attached plastic and needs to be assembled when assembled the wing breaks off constantly and the tail does n't stay together junk !	5
0	my son received this figure for his birthday it broke within the first 5 minutes the sign on his chest lights up which is cool but now he has no legs so he certainly ca n't run	5
0	this toy seemed like a fun idea however it is utter chaos the toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off i think it may be slightly posessed !	5
0	i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer 's description one picture seems to have been deleted now the manufacturer 's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash i trusted that the manufacturer 's description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all it is very simple with vinyl wings be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect	5
0	my friends and i spend hours selling lemonade using this stand ! !	5
0	it has know fun no education and is a wayst of time	5
0	i bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother who is impossible to please she needed a new card shuffler as she was n't pleased with her plastic battery operated one i must admit i thoroughly expected to have to return it since i knew she would n't be pleased with it as it turns out i did have to return it but here 's the surprise i was very disappointed in its performance too ! we could not get it to shuffle cards whether they be from a new deck or an old worn out dog eared deck moral of this story please do n't buy this item whether you 're difficult to please or not	5
0	this item looks great in theory but it just is n't worth it the pegs are made in all different sizes some fall out some do n't fit in and some stick out too far leaving you with a messy look to your lite art one of the crayons for the neon was broken when received but it did n't matter since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway if you do buy this item be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that is n't even included	5
0	the kids got it for christmas and it looked like fun however the one we got does n't work at all i'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common but i ca n't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries and then i ca n't get it to go into the game mode plus the rules of the electronic version are different in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words i prefer the rules of the old version better i'm planning to return this and get the old version	5
0	falls over constantly fustrating for everyone only good thing is the sleeping bag that comes with it	5
0	this is not the usual quality that playhut stands for the tent is held up by one plastic corded pole that wo n't keep the tent upright my daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses the slumber bag is pretty but the tent tunnel is useless	5
0	we were excited for the first bunch of stickers and then my 5 year old wanted to try it himself it jammed up and that was the end of it there are no instructions on how to fix it so i threw the cartridge away do n't waste your money	5
0	my son and i have had the same experience with this sticker maker great fun for the first 5 10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and i did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before i was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together too bad he loved it while it lasted	5
0	this is not a very fun toy my got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly he also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars he went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy there was n't enough paint to even create a picture the happy birthday pic on the back of the package must 've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist i think crayola should stick to making crayons	5
0	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5
0	paint doesnt load or expel easily waste of money and time my daughter is happier with a bucket of plain water and a brus	5
0	i was very excited about this game until it came out of the box it looks great for my 3 year old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game this should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect it is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value i think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled	5
0	to anyone who buys this toy keep the box and receipt handy we may be the odd one out but we purchased this toy and it did n't work the legs on manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball this did n't happen rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire' and if we were lucky one would shoot out after great effort it comes with three foam balls two of which fit the third was slightly too big and would jam ours is going back to the store today	5
0	do not like this product at all the girls on the video are not facing the right way for easy instruction we have to go the opposite way very uncool my daughter started crying too i told her it was n't her fault you want your child to feel good about themselves and all it does is make them feel like they are n't good enough do not waste your money	5
0	we purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much i expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed the mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head	5
0	this toy like several other mattel toys i 've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together troublesome to play with and not durable i wish mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers toys can be easy to assemble intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank it just depends on priorities of the toy design builder	5
0	my son received this for christmas 2005 and played with it every day the conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost after a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working it still made plenty of noise but did n't move anymore ! when i called mattel they could n't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001 ! although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy it was n't for as much as i paid for the toy	5
0	this one is rather small and does n't really look or feel like the rest not as durable feeling as the others	5
0	we bought this game yesterday for our daughter the dolls are very difficult for her to dress we have to do it for her also two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times she loves the game and the princesses and it does teach memory but it could be made much better	5
0	what a co incidence my first 3d puzzle too average difficulty for the average user would not recommend it for the beginner the panels are not hard to put together but it is fiddly putting all the panels together once done the model is quite magnifique and got me started on 3d puzzles hasbro wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3d puzzle then everyone would get hooked on it none of the 3d puzzles can stand a lot of handling however this eiffel tower actually survived a show and tell sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and i'm too lazy to put it back together again highly recommended	5
0	bought this in clearance at toys r us it sounds like junk and poorly made i plan to return the 2 bought for my twins i was forced to put one star but would have also left zero if i could spend a little more you get what you pay for this would be best left at the curb than taking up room in my girls bedrooms sad sad sad i hate retruning things it is a waste of my time	5
0	i popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever i even put in a different set up batteries still no dice this is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever i am sorry that i will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill after the reading the other reviews perhaps i am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound i gather that i'm not missing much	5
0	i bought this for my son 's birthday last night since he is interested in music as i was wrapping it i noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position i took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place wondering how many times i was going to have to do this i decided to test it once i fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys \( you can even see through them \) the dollar store has better toys than this the sound is horrible and uncontrollable the controls are worthless i'm returning it today and good riddance	5
0	this playhut was very frustrating for our children my children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position our trouble began when we turned it into a tent the sleeping bag is one side of the tent it 's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play after about ten minutes the playhut was turned over and on the ground we returned it	5
0	this toy is not what i had expected it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it	5
0	i bought this toy for my three yr old she was excited but then one of the dolls fell apart its pelvis broke and the legs fell out super glue might fix it but i'm not sure i 'd recommend it for an older child who would n't play with it so roughly but for the price i wanted it to last more than three days	5
0	i have to agree with everyone before me flimsy hard to put together does n't stay together impossible to close my four old who is obsessed with batman lost interest after 5 minutes and i really ca n't blame him spend your 50 on something else ! ! ! not a good purchase ! ! ! ! !	5
0	this pack is really bad ! i love attacktix but this pack is terible ! the only good figues are luke skywalker and megatron darth vader 's arm broke super optimus prime 's blast shoots before you press the button and the battle masters are pathetic the battle master 's point value is 70 each but they are very easy to kill and their blasts are very bad do yourself a faver skip this and buy the star wars attacktix series 4 starter set	5
0	this thing only lasted 3 days ! i mean really i charged it up and it worked fine but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off ! on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again ! ! ! ! ! ! so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud do never buy this toy ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5
0	my 7 year old son got it for christmas he was really excited it is definitely a neat toy the whole family was into it however it only lasted one day it would no longer charge and i am just going to take it back because i am in no position waste 20 00 just for one day	5
0	what a disappointment ! the music quality is very poor most of the intruments sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy the piano is probably the worst the animal voices all sound the same i thought i 'd get better quality at the price plus the left speaker does n't work my kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost 12 00 and was the size of an egg carton and its sound was vastly superior i will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this	5
0	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to	5
0	concept was good but fails because its not constructed well after 2 months the toy 's electronics went out	5
0	i got this to for my daughter for her birthday i opened it and put the bubble solution and batteries into it and it worked fine later that night the bubble blower was n't blowing anymore so the next morning i changed out the batteries and still it was n't working i returned it the next day it was really cute and i wanted it to work but it just would n't start and it also kept leaking every where i put it the sticky soap mess was there after i picked it up this was not a good toy	5
0	put simply this toy does n't work or i should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it it sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore did n't mind when we took it back	5
0	i got this as a gift for my 18 month old son it only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle very sad my son got very frustrated and so did i i would not recommend this product	5
0	i just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t v sets no luck i ca n't even give it 1 star because i do n't know how fun it is \( or might be \) i tried every input available on every t v i tried changing the batteries i tried hooking it directly to the t v as well as thru the vcr and dvd player nothing worked i guess i know why it only cost 5 99	5
0	i purchased this car for my 2 year old son for christmas shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to christmas morning the car lights up and makes sounds \( very annoying \) but did n't move an inch i replaced all batteries still no movement the manufacturer was of no help thank god someone else also got him the chicco remote control car because it works ! steer clear of this stinker	5
0	we received this as a gift and did n't like it at all my two year old used it for about a day but it does n't go very far with the remote \( you ca n't just have it move across the floor \) and it 's very noisy ! if it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise i 'd go with something else if you 're looking for a first remote control ca	5
0	do n't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct tape if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon the moon also has an automatic time that it comes on it 's supposed to be when it gets dark but it comes on way too early to be any good because nobody is in their room that early and it only stays on for 30 minutes when it comes on by itself \( because its too early \) you can barely notice it is on	5
0	gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday it was supposed to be easy to fly it rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight spewing propeller parts everywhere with all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly if you buy this heli do n't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together	5
0	the tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up the landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect final thought after several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix i managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds if you want an r c helicopter try the japanese made hirobo xrb sr	5
0	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store it was not worth the money it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better i wish i had known that before i spend 10 on this piece of junk	5
0	actually we love the game very much but are very disappointed with pressman toys here 's the scoop our game came with only 20 pegs of each color the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color we 've called the company 1800 800 0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs just bad business practice in my opinion as the saying goes when you love something you tell a few people when you 're not happy you tell everyone i 'll be sure to check that i'm not buying items from pressman toys next time so instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we 'll just have to win in fewer steps sigh !	5
0	this was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas the screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good as soon as your child starts walk his new dog the wheels completely unscrew which can be a terrible choking hazzard we have tried everything to keep them on plus the leash tore off from around poor spot 's neck and no type of glue seems to keep it on i'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash it was good idea and a cute toy but not worth the money you 're better off buying a plastic already put together one	5
0	for the most part this is a good toy it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week \) my daughter \( 4 \) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the mommy daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on \? every 5 10 minutes then it really is good i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great	5
0	very fun i love it is like a dream in a book the wings do fall of but not often what i say is yes get it	5
0	i bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher since barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse the wings fall off we must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day	5
0	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min successful flight on the second day after 15 mins of recharging the battery the battery case and wires melted have contacted company for a refund	5
0	i think this doll is incredibly fun and beautiful but somehow the tail broke off the very first day my 4 year old daughter played with it she loves it anyway she insists she just screamed with pleasure after seeing the hair turn purple and the tattoos appear after about 3 minutes in the freezer i do n't know how it got broken or how rough my daughter might have been but it seems strange that it would break so quickly disappointing	5
0	i ca n't wait until i get the movie barbie fairytopia mermaida when it comes out its going to be a great movie for kids and even for the whole family i do n't know if i will get the dolls i think the movie will be funer to watch than just play with the doll	5
0	besides being unstable this truck is extremely frustrating ! my son is constantly trying to put items in the truck that are too big and then if he does manage to get a load in he ca n't get it back out again ! ! he has cried in frustration and thrown the toy across the room i will be buying him a fisher price one for his birthday that actually dumps	5
0	we got this for our son for easter and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck and the handle part was opened so it was the flat blue portion of the truck well he some how slipped and ended up cutting his forehead b c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part luckily enough it was n't where he needed stitches but still so i called little tikes and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy so there customer service at little tikes is definitly a ! just watch out because i think the ages on this toy should be a little older semper f	5
0	i think this product needs a lot of hands on supervision my son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself twice on the 2nd day of trying this after a couple of weeks he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over and his 6 y o friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself \( almost had to call the paramedics \) knowing what i know now i would not buy this product for kids under 8 \( follow the age recommendations ! ! ! ! ! \) i would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down	5
0	i was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use however the new type of valve does not hold in the air it says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one i bought would not stay in and when i tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated it would have been perfect had the valve worked properly	5
0	we loved this pool for three weeks which is as long as we had it this morning i went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1 4 of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool through plastic i could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours a total waste of money	5
0	this is a great idea for a great marketing group little kids who want to listen to music just like the big kids the fp3 has a few issues of it own but the speakers were disappointing the sound quality is not good even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast to top it all off my son has difficulty getting the fp3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own overall we were very disappointed with this accessory	5
0	far to difficult to pop product did n't match picture but the company was very friendly and co operative in the return process would do business with this company again but would buy one item as a test before buying in bulk or i would just call the company	5
0	it looks fun in the picture but there is a major design flaw with this toy the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle this toy should be recalled do not buy it i would send mine back but we had already thrown out the packaging	5
0	i bought this for my daughters 6th birthday the lips on the doll did n't work and there really is n't much to do with it she was bored almost immediately i was hoping for much more out of this toy in my opinion you should n't waste your money	5
0	the retro slinky dog however cute just does n't work we have tried it on the hardwood floor the carpet the title we have tried tying a string arounds it 's neck adding a string to it 's short stubby string using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works our kids 2 6 just drag it around laying on it 's side it 's just not fun the head is too heavy and it does n't move well at all i would not buy it the fisher price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright it walks with you and the pull string is a good length plus it 's cute too ! !	5
0	if i would have been able to try this out before buying it i would have never bought it the surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it the it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on i would have much rather bought a playmat instead	5
0	my daughter got this came for christmas and it is still fun to play but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow they want a little overboard in their updating of this one new colors would have been fine but all the curves zig zags etc make this version a poor substitute for the older versions i'm going to ebay !	5
0	you can get the old vintage aggravation games on ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand made wooden boards as well these new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones	5
0	hard to follow instructions i ended up throwing it in a drawer after trying to get the hang of it after 5 minutes if you want to buy one i will give you mine \) total waste of money	5
0	the toy is a good idea but it needs to be more user friendly instructions are hard to follow even for adults maybe not quite so much activities at one time could simplify some for younger players	5
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected about 4 inches long i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package it 's a pull back and go car and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels they were wobbly from then on this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell very dissappointed	5
0	bought this and several other minimates for by son 's birthday as we are huge lego fans i thought this would be a great compliment the lego like bricks are ill fitted either constantly coming undone or never being able to fit together at all this caused great frustration and unhappiness we finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the batcave or any of the vehicles together do not buy i would like a full refund and an apology from amazon for carrying such an afwul quaility toy and from the creator of the minimates ugh	5
0	this toy is great fun but it is n't very durable ours broke after about an hour there was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting i guess the plastic bladder must have given out the kids were terribly disappointed	5
0	after waiting 3 4 weeks it finally arrived ! to my grandchildrens dismay it did not perform as advertised there was n't any volcano erupting all it did was sprinkle a small amount from the side yes we did have good water pressure and it was put together correctly ! i just want my money and shipping charges back ! thank you for your expediency on this return	5
0	despite reading bad reviews i took a chance and purchased this item i got the first one hooked it up and it quit working within two hours ordered a second it quits working within the hour i should have known better as others have posted the same experience great concept maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year please do n't waste your time on this one now	5
0	my 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon and so did i initially however during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder the problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy my son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when i saw what had happened personally i would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented otherwise i would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product	5
0	the webkinz yorkie puppy i received is total different from what shown on the picture evne though it is still a dog it is not the one displaied on the picture which my kid really like it is a total waste	5
0	this is a preety good game but after a while it is very boring i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it	5
0	perhaps a age group should be posted as with most toy sellers i bought it for my 4 year old nephew and it 's worthless to anyone other than i guess stores who like to stick star war stickers on the retail counters it is deceiving and the retailer is arrogant and would not even consider a return since it was opened to see what it was avoid this retailer and it 's products	5
0	this was a total change from the boardgame it is a lot of fun however i have changed the winning amount otherwise someone can win the whole game with just one hand	5
0	i am disappointed because this is a really flimsy toy the launch button does n't push most of the time \( so superman does n't launch \) and the foam superman tears easily	5
0	pro easy to visualize the numbers on the screen cons the biggest negative draw back is that the keys are not very sensitive you have to push very hard and often multiple times to get a response this is very frustrating the help keys does not help at all do not buy it it is a wasting money	5
0	my 3 year old daughter and i have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand the design is nice it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice however after using it twice the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted this makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place it makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving my daughter was frustrated i eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child i do n't recommend this wand	5
0	the dress featured on this particular set shows a girl in a flowing blue and pink gown you get the blue and pink gown but it 's not what 's pictured on the box it sort of looks like it but it is a flimsier straight version of the one pictured also my daughter just turned 4 she 's on the petite side and is around 32 lbs this dress just fits her hope this info helps	5
0	the canopy bar broke only two days after christmas now i have a sharp end on the bed frame not goodfor little fingers for the price i thought it wouldhave been a lot more sturdy	5
0	bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6 within the first week one of the sticks was broken called the company and they sent out another one but before it could arrive the other stick broke they are n't made strong enough to use they plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart we ended up throwing it out	5
0	this is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play my sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken the company was nice enough to send a new one out but now \( only a few weeks later \) the plastic on the goal is shattered the goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored overall i would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play ! !	5
0	out of the box we noticed the table top was warped when you push on one side of it the other pops up definately not suitable for crafts or play returned it that night	5
0	this is the 3rd and by far the most disappointing of all the sound does n't work yes i put the batteries in correctly and yes i turned it on the van car kept getting stuck my son was very disappointed and can only play pretend with it i did n't pay all that money for an interactive toy and it does n't work very disappointed in all these sets and will not buy another	5
0	i was disappointed with the quality of this item little tike is a name i have learned to trust and this was a bummer the front broke because of it 's poor design and flimsy plastic parts so now it is just a broken dump truck also you have to push the button for the sounds to work it is not motion sensitive	5
0	i picked this up on clearance but i still think i spent too much the older versions were made of much sturdier material the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game the questions are okay but many are very obscure trivial pursuit is a great game and it 's one of my favorites but this version is a dud save your money if you have the older version it 's still a lot more fun to play	5
0	the stars may be really nice but the package i received looked already open the 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars	5
0	this was given to my 2 year old as a present it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with the concept is good all the animals and farmer are built very well but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together	5
0	our son received this toy for his first birthday it has a lot of good features teaches colors numbers farm animals and their sounds several songs but the music is awful the singer is off key on every single song \( either that or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice \) as someone who appreciates music i cannot tolerate listening to this especially since there are far better toys out there since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy \( the learning table which has much better quality music and the fridge farm \) we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy	5
0	the beads and charms are nice enough but for the price you get very little with this kit only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers plus the charms there 's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies	5
0	it 's a very cute lamp but it 's very noisy ! i had read the reviews and other people had said it 's noisy but i did n't think it would sound like something ready for liftoff ! !	5
0	as you can see by other posts we were all duped by a misleading advertisement it still shows realistic tail movement in the listing hello ! ! ! what tail \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! \? they have since changed the picture to the doll we all received the original picture showed the swimming one \( tail attached \) my daughter was absolutely heartbroken when she opened this and realized this doll has no tail nor does she swim i fully expect to be allowed to return this thing \( opened \) at no cost to myself	5
0	i only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid i compared amazon 's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered we did not get what we ordered we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume not the swimming one ! this was from santa and i'm sorry but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old 's eyes just breaks your heart of course it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands for the first time in my years of shopping i feel robbed	5
0	i did not purchase this doll from amazon though my daughter received it as a gift the real swimming mermaid do not buy this doll ! ! ! she took a bath last night with it and it did not swim ! it did not even move a bit except for sinking to the bottom of the tub my daughter was ultimately disappointed and now we are going to try to take it back and get the disney swimming mermaid doll buyer beware this doll is not what you think	5
0	i ordered the doll because it said it will swim when put in water when i recieved the doll it was just a barbie it is not the swimming mermaid	5
0	i had water rockets like this when i was a kid in the early 1970s the rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package they shoot high and straight and are loads of fun my only gripe is with the pump when i was a kid the pump was heavy plastic and metal the pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic the knob on the end broke off the first or second day my son and i are still able to shoot the rockets but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket	5
0	its disgusting that any company would make this figure into a toy complete with knives \? geez give the kid a manuel next time	5
0	i bought these from a local dollar store i thought wow all these for one dollar \? big mistake i love painting and am good at it but this set ruins every paper canvas painting at all the brush hairs fall out and get mixed with the paint do not buy this product	5
0	while the kids love it it 's a headache for parents it takes forever to inflate even with an air compressor thanks to many individual air chambers as other reviewers noted it 's best not to leave it outside \( the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage \) but it 's far too big to leave up inside the house not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down i gave ours away	5
0	this thing is a waste of time effort and money it falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with	5
0	dissapointed with this product ! our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart ! small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys	5
0	swing comes out of base every time you try to put the baby doll in it and i bought the exact baby for it the educational value of 3 stars is for me you get what you pay for most of the time	5
0	when i bought this toy i thought it was soooo cool but it really does n't do anything it 's supposed to do ! it just makes annoying crying and whining noises that do not sound real even if i tickle its tummy it just whines and cries do not i repeat do not buy this toy ! ! ! !	5
0	the idea behind this toy is great ours has lived up to its durability claim my husband did not complain about adding songs to it so it could not have been too bad batteries this eats through them like crazy and we used duracell volume the idea of volume control is good but the highest volume is way too low i ca n't even hear anything until i get it to the mid setting my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones we probably should not have bought this until next year maybe fisher price will have improved it by then	5
0	first of all i think the concept is great however the safety bobber does n't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart if you 're looking for something that shoots buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money shame on you roland martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage do n't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item	5
0	do not waste your money on this toy the battery is not available for this toy learn from my mistake don't waste your money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9 6 volt battery is not included all it says is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote do n't look for the tyco 9 6 volt battery in a store or on line because it will be out of stock i have been trying to purchase one for 4 months	5
0	bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts but the surprise here is the complicity of amazon in this misleading packaging this is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found they know they made a mistake if only they would contact us each now for a full refund i wish a rep from amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger i wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for his big gift	5
0	luckily i had one of the 9 6 volt batteries around and saved myself 20 dollars after placing the battery in which is no easy task he has to walk behind it to get it to go the range is terrible why is there no antenna on the vehicle also \? too bad i threw the box away xmas morning now i'm out 49 99 live and lear	5
0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	5
0	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead im 11 yrs ol	5
0	this toy is a ripoff for 1 2 yr olds and you 'll get annoyed couase the games are sooooooooooo hard even for me a 12 year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies 4evr 4evr and evr forever do you hear me ! ! ! ! ! go to you wont regret it ! ! or you can laugh at me i dont car	5
0	i nearly bought this until i read that it involves cardboard and stickers that 's shameful search amazon 's partners and other major booksellers for the nostalgia edition of stratego it runs 4 or 5 more it has plastic pieces with metallic paint this game is a blast you and your kids are going to play it a lot	5
0	i bought this for my 6 year old after christmas as her cousin received one and loved it i ran all over town trying to find the pvd 's \( which are hard to find a good selection of \) i ended up purchasing some online by the time the pvd 's arrived the player was no longer working we have replaced the batteries several times on a rare occasion it will turn on but that is very rare we are very disappointed with this unit i should have listened to my husband and bought the dvd player !	5
0	my 4 year old really wanted this for christmas after looking at similar products we chose this one should have spent the money on the one w the dvd tutu is way too small fits her 18 doll mat is a little too sensitive she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads only 2 instructions feet up feet down on the other arms up arms down bar is n't very stable company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat my daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it	5
0	i bought two bionicles for my son 's stocking at christmas he is 5 so i had to help him put them together it took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it it began to fall apart the instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks if your child just wants to construct them and display them then this is great if your child wants to play with them forget it go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life	5
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play	5
0	i bought this sippy cup seeing how informative the review was and i was happy when i saw it and my baby liked it but whn i went to wash it i cleaned the valve by removin a obvious piece that had to be removed to clean and it never was able to attach corrctly it will fall in her drink and completely get my babys face all wet so after one use i had to discard it maybe it was defected but i was not satisfied with it	5
0	i ordered the smack and yack disney cars sally lightning and ramone for christmas the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour they would n't work at all i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases	5
0	i helped my five year old assemble this and like most lego directions it went together well unfortunately it does n't stay together when he tries to play with it the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle not as easy to put back together once it 's come apart it 's proven a real disappointment	5
0	i just saw this today in 2 stores \( both priced at 19 99 \) and both stores had a lot of these games also ebay has a ton of these going for less than 20 ! this price is absolutely ridiculous ! ! !	5
0	people this is a brand new game out for the v smile system walmart has tuns of them in the store for 19 99 ! do n't waste your money ! this store is lying ! ! ! !	5
0	what on earth are you thinking \? nobody is going to pay that much for this game unless it has a portal to the deminsion of toyland	5
0	unfortunatley i am not very techno savvy i purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit wronge my boys told me otherwise when they opened up the unit and hooked it up this being ben 10 and the original unit being x men did nothing i felt so bad for my son he loves ben 10 and could not even use these cards	5
0	this marble maze looks so fun and cute however it 's actually useless and incredibly frustrating the pieces do n't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them much less when you try to roll a marble through them also the configurations pictured on the box do n't work at all either our giraffe is missing a critical piece or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate ugh i'm returning this immediately	5
0	i was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone the sound effects are very loud and crumbly and the microphone itself is a bit cheap the microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either cute to look at though	5
0	this was a real let down for my daughter she loves horses and has several breyer horses when we saw this paddock she was so excited about it we decided to get it for her for christmas it is very flimsy does not stay together and breaks easily she spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it after a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away only the doll and horses were salvagable	5
0	this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble he was so excited to see thomas riding the track well it worked the day we opened it and never again ! i would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1 2 the price ! you are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it \( eg crayon or dirt \) you ca n't get it out	5
0	i consider myself a very tolerable and patient parent when it come to toys with noise however this phone is way too loud for baby toddler it actually startles my 15 month old and makes him cry because it is so loud plus it is powered by the wonderful button batteries that do n't last this was given as a gift glad i did n't spend my money on it be aware that this phone is annoying really serves no purpose and is too loud for babies ears	5
0	of all of the expensive gifts i purchased for christmas this was the one thing my daughter played with consistently the price is right and now they have free shipping the one bad thing is that the cards are flimsy and we wore them out !	5
0	when i received the punching nun and removed her from the package her halibut fell off the glue holding her black cape on did n't hold either i would n't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up	5
1	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve after playing all 50 you can just start all over again ! fun fun fun game ! thanks	5
1	very nicely done brought it for my grand daughter who is 5yrs old and it is sturdy and has room to gro	5
1	my kids love this game they sit down together and play this game all of the time the neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and sorry is the one they choose the most we do not have video games at our house and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games now they come over all of the time just to play board games i say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games sorry is top game in our house	5
1	i bought this kitchen for my 18 mos old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it it is a nice compact size that does n't take up too much space she can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box my only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open but i know as she gets older it will become easier i would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child	5
1	this kitchen is not the first one i 've purchased i am more happy with this one than the other two i have purchased it has plenty of storage space for all the food and gives the child more doors to open and be more creative i am very happy with this kitchen it 's durable and a good buy	5
1	very pleased with this purchase my 2 yr old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen ! the kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very sturdy the telephone is fun and is actually my daughter 's favorite part of the whole kitchen ! i know of 4 other friends who have this same kitchen and all are pleased with their purchase	5
1	my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings they 've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them i realize this is not the typical situation i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid 's knowledge i had hoped for a game like famous authors which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players nonetheless the game is well presented it 's on the expensive side but the book alone is worth half the price looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones \? i recommend this	5
1	i received this game as a gift and it really is a great ! the book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'cliff notes' for the art history classes i had in school my eight year old daughter won the first game we played and i'm re learning lots of stuff i had forgotten highly recommended	5
1	my 16 month old loves her new groceries the produce amp amp sandwich parts are plastic amp amp each piece has a wonderful texture the canned goods are very interesting to read they are actually labeled by a supermarket in the uk so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the us i put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older she has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate this was a great purchase	5
1	this toy looks very appealing i purchased this for my son 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while i cooked cleaned etc he played with it about 4 times total and he 's 2 now ! it does n't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter i consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone i'm glad	5
1	wonderful product we bought this as a gift for my son 's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice he loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler so a real book was a huge hit he thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures his book will be a cherished keepsake and i'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown	5
1	an unexciting piece of value only to the completist collector \( like myself \) there 's nothing wrong with it it 's just that there 's nothing great about it either the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a holographic figure hasbro could has done better by choosing another host sculpt to base this exclusive off of the phantom menace version was much better	5
1	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve after playing all 50 you can just start all over again ! fun fun fun game ! thanks	5
1	just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey he only has use of his right hand this cartridge is perfect game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games he 's hooked is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short	5
1	this is really fun for adults we get together once a month and we really enjoy the company the food and the spirits this was meant for adults to solicize not for children i am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering i have really enjoyed bunco	5
1	i bought this for my three year old godson last thanksgiving and he loved it the pieces are bright sturdy and easy to grasp with tiny hands i 've purchased several melissa and doug products and i 've never been disappointed	5
1	my son love this toy it also reenforces this shapes and colors it 's a stepping stone for geometric patterns	5
1	this toy is so much fun ! i play with it every day with my sister brother altogether we have about 50 lps i have the most	5
1	both girls ages 4 and 2 loved this	5
1	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	5
1	i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i 'd never touch ! that is until i played it at my friends house ! now i'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions ! this game can never get old because it 's a different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older	5
1	this little motorcycle is cute however it 's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer the stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date none have peeled off the extreme shipping price added another 10 to the 19 99 price tag this is definately not a 30 toy	5
1	my 3 year old is very interested in space and loves this toy having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it the payload doors do n't really close the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on meets the need for a realistic shuttle though	5
1	this is a must have for your little sweetheart ! my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes it 's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next \) the accessories are cute but she 'd rather use stuff from mommy 's purse \) the purse is oh so cute too and durable my daughter is 21 months old she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since	5
1	this shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter my two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks ! highly recommended	5
1	the concept is more or less the same as the standard monopoly the product is good and is worth the price its nice to have the family members sit toghther and njoy	5
1	this toy is a wonderful first toy it captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they 're ready ! i absolutely love it and so does my son	5
1	purchased the batman laptop computer at target for christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old he was totally drawn in because it is batman but the games kept his interest the entire family enjoyed trying the different games dad a musician enjoyed the music game graphics are super i love the way batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even worth the 38 99 i paid at target on sale for sure	5
1	my daughter is 2 1 2 and she loves dora she loves playing with dora and the babies	5
1	my seven month old thinks the pots and pans are the best thing ever and i 'd definitely rather he bang on the plastic ones than real ones but i have to say that the songs are a little irritating and i find them running through my head when i'm trying to sleep	5
1	i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint he absolutely loved this set the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him the case is sturdy and great so he does n't lose anything the price ca n't be better for everything you get	5
1	i am so glad i bought this puzzle for my 3 year old ! the pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands this is one of those toys that you 'll want to keep forever	5
1	it is really expensive for what it is i have to say my children love it esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it i love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf however for the supplies you get it is expensive the tote itself is nice but not worth more than 5 add the supplies to it maybe i could see spending 10 however if you catch it on sale i would pick up a few they make great gifts	5
1	i bought this for my 3 year old daughter she loved it in the store and i thought it was cute i also agree with the other reviewers that there should be instructions for the stickers but you don't need to be a genious to figure out where they go i chose to not sharoen the pencil because she is 3 and i didn't think it was necessary for twenty dollars it is a good buy i know my daughter loves it and is having a lot of fun with it	5
1	very interesting spoof of the original game i found the first one boring after a few plays but this one still interests my kids and i after 10 plays it 's a bit convoluted to put it together initially but well worth it	5
1	i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i 'd never touch ! that is until i played it at my friends house ! now i'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions ! this game can never get old because it 's a different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older	5
1	every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime the characters on the game board are so awesome too queen frosting \( that was her name right \? \) is so pretty she was always my favorite character all in all it 's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child	5
1	we had so much fun with this game there are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions ! i definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even just a few people who want to have a good time ! totally worth buying this one	5
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen my daughter loved it when she was 1 now she 's turned 2 and she 's lost interest in it like many other baby toys i had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can cook with it	5
1	this was a great buy from amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping my just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of melissa and doug products we normally purchase them from tuesday morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper this puzzle has made my toddler happy he fits it together then dumps it repeating the process several times a day the drawing is realistic and there are no pegs so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece	5
1	i got this message from the recipient 's mother he loves it really ! well made drawer shelf design it 's heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies	5
1	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7 he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships he would say where his ships were this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game	5
1	my 3 years old son like 's it but put 's it together in no time not so hard	5
1	this puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it the container is a toy for itself	5
1	my 28 month old son got this puzzle for christmas and loves it he put it together the first time out of the box himself it is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day my almost 5 year old likes it too it is not as sturdy as the melissa doug floor puzzles but it still really sturdy	5
1	a lot of people look at this figure and say 'he has no wings ! ' while this is true i still recommend this toy an excellant hair sculpt and goku 's famous 'i have no idea what 's going on but be happy anyway ! 'look the wings are actually really cool although the halo has a job staying on 0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any dbz fan or toy collector	5
1	my grandson has truly enjoyed the easyscore basketball set from the first day he tried it wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he grows	5
1	i got this toy for my nephew and i know he will get alot of good years out of it	5
1	this made our 6 year old so happy ! great colors great markers	5

1	this was exactly what i was looking for to complete my little set	5
1	bertie is nice he has no magnetic pieces so he wo n't hook to other things nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he was n't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track	5
1	my two year old has several of these cars and the race track he loves all things cars so these were a big hit all of the shake and go cars talk before they run which he especially likes they are very easy for a toddler to operate but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them too they do n't run for very long per shake but that does n't seem to bother him at all	5
1	this board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable but a little small for go players who play avidly the stones are also small but they get the job done why i bought this board was because i wanted to be able to take it with me without a huge board dragging me down this fits what i want almost perfectly thanks	5
1	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son in law monopolize them with their little competitions these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy	5

1	my cousin loves these dolls she loves that she gets to be a little mommy to a boy and girl that 's what i love about this set plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing i do n't like about them is the hats i wish the hats were cuter \? i do n't know but it does n't matter i 'd buy these dolls for any really little girl she used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls but at least with these there is n't much to lose	5
1	we got this toy for my son when he was 2 1 2 years old he is now 4 years old it still runs like new he drives it like a champ we have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks it never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is i am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now	5
1	the doll looks nothing like the aidan in the movie actually his face is kind of funny looking the movie aidan is cuter the doll could definitely have been made better	5
1	my son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas he is now 4 and 1 2 and still playing with them it seems no matter what new toy he has gotten every morning i hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks i only wish they came is a larger quantity	5
1	the checkbook package was opened no pieces were missing but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift	5
1	i bought this for my grandson and he no sooner got it out of the box \( with help \) and he was outside in the sand with it having a great time cannot lose with these oversized trucks for little hands it is a good purchase	5

1	this is an awesome game the fun thing about it is building it its better than the rollercoasters because you dont just watch it going in circles it actually does stunts its also not so easy to its very ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! durable just keep it away from babies you have to order it off the internet so dont go looking for it at stores overall its an excellent toy	5
1	i purchased the mat to use with it and it works great	5
1	my son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it ! he likes to turn off the lights and give shows for the family we have not listened to the cds yet but i am sure they are a great add on my son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more i do n't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints in fact we are going to purchase some of the other packs available	5
1	the item arrived in perfect condition and right when i was told it would be here i am very happy with this product and seller would have no problem doing busy with them agai	5
1	the wagon is great as expected 5 stars for the wagon no stars for delivery it arrived with a dent though and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid february plus we 'd have to figure out how to re pack the thing which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent so we gently banged it out and spray painted the spot and the recipients probably wo n't care but it was a pain in the butt and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble	5
1	i had a radio flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it which is why i wanted one for my daughter we bought ours when our daughter was a year old and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it now that she 's four she loves pulling her one year old little brother around or posing for pictures with him in it we use it for picnicing in the local park or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn the wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos from the labor day block party to halloween trick or treating it 's a quot classic quot for good reason kids love it and never stop loving it	5
1	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5
1	my 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind when i found this activity set i knew he would really enjoy it he plays with it for hours the only downside of this is that he cannot keep up with the balls it would be great if this company would give parents or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life	5
1	i bought this for my son 's second christmas he was almost 2 it was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and i had to hunt it down 3 years ago he loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole ! he still plays with it and i will be buying his baby brother one when he 's big enough	5
1	my 18 month old has been playing with this for three months now and just loves it she even knows now which color balls goes in the correct slot she whacks them all in puts the balls back and keeps doing this over and over and over	5
1	my 5 year old twins really like this game it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings but that is why they like it so much on the other hand my 3 year old finds it very frustrating if you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage	5
1	my son loves these ! they arrived in perfect condition love that they are machine washable	5
1	my sister said her 3yo son loved and and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother ! i do n't really know how durable it is she lives in another state but said they liked it alot	5
1	my eight and nine year old sons are big lego fans i bought one set for each of my boys and they each built a different model both models came out great the parts fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well when played with the vehicles are even better than they look in the pictures on the box this was the first technic set that they tried i hope they enjoy future technic sets as much	5
1	if your child likes the wiggles like my 2 year old does then she 'll love this keyboard except that there is no volume button which i consider rude to the parents	5
1	my 23 month old son received this toy for christmas and it was one of his favorites he played with it off and on for hours woke up this morning and ran right to it it is n't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the songs from the show makes it more fun it 's not too bulky so it 's something we can take in the car overall we love it and would recommend it to any wiggles fan	5
1	this is the best game ever has over 100 000 words you can select your catigory and how many letters each time you get the word right you get points and they get higher and higher and if u get it wrong it gets lower	5
1	the test of a toy is if the child loves it this toy was perfect	5
1	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run this was an upgrade add on and well worth it the motorized elevator keeps the action going a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily safe pieces easy construction and good directions fun even for the adults	5
1	gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday i helped him to construct it from the clear \( no reading \) directions along with my 10 year old daughter the pieces go together flawlessly the engineering of the plastic is superb the elevator works as designed and the battery pack \( 2xaa \) connects via a short cord very convenient he has already spent many hours playing with it	5
1	i looked for years to get the bozo punching bag as it was a part of my youth finally i located it and purchased it for my grandson 7 he loves it as does all of his family who use it to take out their frustrations lol built very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well	5
1	i received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift i started to get into sudoku a few months ago while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go there are n't many buttons so it 's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work hope this helps	5

1	its the best table out there i did a lot of research and now have a year of testing we bought it for my daughter when she was 1 and she 's almost 3 i also run a daycare the chairs do n't tip and various ages from 2 5 have put them to their worst it cleans easily and is easy to put aside if needed i did have to replace a chair once \( i stood on it \) and the customer service was fast and friendly	5
1	we did not buy the refill but purchased the original set with sandbox it works wonderfully and my kids have played with it for hours clean up is easy another family i know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had a wonderful experience	5
1	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the classic collection children of all ages \( and adults \) can build ships planes houses whatever the mind imagines in a variety of colors the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character this is a great product	5
1	finally a way to buy just the lego bricks to build using your imagination i only have one but no more kits for me ! ! even the lego company on line does n't have this one ! highly recommended	5
1	this figure of the great wayne gretzky is a must have for those who collect hockey memorabilia the figurine is life like with gretzky 's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal what i love most about this toy is that you can purchase gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned if you are like me and collect gretzky memorabilia \( pictures cards jerseys etc \) this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection	5
1	i found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins do n't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys however the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit the hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he ca n't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to good ite	5
1	i looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person i took a chance on this one because the price was right and i'm very pleased i like the pockets on the front my son loves putting his books in out if i would change one thing it is the lid it is lightweight as to not hurt little hands fingers \( which is good \) but is never locked onto the toybox it lifts off very easily so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in other than that we love it	5
1	we got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one we love that it does n't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside it still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable if your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric we also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there we do n't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us highly recommend !	5
1	this is the toy with the background music and she 'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance	5
1	i ca n't say how great this toy is i mean it 's tall and the word he says is sweet pick it up today dont waste any time or and dont fall alsleep it 's just great in every way that 's all i have to say i mean if you dont pick it up you for sure will be sorry i hope this helped any one who was thanking about getting i	5

1	my daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this christmas morning of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play her grandma and i played and i was surprised at the amount of things i have learned just from taking her to her lessons ! i'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like trivial persuit but that was my only problem with the game there is n't questions asked every move but otherwise it is an excellent game i would definately recommend it	5
1	my five year old loves this has the cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember so easy for a little kid fun fun fu	5
1	i bought my girls ages 7 and 4 this product earlier this spring it was easy to assemble but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process it has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use when our play group meets here the kids line up to have a turn over and over again i would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands a very durable product and a fun physical activity	5
1	i love light sabers i got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play i bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool this saber is the best you can fight and the saber will not get damage i like it very much i got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight the light saber full extended is like 3 4 of a meter but it do his job the electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment the force be with you	5
1	our 2 year old loves thomas the train so this was a great gift for her she has other thomas items but they 're limited to playtime this however is not only good for playtime but safe enough for her to take to bed with her \( she even kicked her elmo out to make room for thomas ! \) it 's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides a great all around item to have if you 've got a child that 's really into thomas	5
1	my nephew absolutely loved the games in this nemo cartridge i did do because they are educational and teach him various things that he probably would have no interest in at least he is broading his horizons in a way that he enjoys	5

1	my 6 year old absolutly adores junie b santa brought her the leapter for chrismas and grandma gave her the junie b game she only puts it down to go to sleep there are a few games \( word searches and finding a noun verb adjective and great for 1st 2nd graders it is a great learning tool the software is set up like the junie b jones journal book if you child loves junie b she will definetly adore the game	5

1	i appreciate the previous reviews but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them my family ages 4 6 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game we played until we had a winner \( not too long \) and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner just our opinion but we had a good time	5

1	i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll doll speaks both english and spanish the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest	5
1	this game is fun for the family it 's very simple and can be played by young children learning to count it 's not overly exciting by itself but you can make it that way with your own spin on sound effects	5
1	this set is perfect for my daughter 's new toy oven \( miele \) that she received for christmas the pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans one of my utensils already broke apart but that happens i have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook but she is 3 and is not always careful not sure whether that utensil was n't made well enough or it 's a 3 year old 's play but the rest of the set seems fine i would recommend this and the miele oven	5
1	i was happy to order this early so they would n't run out but i later saw the same set at a local store there was only one left on the shelf so i'm glad i ordered them anyway they are my youngest son 's favorite cars to start off with every morning	5
1	i bought the bean bag toss as a christmas gift for my 22 month old son he had played the bean bag toss the first time at the halloween carnival at the church it was all he wanted to play that night i wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day at just three pieces it is simple to put together and take apart although it says it is for 5 and older it would probably get old fast for a child that age	5
1	this is a great game that is made very well it is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors it will last us many years i bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play it will surely be a hit ! my daughter \( 8 years old \) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it it has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty i would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children this game is best played on a table so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags	5
1	my three year old son is just discovering thomas and from reading other reviews and speaking with veteran mothers of thomas fans i realized how important collecting the different characters is in order to reenact the scenes from the videos this set made a nice addition to his growing collection and the price was nice too the wooden trains are a bit exspensive but are well worth it in the long run due to the fact that they will be played with for years to come unlike most other toys that children outgrow or become bored with almost as soon as they recieve them	5
1	me and my bf loves this plug n play game wheel of fortune we bought it at target store thumb up for this one and plenty of words	5
1	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
1	the lego community workers set met our expectations and even more the set comes with lots of different pieces and has made our lego experience very fun albeit a little on the expensive side this set is well worth it	5

1	the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child she had a great time using her magic wands to see what would happen with the bathroom playset having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool \( i assume so dora could step up to the sink brush her teeth \) pops out was a very fun surprise my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle the whole set was a great buy	5

1	everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic darth vader mask we bought it initially for my son who is darth vader obsessed but it 's quickly become the house favorite \( even grandpa ca n't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be darth for a spell \) on another note we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece it is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display	5
1	i got these for my 28 month old daughter for valentines day as she is fascinated by skating they are a pain to put on but she does n't mind they have beginner settings which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the expert setting ! what i like is all the safety gear come with them so she knows that she has to wear it all or nothing these are great and seem to be safe and sturdy with supervision of course	5
1	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	5

1	my three kids have loved this tunnel since they were two \( they are now 5 7 9 \) they still play with it alot they do a variety of things with it including magic tricks where the child inside will magically disappear it 's great exercise too to be on your hands and knees they also love to play tornado with it where one child gets inside standing up while the others throw stuffed animals into it meanwhile the child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does	5
1	this is a great toy for kids of any age we bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1 2 she still plays with it it folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside it still looks like new at my son 's 6th birthday party \( 13 boys 2 girls \) the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm while the other kids beat them with blow up swords yes i was supervising but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape even out cats crawl through it there are not many toys that are this much fun and durable	5

1	dond is a fun game and we 've had some lively sessions playing it there is an additional \( we forget we got rid of it ! \) complicated thing that the game had and made it less fun to play you also have to disregard the 'suggestion' regarding how to give an banker 's offer it does n't work so you have to use your own judgement to jiggle it actually this makes it even more fun ! all in all from 6 to 60 of we whom have played \( if you follow the 'disregard' suggestions \) it 's a 4 star fun	5

1	imaginext dinosaurs' t rex is quite simply fun to play with the dinosaur not only is a great toy with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar it comes with a catapult with its respective stones \( 2 \) that the caveman \( also included with accessories \) can operate to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino my 3 year old picked it up since he got it and he has n't let go	5
1	my little boy is a certified dino phile to the point where he 's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names \( ever tried saying edmontonsaurus three times fast \? \) but like any kid his favorite remains the t rex tyrant lizard king when it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys this is the most durable by far although we 've had the same problems getting this to stand at times as mentioned by another reviewer that has n't diminished my son 's enjoyment to top it off he 's come up with fun new uses for the toy too that catapult is very good at aiming at our family cat much to my son 's delight	5

1	this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc that is why i think it is educational to that respect my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along	5
1	i got this for my 2 year old for christmas it was a nice present he enjoys it 2 things though it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is it could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max and that is two 2 3 year olds it is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in big bird 's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money especially since i did n't pay for shipping	5

1	i read some of the reviews posted on this site before i bought this doll i saw it on ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought i should buy it directly in case i needed to return it but i had no problems at all other then the ubc cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way other then that i had no problem downloading anything and i ca n't wait to give this to my daughter for easter	5
1	my almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy it is easy for her to control my 8 year old thinks it is boring i do n't think it has any educational value the controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it	5
1	i am very pleased with this play food it is very realistic looking and a great size not too big and not too small like some of the cheaper sets definitely recommended and well worth the money	5
1	i bought these for my nephew as a birthday present and he absolutely loved it he has a number of other sets bu was very excited with the content in this one they were exactly what he wanted	5
1	this is a great house got it at toysrus has six ring tones at doorbell dog knock knock jibberish fog horn etc it 's so easy to assemble all you need is a helper \( to enjoy assembly \) and a power or ratchet screwdriver \( you need both \) the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill ! your child will love it swinging door window spongebob chair fits inside \( you can probably get a big screen tv in there ! \) great for the price 129 0	5
1	i purchased this house for my in home day care so we have lots of toddlers playing with it ! they love it ! the only complaint i have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it but the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs even the one year old loves it ! he likes to play peek a boo with the shutters lots of fun and well worth the money	5
1	this playset is great my son loves it you do have to be careful with the open sides it is very easy to fall off my only complaint was puting it together the instructions are horrible and have no words only pictures the parts are hard to tell apart \( the color coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions \) and the pieces are hard to handle give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help also a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic	5
1	this is a single player game set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated by the end the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before both kids love it ages 4 and 9 we helped the four year old learn the tricks by just asking whoes in that cars way \? then whoes in the trucks way \? until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards	5
1	i bought this game based on the reviews on amazon and i am not disappointed even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept the beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me	5

1	not only is the 90 's game fun and enjoyable to play but the questions and answers bring back lasting memories of movies sports tv shows and meaningful events from the decade correctly answering questions by relating them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to relive their experiences from the 90 's whether you were a student young adult or parent during the 90 's this game is sure to invoke sentimental feelings i highly recommend it for groups of friends and families	5
1	i thought this product was very unique it 's not as advanced as ipods which is great for younger kids although the only thing i did n't like was that it was a bit too small	5
1	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it he plays with it just about everyday everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too they all love trying to make baskets the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !	5
1	my son loves this toy it is the perfect height for my 14 month old \( he got it when he was 12 months and it was great then too \) he can play with it sitting or standing he loves to make baskets and i can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score he loves to spin the football and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat he uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house this toy is a family favorite	5
1	amazon com recommended this game for me based on the fact that i love the game set unfortunately xactika bears a strong resemblance to 10 to 1 a game played with a normal deck of cards if you already know how to play 10 to 1 xactika may seem derivative after trying xactika once or twice we threw it in the drawer and just played 10 to 1 instead	5
1	bought this for my boy who just turned 11 let 's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with two blinking lights on weapon one light on helmet which makes the eyes glow a little pricier than other bionicles but worth it not too hard to put together just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you do n't lose them while assembling the guy the folks at lego are geniuses sure it 's a franchise but they 're doing a great job keeping it interesting	5
1	i bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it right now it is in my game closet because i introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have pit night instead of poker night we can not stop laughing when we play this game we bring this to all get togethers and everyone loves it i had to buy my mom a new pit game because i take it all the time this game is soooo much fun the more people you play with the more fun it is ! ! ! get this game ! !	5

1	my girls love the sandbox ! the only thing my husband and i do n't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it we thought we 'd be able to but the walls are just flimsy enough that you ca n't otherwise a great purchase	5
1	i bought this sand box for my son 's 1st birthday he has had the sand box for a month and loves it it looks really nice in our yard and the top has kept out rain and bugs i was going to go with a cheaper sand box but now i'm glad i spent the money this is a very good product !	5
1	this game is so much fun ! ! ! i do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels in other words if you are a huge star wars fan like me then you will love this game ! ! ! it will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level another thing i think it could use is maybe a game save function or something anyway great gaming experience ! ! ! one and a half thumbs up ! ! !	5
1	my son got this for christma when he was 10 months old from day one he loves to push it around the house he 's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it his friends love it also	5
1	the nephews loved it we sent it to them along with other gifts for christmas turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift the light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball when the lights went out the fun really happened everything went well even when it turned into tackle basketball not their mom 's favorite sport but no harm no foul	5
1	this hoop is tight but wene you shoot it makes a ton of noise if your planing on buying this be aware of a lot noise also the hoop and the net sometimes come off	5
1	this eeyore is so much fun i gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose but if mom and dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach baby to keep them together i think there is also something to be learned with this plus the fact that he is so darn cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing good night baby just precious baby quickly learns that eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle i thought the ears would be easy to break but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work nana ka	5
1	the game pieces are very good quality i found the cards to be challenging the game was well worth the money	5
1	my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy when you think it 's pushed down all the way you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise also like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean but overall the toy is fun and very durable	5
1	these coins are nice and heavy they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch my son uses them like jack sparrow does in the movie so he does n't die in our play battles however they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped it would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real us currency that is large and heavy	5
1	this toy was an instant success with my son who is six he figured out how to put together the track in minutes unlike other construction toys skyrail is not limited to one or two designs my son can create endless configurations including loop the loops that really work this toy is also easy to disassemble the track and connectors seem a little flimsy but so far after many many uses none of the pieces has broken	5
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play this was how i learned how to play the game i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above \( 90 's style \) unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me	5
1	just as promised our son loves the wiggles plate bowl and cup ! perfect	5
1	as usual this is another quality product from power wheels the fit and finish is perfect and the overall quality is excellent the only upgrade i can advise is to buy the power wheels 12v quick charger for the battery	5
1	i purchased this pirate ship for my son 's fourth birthday this is by far the most popular toy in our house ! my 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy there are so many items that come with the ship from canon balls swords treasure chest full of goodies food animals and even jewelery for the pirates they are never bored my four year old plays on his own or with his friends and when all three are home they all play together definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home !	5
1	not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother in law ! quite realistic looking ! it works great on smooth surfaces but does n't do well on carpet our dogs got a big kick out of it	5
1	we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is we have mixed feelings about her my daughter 4 loves her hair because it 's so different from all her other barbies but she hates her feet her feet are way too big even bigger than ken 's \( my daughter tried making her wear ken 's shoes but it did n't work \) another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge \( good \) and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls \( bad because she ca n't use the other doll 's clothes \)	5
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it how could i not buy it for him doing that \? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house as he gets older he is liking it more and more	5

1	this product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the uk as a great teaching tool it was well received as a gift by the children and their parents an excellent math teaching tool that the children love it is portable user friendly and has something for those on many different levels so much so that one father an engineer loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son as well as a game that they can play together math whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge	5
1	i bought this for my nephew 's first birthday and my sister told me that he loves it when he gets up from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up it is a great motivator to encourage him to stand your kids will love this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused for hours	5
1	this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer i enjoy watching him do the math \( one with the coins \) as well as watching him make words	5
1	it is fun ! and most importantly educational it has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot my kids like that part they are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges next year my youngest will want one too i am sure as she wants to play theirs but she is just too little yet another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then	5
1	i do n't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews my kids absolutely love this toy they laugh hysterically every time and they 're 4 1 2 and 7 he does have a tendency to fall down and does n't scoot very well but the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money	5
1	my nephew cooper put on his superman suit right away he especially liked the suit is inflatible good choiceand excellent price	5
1	makuta is sooooooo cool ! i love his giant staff pitchfork i think he is one of the best bionicles there is ! probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo body special bionicle	5
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection we did n't use it as a game you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them yes the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue would buy this again great for kids with imaginations	5

1	my six month old grandson loves these toys ! they are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise they hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys they are easy for him to hold and shake i would buy them again in a minute	5
1	my son and i thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work this kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble the screws require more 'adult strength' \( he would start them and i would finish \) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble but hey that is why it was so enjoyable we did it together ! it is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my dad and i built this'	5

1	i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son did n't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time he also enjoys teething on the keys i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys	5
1	x4 metal detector rovernational geographic uncle milton 6 and up the yellow and black vehicle and its 5 foot remote cable crawls over sand dirt or grass lights and sounds alert the user when treasures \( coins old spoons jewelry etc \) are found it teaches kids about magnetic fields and also can be used as an ordinary play vehicle	5
1	this mcqueen is different than the regular mcqueen slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides it is supposed to be the mcqueen that appears after the radiator springs team fixes him up my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white i found out there was yet another mcqueen with the whitewall tires go figure	5

1	the v4 the newest american tamagotchi is much like its previous japanese counterparts the entama and uratama this tamagotchi goes to school interviews for jobs and then has a career each career has its own game so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail	5
1	i read the reviews before buying this product and i do agree that it is messy with the markers suitable for children that are a little older it is fun and very cute but a little messy to wash off i just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store and let the kids clean off the screen with them and then throw them out it works wonderfully and the problem is solved since the included sponge is not very helpful i would purchase this again especially for the price	5
1	anything leappad is great its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet my son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of leappad at 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly i highly recommend this and any other leap pad book and toy most schools have dropped phonics from the classrooms and leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love	5
1	we bought this and the sing along favorites and my 5 year old loves them both she would n't have know many songs on the other rom packs this is definitely a hit for the younger ones !	5
1	i purchased the miss weather dress up set for my cousin 's two year old daughter at her birthday party all the other gifts were forgotten as she sat and played with the colorforms the adults were waiting in line to play with them also ! this set has larger pieces which are perfect for younger children this is the perfect gift inexpensive fun promotes fine motor and speech language skills and has educational value	5
1	i would recommend this game to any and everyone completely i would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it 's sooo much fun most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few i would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products never got tired of the game and like i said i recommend it to everyone thanks b wolfwest chester p	5
1	the game itself is actully pretty good you can go through the entire price is right game or you can just go to each section like if you just wanted to do the pricing games there 's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc there are times that the graphics of the game lag which is kind of odd since to me since i was n't playing it on a computer but on my dvd player the pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games you can technically play this game by yourself but it 's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have	5
1	it was the most popular gift on his first birthday he loved pushing it sitting on it and moving the small animal figures lots of different kinds of fun for him	5
1	this is a nice toy for kids to ride on my daughter loves the little horn there are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music that does not work well at all there are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either it 's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features do n't work well worth the buy if a family is really into the john deere theme	5
1	i agree that the denver reviwer is totally out to lunch this doll greatly resembles my daughter 's friend jenny liu jeeny was born in taiwan chinese people do n't look any one way and to expect them to is racist like saying they all look alike the hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good the dress looks redder when you display her out of the box fabric quality is better than average for mattel her hair is also much nicer and has more style than mattel had been giving us i think this doll bodes well for better things to come in this doll series	5
1	i 've heard no complaints from either one it 's a hit	5
1	i purchased this for my son babies r us only because i had a gift card but i dont regret it at all this is one of kristobals' favorite toys from the peek a block collection ! my oldest son enjoys it also ! not bad for 20bu	5
1	i am confused by the poor reviews of this product my daughter received this toy from the easter bunny this year and the whole family plus grandparents aunts uncles etc have had a ball with it it creates huge bubbles round or long that float in the air for quite a bit of time i do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work but for the price i have to say this toy is well worth it ! we also made our own solution \( granny 's recipe \) and it worked very messy and sudsy though i would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles	5
1	my 8 yr old grandson wanted this for christmas but the price was over 100 so when i saw it for under 15 on amazon i got it for his birhtday in february he and his 9 yr old brother love it ! i also purchased one booster pack at the same time then i found another game and booster pack at target for a very reasonable price so he got the game system two games and two booster pack of cards all for under 50 00 ! both he and i were happy ! \( the only reason i give this a 4 is because the games are a bit hard to come by	5
1	my granddaughter loves the buckets they are large and easy for little hands to pick up they make great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the coordination of putting them on top of each other the colors are bright and the plastic is sturdy a great gift for little ones and older ones as well	5

1	this is a great simple fast game that is fun for all ages	5
1	i do n't care if it stops working tomorrow my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money \( you can get them cheaper at target though \) she was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone and now she has her phone she is just delighted she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk so far this phone works great but like i said it is such a cool toy i 'd go out and buy a new one right away	5
1	my infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets i'm sure she will grow into this toy i do wonder how i'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth	5

1	while nothing beats wood blocks \( in my opinon \) we had these first and they are fun ! we like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate and not painful if they fall on you ! the only downside is that they are large and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle they just fit storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box it 's worth the hassle if you have space for them and do n't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to	5
1	after assembling a dora 's talking cash register that scans the wrong items a dora 's talking backpack that is just plain dumb this is the toy that scored this christmas ! this toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker my daughter does n't even question why it only talks in the walker so what if it does n't ! it will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on i would recommend this toy very cute and fun !	5

1	my son absolutely loves his animals he can sit and play with the book for awhile he 's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs it was a great gift and i recommend it ! i do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs	5
1	this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby i 've used this toy in two different setting \( first as a nanny and then as a mom \) and both times the babies were terrified of it it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going unless of course you 've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls \( which seems to be half the fun for them \) good toy but not until maybe 14 months	5
1	my son cannot wait to get a bigger set compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is by far better quality although it is also more expensive	5

1	i think that the soccer ball is great but not that educational only because all you do is paint	5

1	being a preschool teacher i use these all of the time i have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them even if you do n't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages large unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way for infants toddlers and preschoolers i will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color paint glue to their hearts delight	5

1	my niece is about to be two and she loves school buses so i thought this would be worth a try she loved it hours of fun and if you are patient you could fold it back up and put it back in the box	5
1	bought for 2 year old twins it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party the only thing that does n't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time definitely a great gift	5
1	this is the greatest thing i was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn not only has it lived up to my 3 year old but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play it has not torn it sparks great imagination all her friends go to school now this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also and best of all we can store it anywhere when we are done she has even learned to close it up and put it away i highly recommend this bus to all ! !	5
1	i first became aware of eat it through an article in the washington post my family enjoyed playing the game so much that we invited the creators of eat it to appear at an event in our local community it is a game that truly the whole family can have fun playing together my seven year old daughter emma was thrilled to learn that one of the questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called fat emma and was hoping that it was still being sold \( it is n't \) great game	5
1	it 's a nice pool a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well lol it 's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot of water it 's just hard to dump it all out once you 're finished that drain hole should be on the side and not on the bottom of the pool	5
1	i think that this was a great item something unique from what i can usually find around here my daughter loved it like any other polly items lots of little pieces but overall very nice i was a bit miffed when i found out that the photo booth really does n't take photos i guess i should have thought about that a bit more overall it 's just fine	5
1	i love the luke fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely it is light and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real i would not even dream of fighting with it i would think it would break in a few days of fighting there is not much to say except it is the best fx next to the darth vader and it looks cool in the dark it is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off	5
1	i love this chimp and i am an adult all the kids in the neighborhood come to play with it it is so realistic	5

1	my son received this as a christmas gift and loves it took a little bit for him to understand how to work it only down fall is that it wo n't run on carpet requires hard floor or table to sit on goes really fast	5
1	i read about this rc racer in family fun magazine and it got best toy for 10 12 age group and they were right ! it is alot of fun to put together not too hard but a good challenge it can also be made into a different model we went online to lego and got the directions it is also sturdy maneuvers speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds of terrain including snow jumps the battery has given us about an hour of hard driving the remote is alot of fun to use i loves it its spendy but i 've already had hours of fun	5
1	my 2 year old loves it though one set of grandparents ca n't stand the noise so if you do n't like noisy toys obviously this is n't one for you otherwise its great ! runs out of battery very quickly though	5
1	i bought it for my grandson who is 4 but my granddaughter liked it better then he did and she is only a year old she kept hugging it and trying to dance with it	5
1	my 9 month old received this for christmas and loves it ! he is not quite crawling yet he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy so far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze the voice and phrases it says are so very cute too we love the little giggle and when it says hello baby ! ! this is an adorable toy	5

1	this was the best stocking stuffer ever and we got 4 one for each of us mine is know at my office and my boss loves it	5
1	my daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday even though the box says for ages 7 and up and even though she 's not the most nimble fingered kid she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help the materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick colorful yarn the loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time she enjoys watching me knit but does n't have the dexterity yet to knit herself so she 's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like	5
1	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it his little sister who is two also loves this game this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept there are no complex rules to learn so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off	5
1	this is the best game for the beach and the car the little letters clip right into the board it has a zipper case also it 's great and we enjoy it very much	5
1	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory	5
1	i love this playpen ! ! durable plastic can be extended to larger size \( or shortened if going someplace that is not as large \) only problem is that my baby loves to wander she is not thrilled when mommy cages her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary crib toys can be safely attached on the sides \( did that with her aquarium toy which she loves and it soothes her \) occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her i just put her other toys in for her to play with	5
1	i bought this mostly for the container i had individual play doh products like the barber set that came in it 's own box i'm able to put all play doh things into this container and everything is in one spot no more boxes and sorting i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience i'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !	5
1	these dominos are great for the hello kitty lover my six year old loves them do n't be fooled by the picture though the tin is not full if you ask me there are not enough of them in there the tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full i would have rated it five stars if it had been full	5
1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1 and 2 year old children it 's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my 2 year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my 1 year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up	5
1	i'm not one for guns in my household but my potty training son really wanted this blaster gun he 's a total star wars fan \( like his father \) and i told him that he could have it if he said good bye to diapers he did so we ordered it and waited for the ups man to come he was so excited when it was delivered he thought the ups man was so cool for giving that to him ! anyways there is so much detail on this blaster gun the sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red my son loves the sight scope too ! big hit in our household ! ! !	5

1	the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable and the sounds it makes are truly neat my daughter got this over a year ago \( she is 7 now \) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs	5
1	the doll is wonderful and my granddaughter thinks it is her best birthday gift i also want to especially compliment and thank amazon for their excellent handling of this purchase i made a mistake when ordering and they very promptly helped me to correct it i look forward to doing business with amazon in the future	5

1	i love this motorcycle and it is a no duh that it does n't run on fuel really think what fuel are you going to use plus fuel is hazardous to children and a company would n't threaten the lives of innocent children ! that 's my opinion	5
1	my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain he was n't able to assemble it alone eventhough he 's typically very good at assembling most other toys it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together	5
1	this costume kit was a great deal for the price my son loves it	5

1	previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point in a panic i ran to check the three i have purchased for christmas gifts 2002 all three have volume controls now ! do n't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products friends have these and my girls begged for their own as a home schooling mom i prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational leap frog is my best source	5
1	the game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults this makes it great game for the whole family to play together the images from the quot i spy quot book illustrations are bright and creative they do n't match exactly for instance there might be two images of cats but borrowed from different photographs in the i spy books so there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up this is a much more attractive memory game than most and would make an ideal gift for a child or family	5
1	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way there is a lot more room for more logs 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front i ended up buying additional logs \( not lincoln logs \) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	5
1	i was very happy with the lincoln logs i ordered for my three year old grandson he has been enjoying them they seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building my grandson has still been able to build something that he likes thank you for making it available	5
1	my children are 7 5 and 20 months and they all love it the baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit the humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises	5
1	my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors i like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen ! it has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile it was a little difficult at first for my son to handle since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast the colors are pretty cool the faster it spins the more colors come out \( primary yellow orange colors \) i like that it holds his interest a could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow !	5
1	this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family ! it is very fun and great for little ones too ! i own this game and my family enjoys it very much this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson 's idenity i love this game and i think you would too	5
1	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen it has a contrast adjustment but it not very helpful it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast	5
1	i purchased this item for my 4 years old neice she is dora crazy as my 6 year old was at 2 and 3 years old my daughter has the older version and she still plays with it it 's her house for her and her dolls my neice is also enjoying her dora house great gift it does not take up too much space you can slide it under a bed behind a couch etc dora house is great !	5

1	7yr old son has had many many hours of fun rebuilding this into many different tracked and wheeled vehicles quickly lost interest in snow monster part but the vehicle part is easily changed around for new setup each time highly recommended	5
1	my 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents so we went and bought this toy at target \( and paid 30 09 for it \) he loves it his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time my only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries \? \? \? what are those \? \?	5
1	many people are not time oriented i have used this both in the classroom and at home it allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past i tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something i set green for 20 yellow for 7 and red for 3 i do n't have to say anything else this eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson	5
1	we wanted this little doll for our own little ariel she is perfect for the bath tub ! she comes with her own float wand with bath tints and swim coverup ! ! her bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has a baby powder fresh scent \( which we were not expecting my husband is not to found of that \) we are very pleased and hope that this company continues to make baby princess items ! ! !	5

1	this item showed up on time and without incident i'm not sure what else i can expect from a pair of novelty glasses	5
1	we all love this toy what i like about it is that it 's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it 's sturdy \( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard \) it looks good not cheap and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes this has been the big hit this christmas even more so than tekno puppy	5
1	my son wanted this piece and we have enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so i have to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to our geo trax railroad	5
1	my daughter is 2 1 2 years old and i often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing after dinner i find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine she has learned how to button use a zipper and problem solve by using this book also i find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible i have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it	5
1	our whole family loves this game i like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover i also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice the construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy we added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better	5
1	we gave our nine yr old grandson this train for christmas he had a such a good time putting it together then running it on the track the train absolutely glides on the track so quietly and smoothly it is a great product	5

1	the remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use one button makes the car go forward and one turns it around the third just makes reving engine squealing tire sounds not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler this car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great it is a very durable toy that is simple to use it is a great first remote control car	5

1	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon it looks really cool and can change also the little ball launcher \( i forget what it 's called \) is a lot of fun \( i shot my brother with it x3 \) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it does n't really get in the way	5
1	as a brilliant but ruthless leader of the piraka zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure the mask of life ! all the piraka have two tools yes 2 each one has a zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot but in real life they would be the size of basketballs zaktan 's three pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal nothing will get in his way or it will be severely punished	5

1	i 've been thrilled with the car so far super fast and super cheap at this price it could be a little more responsive when turning but otherwise great lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9 6v pack by newbright as other person said works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass i bought it to bring back memories of my old tyco turbo hopper from childhood and it did a great job at that	5

1	we purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was 3 years old she absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build she had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart we then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be even more creative it is an excellent lerning toy not as simple as it seems	5

1	you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy \( or wanted a trailer for the truck \) but this is an updated version of the original character as opposed to a remake and is superior in many ways it is durable detailed well articulated and fun especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot i 'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike	5
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey there are no other ones like it they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth they love it	5

1	as with all the leap frog products this ones a lot of fun packed full of learning surprises i have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it 's 'work' the birthday surprise is fun and full of rhyming words that make little one want to learn i have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating because of the quality in all their products learning last a lifetime so get them started with fun friends from leap frog	5
1	this case is nice and tough it holds all the accessories for the fp3 player securely i gave it 4 stars because i think things like fp3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great it matches with the player and is built to withstand kids i did take a star off my rating because as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by it should really have a handle little hands need something easy to hold on to and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose i could see	5
1	i bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib he moves around a lot in his sleep so i wanted a safe first bed for him he absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before the only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high so we just use the mattress for now eventually we 'll put the box spring back in	5

1	my granddaughter requested this for christmas and i had a hard time finding it until i checked the amazon site it's just what she wante	5
1	i purchased this train case for my son last christmas \( age 6 \) it is very sturdy with handle i like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply easily those moms like myself when your child has finished playing there is now a place for them to put their trains in the 'metal' case is a great added bonus the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case next play time the trains are all in one spot thomas come up with a place like this for the track i need it	5

1	my kids \( 4 5 and 1 \) love this car the sounds it makes are great they take turns riding on it and the other one pushing it is quite durable and they play with it all the time only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off overall it 's a great toy and the kids play with it every day	5
1	he 's into firetrucks and mickey mouse so you could n't ask for a better toy it 's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything but also durable enough to play outside with it 's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he 's playing with at night \( most days \)	5
1	this is the optimus prime that should have been made 20 years age it was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging finally nostalgia won out and i had to transform him it was amazing the transformation took time but it was worth the wait i felt like a kid again i am totally satified with this product	5
1	theres a few things the are nice about this prime and things that arentpros extrem detail coloring is good megatron rifle is sweet mouth movescons primes regular gun will barley fit in primes hands bit more platic then die cast a pain to transform pushing legs in most of all sound base sounds like a ultra magnus mixed with primei can find more cons then pros i would only get this toy for some one 11 or older not somebody who goes all wild and takes there toys every where oh wait another pro ! primes leg vents open when you stand him u	5
1	the instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out you had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target otherwise i it is holding up great so far !	5
1	my son saved and bought this with his own money very durable great for catching practice my son is always in the yard playing with it	5
1	i 've been wanting this forever and when i got it it was totally awsome ! ! first it comes with a really really cool chair \( that you are going to love ! \) it also comes with a sweet guitar with amp \( fyi the amp has some really cool stickers on it \) and it also includes two \( 2 \) guitar magazines i truly love this piece mainly because i 've always wanted an amp for my guitars oh i highly highly recommend this you 'll love it ! well hope this helps \)	5
1	i purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson i knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it it did not lose it 's charm for 11 year old boys through the years my grandson was thrilled with it as well just enough challenge to keep their interest	5
1	our three asian american granddaughters got these today for christmas and they love them ! ignore the 5 star reviews that trash these cute little dolls then try to steer you to ebay for another doll these are the genuine article and kids love them as they have for generations our thirty plus daughter in law still has her original cabbage patch doll and she still loves it just as her daughters loved theirs today	5
1	the game is fun we played it when we lost electricity during hurricane isabel and was kept entertained ! i dont know if i would take everything in the game as seriously as everyone else is writing bad reviews if you look to a board game for truth in life youre not going to get far ! this game is fun and makes you think and re think what you think you know ! i suggest it for teens	5
1	my daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday she plays with it all the time ! ! ! it did n't come with any tapes and honestly she does n't need them ! she spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice it is so funny ! we all get a kick out of it there are several different sounds to choose from even her two year old twin sisters get into the act they love it love this toy it 's extremely durable would absolutely recommend this	5
1	i have a three year old son he loves these take along toys we take them every where with us the tracks stay together very well we move them from room to room and never have to take them apart we have almost every part of the take along thomas the train items	5
1	i played this game at a super bowl party and decided to order one for myself my 8 year old loved playing it and we recently took it to a family reunion and everyone there liked it too	5
1	the game is good for all ages the train sounds are really great for kids it is fun for a holiday or any kind of group gathering	5
1	yes all the princess need a prince to fight over we had a blonde to do the honors but the girls are much happier having 2 competing males to do the honors his clothes are easy to get on and he is as dashing as they come need to find one more less european prince to finish the collection	5
1	this emperor penguin puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old we almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy pal this penguin looks round and pregnant but to my kid this penguin is a perfect friend he has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys but for some reason this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination	5
1	i just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me \( mom \) lol can really make use of all the options however overall i really love this toy but yes i had to convert my office room into the geotrax room be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up its very hard though since it all is so coo	5
1	i was very pleased when this toy finally arrived the blue devil is removable and semi posable \( his arms move \) he is the same size as the simpson figures from the playmates line of toys so i feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind the homer donut eating action does n't always work correctly the mouth and donuts are n't correctly synchronized so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth but that does not detract from the fun	5
1	classic durable fun educational for kids of all ages including me	5
1	the 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family but we soon got bored of the same video over and over we could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money	5
1	my six month old enjoys this it can keep him occupied for 10 15 minutes at a time and the music is quite pleasant and soft good toy	5
1	i bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it ! the music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights it has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot i got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is i do n't think it is worth the original price i would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale	5
1	this doll is cute and fun to play with my daughter loves it i like these dolls better then bratz they need to make more dolls that are dressed the way kids are i think that lil does im happy and my daughter has a toy i think will be around for a long time	5
1	it is a very nice product i bought if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him i put in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his teachers my daughter says it very useful and he is adapting to his nursery quicker	5
1	this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it it plays pre programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols \( like my daughter ! \) and it really is pretty we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played it also does a pretty light show i cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3 6 year old girls	5
1	my 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents she loves the disney princesses and was ver excited i was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down she plays with it in her room almost everyday and i love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep overall we are very pleased with this tent although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that i could play in there with her	5
1	i was disappointed when i opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than i expected it to be my friend 's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger apparently there are two different kinds one made by playhut and one made by the disney store	5
1	i gave this as a gift to a friend who is a huge fan i 've never seen a 29 year old so happy as he made the whoosh noise as starscream flew around in jet form great quality durable and fun to play with	5
1	i just gotten this yesterday for my 12th birthday and i love her so much ! she is beautfiul and her hair is so soft the clothes are adorable and she comes with a poster that comes in a accesorie bag for all of you bratz kidz accessories ! this doll is the best ! i am going to get the other bratz kidz for christmas ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5
1	we received boggle jr as a gift at christmas my daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game she is learning her words and is learning to spell this is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words i told my sister and she requested it for her son he 's a happy camper with the game too	5
1	my son is 4 1 2 and he loved the set he and his dad set it up on christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell i would recommend this for kids any age	5
1	the suduko board game is the perfect gift for the older kids on your lists it is well made and can be played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being played by middle schoolers or college kids also i paid 17 99 for this and have not found it anywhere near this price it is usually 29 99 to 39 99 for the exact same game	5
1	my little cousin sarah loves this toy i bought it at wal mart in springfield it works with or without water and features realistic sounds i am now on my way to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean	5
1	my 6 year old loves this yes it is small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right on a shelf when not being played with i would get it again if i did not already have it	5
1	my 6 year old loves this toy she made all 3 bears at one time my husband helped her they are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re stuff them	5
1	we bought my son a couple of starfighters the tri fighter the at rt and the wheel bike he loves the starfighters and likes the at rt a little he rarely plays with the wheel bike i think the starfighters are just simpler sturdier and easier to play with the wheel bike \( and to a smaller extent the at rt \) are more complicated and thus less fun for a 5 year old we run around having mock dog fights with the starfighters but poor old general grievous sits in the toy box overall probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff but not all that fun for the younger guys	5
1	these blocks are so great ! they 've gone through their different stages of growth they learned to reach for them peek inside grasp them toss them around and now stacking them to make towers my triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year love them all	5

1	this product is fun for the whole family i hope my kids have as much fun as i did with them when i was young	5
1	we originally bought this game at the chiricahua national monument in arizona for our kids \( 8 and 10 years old at the time \) and they loved it we love that it 's monopoly but one that creates interest in visiting our national parks	5
1	i think this a great item for a child over 3 1 2 since there are 4 puzzles in one box our son who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate they are symbol coded on the back so i think once he gets older it will get easier he loves the pictures and i love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning highly recommnde	5
1	my daughter had a 12 dancing princess party and she loved the game it 's a little tricky for her to do the set up but she enjoys playing it	5
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle when my nephews come over they always find these and they 're 5 and 7	5
1	we are huge blues clues fans and this is our favorite blue ever ! his is really big and sooooo soft ! this buddy is much more cozy than the smaller beanie baby version he is a great cuddly no frills \( no buttons to push or batteries to replace \) buddy ! my toddler sons love this blue	5

1	bought this for my 2 1 2 year old for christmas and he loves it all you have to do is press a button on the back and it moves it 's head and roars very easy for the young kids to do and my little guy loves it	5
1	my children loved this toy for all of \( 1 \) hour my only complaint is the material you can probably guess this punctured almost immediately i made sure to clear debris beforehand and it seems something very small wounded this toy i've refilled it but i'm a little apprehensive on where to let my kids use this it seems that it takes very little to disable this toy	5
1	this is my favorite game of all time this is the kind of game my family and i love to play at our beach house every morning it 's a great family game really for no one over mabye seven i recomend this to any family who loves a great game to play with the whole family	5
1	my one year old has had this toy for about 4 months now and it 's still his favorite toy there is no end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps coming up with new ways to play with it it 's hours of endless entertainment !	5
1	we 've had one in the house for a few years now the kids \( 5 and 2 1 2 \) love it it 's soft cuddly and sized just right for them it 's been taken all over the place has provided companionship for them on many a long trip \( including two to south korea \) given comfort when they are sad and been used for countless hours of make believe its worth has been far more than what was paid for it	5
1	a great way to save kids artwork i use the pockets to organize by grade it is great	5
1	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it he helps with the house cleaning i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch sprays water and pretend buttons he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet we play iron with the water when i have time this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time sigrid manon blake ramire	5

1	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend the quality is what i expected works fine	5
1	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list	5
1	we live in alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play we found them for purchase on amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to alaska although we are part of the us and usps ships for a reasonable price we were n't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been ups and fedex rip off those of us in alaska while usps treats us just like everybody in the lower 48 give us a usps option	5
1	we purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size meaning the food would be closer to real size rather than miniature it was we also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use that remains to be seen but the stuff is made well and i cannot see it breaking unless you deep freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer nice texture nice flexibility pretty realistic looks the child it was intended for \( age 4 and a bit \) plays happily with it even the older boys \( 10 and 13 \) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it	5
1	i have two boys 10 and 12 the younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun he had at the website the older one asked for one for his birthday the website is very kid friendly you wo n't have to worry about what they will see on this website it is great fun and even i play on it ! i highly recommend this for any age child	5
1	wow ! this is an excellent deck that lets you automatically get the harpie lady cards and as well as a monster card based on one of the characters from legend of the mystical ninja	5
1	but i like sasha and jade better she 's cute though she has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute ! her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design her skirt is a strange black pink and gold pattern her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow stone in the middle her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them thanks for reading my review ! hope you enjoy her	5
1	our son plays with this board while i'm feeding him he 's only 20 months but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him it 's well built arrived in only a couple days our son loves it !	5
1	we bought this set for my seven year old boy and we were a bit dissapointed there are better magic kits out there for the price for older children \( look at the marshal broden kits by cadaco \) if you have a young child is is four and five though this is a great set the tricks are easy to work and they are big for small hands anyone who has any magic sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as exciting as many of the other kits	5
1	my 3 year old opened this for christmas and loved it who would have guessed that this little car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive things he was given ! it does n't get stuck on any surface that we 've tried it on and drives right over things in its path which my son thinks is really cool ! great toy for a relatively inexpensive price	5
1	no bells no whistles just an action figure with its' own four wheeler it can capture the mind of a car obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least \) some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to hold do n't stay in his hand very well but oh well it seems that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway ! and it takes that quite well	5
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together	5
1	i was very pleased with the order and the speed at which it was delivered more important my grandson loves it it was what he wanted and could not find it here so was very glad for amazon	5
1	more track is the first thing you 're going to want to buy after your first geotrax train set it will seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the track design to reality the switched pieces work out better as the child gets older \( 3 4 \)	5
1	i think the hair may be a bit over done but everything else is right on i like the make up and the clothes and she does seem to resemeble veronica from the archie comics i remember reading as a child i give her 4 three quarter stars \( it would be five if the hair were better \) she's still a great doll though nearly perfect ! ! ! ! !	5
1	i love this doll but the only complaint i have is the eyes why are they looking to the right ! mattel please if your gona make more then please put the pupul in the middle pleeeeeeeeas	5
1	easy to follow instructions for set up and play very intuitive the only thing i would suggest is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder' playing on their team to have a shot at the questions on old people events etc if they 're real sports history buffs then it 's not an issue	5
1	love it ! the questions are great the party mode is great entertainment	5
1	my son calls this a flute and rather than argue we let it go but his little hands have a hard time holding it \( he 's 4 \) even i have trouble i'm right handed and the right hand keys are on the bottom i do n't know if that 's how real clarinets are but it 's awkward also your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play so that 's also a little frustrating but the sound is great and it 's fun to play once you get the hang of it	5
1	this toy is awsome ! i truly recomend this to you and all your friends ! ! !	5
1	we purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles he immensely enjoyed both as a matter of fact the adults were quite taken with it too	5
1	nursing nana is a great gift it is soft and cuddly and the puppies attach with magnets giving a realistic nursing tug as you attach and detach them this would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby it is a bit smaller than i anticipated but it is still worth it because it is well made	5
1	i am in my twenties i had one of these dogs when i was little and i loved it it shows kids the way dogs naturally feed their puppies of course it is only a stuffed animal so it is not going to do anything but in my opinion it is a very cute toy for a dog love	5
1	this is a beuatiful dining set true it does n't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product description but we have too many already anyway i would recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use this with other doll houses	5
1	i keep this on my desk at my office people love it and it a lot of fun to watch them during the day i highly recommend	5
1	i bought the sea monkeys on mars for my 7 year old son he loves them they hatched easily grew quickly and are quite cute he loves to feed them and watch them swim they are eductational and fun	5
1	webkinz hippo arrived in an exceptable time frame and in good condition i will definitely order others	5
1	this was a super soft animal and one of the kids in my life ended up with it being and aunt grandma a lot of them end up in new home	5
1	this is a fun toy for anyone who is a starwars and mr potato head fan	5
1	a retooled mold brings this 60s sci fi kit back to the hands of today 's kit builders ! not quite accurate to the sets miniatures of the original show the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats the control yokes are not included with the pilot 's console plus the top dome is round instead of teardrop shaped but these are all true to the original aurora model would n't take much to fix the mistakes as there are plenty of references replacement decal sheets out there or just build it as is for nostalgia value	5
1	this is a great game for two players \( and two players only \) the first one or two times i played it was very very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in however once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you games tend to take about an hour it 's a fairly involved game so you have to be in the mood for that there 's a lot of strategy and many ways to win i greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games it might be daunting for a really casual gamer though if you like it there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original	5
1	i bought this for my niece and it arrived within a few days in great condition it was still in its original box and it was n't dented or anything	5
1	lots of fun for young children my kids ages 2 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets	5
1	of all the toys our son has gotten this one has stood the test of time for over 2 years he has consistently sought out this train to play with it has survived being dropped on almost a daily basis and still keeps going highly reccommend	5
1	this is a veary fun baseball game i first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun i got it for myself ! ! ! ! !	5
1	a great game for the whole family my visiting swedish friend enjoyed playing so much that she bought one to bring back home with her if you like sequence you will have fun with kings in the corner	5
1	our family played this game a lot during the 60 's we had a blast with it i did n't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6 it 's a blast for family fun	5
1	this was my first schleich world of knights figure given to me christmas of this year it 's a highly detailed classic dragon with no moving or detachable parts \( the wings are an integral part of the figure \) as such it 's safe for very young children and you do n't have to worry about someone 's eye getting put out as to its historical accuracy and educational value i really cannot say never having seen dragons in the wild but the level of detail is wonderful and it should encourage children to obtain the more practical members of the balance of scheich world of knights collection which are excellent as well	5
1	i recently purchased this game using a gift certificate my little boy loves it i think it 's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards frankly there needs to be better proof reading was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the usa that would probably account for it	5
1	we had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one my girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make the music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them \( ages 20 months and 3 1 2 \)	5
1	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game but once learned it is a lot of fun a good game for four players and a great game for six players it generates lots of lively action with the bidding for the cards we played this game on a cruise with four strangers they were no longer strangers after the game everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it that 's how we got it bought the game after playing with family	5
1	we purchased this game for our son for christmas he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess he has enjoyed the game all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition it is an attractive box we are very pleased with every aspect of it	5

1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge the only downside are some of the very small pieces definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3	5
1	well this is the expansion for settlers of catan and a lot of things have changed the ability to build military forces adds depth to the game as does the city improvements the abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone the expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours my only complaint is that in several games the barbarians have not beaten us once they are way too easy however this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own all in all this makes a great game totally awesome	5
1	maybe it 's my computer or browser but the picture here does n't do this doll justice i bought one at my local drug store before i saw it here at amazon i can tell you that this beach glam barbie is gorgeous ! the picture here looks faded to me but i have the doll right here in front of me and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo	5

1	this is a great barney musical songbook and can also be used as a play piano it 's great that it has an auto turn off after non use however if it is turned off and something touches it it automatically turns on by itself many times after the kids went to bed and we happen to put something on top of the barney sing 'n play songbook it turns on by itself because the songbook does not have a physical turn off switch and something touches it barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep just wish it has an on off switch so it will not be turned on accidentally otherwise my 3 year old loves it	5
1	my son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago when he was two it was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own he loved it and played with nothing else for a week ! the songs are cute and familiar to him plus barney talks and sings to the music the only draw backs were that i could n't find an off button and that it is 20 at local retailers i wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack lol	5
1	this schleich haflinger is a good buy schleich is as detailed as breyer and are as big as breyer paddock pals this haflinger stallion is a palomino with a shaggy mane and tail this horse is full of personality and is well worth the money your kid will love this model horse	5
1	i do n't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with she has such a pretty dress and vail her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem i would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me i still really want him the barbie with blond hair is also very pretty	5

1	my little granddaughters loved receiving this especially after they figured out the sandbox works best when not dumped on each others heads and the lawn	5
1	i give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons first humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus and second the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set my mother sent this toy as a gift for my son 's first birthday the package suggests this toy for ages 2 5 and in typical fashion my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself but my three year old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy she began role playing with the dinosaurs right away i love you very much said the mama dinosaur to her baby supercute	5

1	i just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls \( 3 and 5 \) with it today it does blow tons of bubbles ! they love chasing them all over the yard the gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out it does used 8 aa batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor yes it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you do n't use so many batteries where i 'll plug it in in the backyard i'm not sure yet i definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles	5
1	my son loves the imaginext dino collection he has almost all of them they 're durable fun and educational	5
1	this thing is great our 4 year old loves it the working drawbridge breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great considering the size and number of pieces it was remarkably easy to put together allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly but the directions are excellent only complaint is that some of the small pieces that do n't always want to stay together some of the details will likely be missing after a few weeks overall very happy with it	5

1	there are so many great things about this that i do n't know where to start availability price shipping the list goes on and on bottom line is that my daughter is a big care bear fan and it 's impossible to find this bear anywhere else it arrived quickly was just as described \( in fact it was softer \) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter 's bed i give it a 5 only because that 's the highest makes a wonderful gift ! !	5

1	we recently purchased this playhouse and discovered that it does not come with the peek a boo shutters \( i do n't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description \) our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it but i would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually do inside the house the doorbell makes fun sounds it is very easy to put together	5
1	even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen	5
1	my 3 year old loves this toy he has a lot of the krypto toys and getting mechanikat was essential we just got it for christmas so am not sure of its longevity it does seem to be pretty well made also got snooky wookems with it great for fans of the krypto cartoons	5

1	we have this up on the wall for our baby and use it as a diaper changing night light the luminosity is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for sleepy eyes my 9 year daughter also loves to cycle through the phases before bedtime the room has to be very bright for the night light to turn off automatically the remote is very handy and we liked the 3 viewing options we 'll be getting this as gifts for our friends and their babies	5
1	we have the original quot super mastermind quot which is the exact same layout it 's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache it 's fun to watch others work at it too the pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it it 's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts	5

1	it 's cute well packaged and easy \( but time consuming \) to put together for the price it ca n't be beat too bad there 's no photo she 'll use it for a while and we 'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back	5
1	this is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old she loves this pool i love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water it stands up less risk of tears or holes ! the only thing i would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one	5
1	my daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it this pool is big enough that i can just get in with her and we have a blast because of her age i do n't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine \( it just looks a little funny \) i found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away i was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments i had it put away and every time i use it i find it easier and easier this pool is great for traveling to grandma 's house too ! i would recommend this to anyone young and old	5

1	i bought the african american 2005 holiday barbie for my little girl i agree with her statement that she 's too pretty to play with ! ! mattel did an amazing job this year the face on this doll is exquisite miss 2005 is absolutely proportionate in classic barbie terms the gown 's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit in fact the ball gown as a whole is supernaturally beautiful picking bob mackie as this year 's designer was nothing short of genius when i saw that mackie was the holiday designer i knew that mattel had finally gotten it right !	5
1	this is a great toy i play with it all the time and it still works	5
1	really nice toy but i do n't understand why there are only 3 knobs on the grill but there are 4 burners i think this might confuse some of our future fast food employees	5

1	my 2 5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey i decided to try this more affordable kid 's tunnel instead it 's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels but it has been serving me great for just about a year there 's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it but it 's still very usable my ratings would change a bit for kids though probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability	5
1	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 we bought a lot of m d toys and this by far was the better of their toys even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out like other said the sound is very appropriate i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful	5

1	great idea to hang clothes the hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on if your child is like mine who loves to dress and re dress dolls the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits the price is great now i paid 20 great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer	5
1	my 3 yo twin boys love this but one station is a little difficult to maneuver it is very sensitive even for my 6 yo boy all in all i would recommend this for all those little train lovers !	5
1	my son loves this game when moving around the tracks in the one game it can be difficult the key is if you moving up or down depending on which direction you need to go push the joystick the direction once and let go after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go i hope this helps my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks mom dad and sis had to play before that the other games are a little easier but i found the games educational and my son loves it	5
1	my child loves this little crib i think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers she can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room all her dolls fit the crib we really think it works it is n't as sturdy as a wooden crib but it has n't come apart on us	5

1	now you can add risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition the game remains a perennial favorite and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone atleast not physically but be prepared for a few bruised egos especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims while the places and names do n't exactly match today 's geographical boundaries kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out	5

1	i found that for the price this set was great ! it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go 3 and a half feet there were also some improvements in the pieces for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set	5
1	we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it ! he does n't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them overall this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder we ca n't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun ! ! lego always makes great and challenging toys !	5
1	whenever we take this bike to the park boys and men of every description crown around it in awe my son who is seven and so far not athletic at all loves the recognition not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching we just wish it came in an adult size	5
1	it was what i expected and it came in time for my grandsons birthday	5
1	my toddler and all of her friends love this play house it is great no assembly required	5
1	i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004 he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house he does n't really use it much anymore but now my 18 month old loves it ! he can actually follow the whole progression turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time this toy has been great for our family it is pretty durable some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore but considering what it has gone through it has performed amazingly well	5
1	toby is one of the regulars on the thomas his friends tv series and this little wooden tram engine is well made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets my only complaint and this is very minor is that toby is a bit taller than other wooden thomas engines meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well	5
1	if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong	5
1	i like the language tutor and the music stuff ! i also like the screen savers ! it 's given me great ideas ! i play with it in a different way than you are supposed to like if i need a story starter i go to the magic act and read the sentences for an idea	5
1	our family loves this game and has played it for years the tiles on this version are smaller than the original and some might find them difficult to handle if you like scrabble you will love this game !	5
1	even better than scrabble you build words on the board and build words up by adding letters over existing words so tree becomes free and braces becomes blades the scoring might be a little too easy but if you 're hard core you can use the point values from scrabble to raise the score difficulty the board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game and the game does n't drag on for too long it is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again	5
1	my daughter \( age 13 \) really enjoyed this game it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that	5
1	it 's soo cute and cuddly ! not only is extra soft it 's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk it looks realistic too it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the ty tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face	5
1	this game is awesome ! it is addictive though so be prepared a little complicated once you get started but becomes easier best if someone already knows the game to teach it really fun though	5
1	this is a great game ! using clues to get others to say the secret word another great classic game brought back by endless ! a	5
1	i purchased this for my daughter a bit before christmas and she loves it it is a great item for the price and does what the bigger brand names does thank you	5
1	this is a very good webkinz as the plush and as the virtual pet it comes with a rare tv and other supplies it is also very soft the only bad thing is the price do n't buy webkinz online the price can go up to 50 the real price is 11 99 which you can find them for that price in stores	5
1	sure this does n't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals but it still works well and has been copied by many companies i even have one with a business name on it these fun functional and keep a kids imagination engaged no noise or batteries needed buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year	5
1	my 9 month old granddaughter likes her christmas present of octotune as a matter of fact we played with this toy yesterday when i stayed with her it is colorful she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing so it stimulates more than one sense	5
1	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
1	i bought this set for my grandsons 2nd birthday my son found it very easy to assemble and my daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of furniture my grandson loves to sit at the table and look at books or build with blocks this is a sturdy set that will last for many years	5

1	we received this for my daughter 's 4th birthday it has been a lot of fun to play simple enough for her to play and hard enough to grow with her for the past year although it has a lot of pieces they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers	5
1	my daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it it combines the classic board and memory games together the pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable the only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily we have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box an excellent game ! !	5
1	well i got this ahwile ago i got this toy and i was very excited i made the blanket but it was a hassel the glue did n't work and the instuctions are a bit ocnfusing but it is fun when your done ! !	5
1	my 8 year old son loves this toy he has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth he likes the food dish that shoots the disc and also thinks the cryptonite is cool ! ! ! it says it changes colors when warm but we havent seen that maybe nn to run it under hot cold water \? ! overall a fantastic buy	5
1	insta sundae in a can simply take the can and squirt some of the stuff into a bowl cover it in whipped creamand chocolate sauce put a cherry on top and voila you 've instantly created a sundae	5

1	this play tent is great my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later he brings toys in there and hides to play it is not unsafe it will tip over at times but it 's so lightweight that it could not hurt him i think that it 's a great buy for the money and would recommend it	5
1	my 3 1 2 year old son has older sisters with ipods and always wants to use them to listen to we bought this for him for christmas and he calls it his ipod and he absolutely loves it we download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward we also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home it 's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out	5
1	it is an okay seat my only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole pummel thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him we started him in it at about 4 months he sits in it for only short periods of time he gets uncomfortable pretty fast otherwise a decent chair	5
1	i 'll start off by saying that this is the company to buy naruto headbands from it is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone 's head \( trust me i have a pretty big head \) the insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly a velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate does n't touch your forehead and cause discomfort in other words this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself and for the price it is a very nice addition to any naruto fan 's wardrobe	5
1	i got this for my 3 year old niece she loves it and requests that it go with her all the time the box to hold all the pieces is handy the magnets are easy and there 's lots of variations of outfits having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends parents etc to play along and interact the only cons i see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy it could use a handle and the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit all in all a great gift and toy !	5
1	my 3 year old daughter has this dress up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated enough yet to dress and undress actual barbi dolls she loves changing their outfits and switching their accessories and i love that she can do this without any frustration mellissa and doug toys are made with the quality of older toys they are well constructed and made to last and the sturdy box allows for easy clean up and storage	5
1	it is a little smaller than i expected but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand other than that it 's perfect my son 's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box so far it 's worked out great ! i do n't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small do n't bother me the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank	5
1	we recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we could n't be happier it is sturdy and durable a hard combination to find these days looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly ! ! it only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great our son ca n't wait to get up and play yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin i will purchase more of these for the different toy areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift	5

1	i was unable to find this product until now and it was great ! ! ! delivered fast and absolutely no problems ! ! ! !	5
1	my son is 11 and loved this he was very proud when he built it by himself it is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it \( gently of course \) this is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series it is also a classic piece in that it does n't have a cartoon or charter theme	5
1	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product here i am fulfilling my promise they were able to pedal the bike within 2 3 days of getting them they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car \( 89 chevy camaro \) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns	5
1	my daughter \( 15 months \) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll which was a gift from my best friend i 've never seen her react like this to any gift my daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware the doll has a soft squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has as my husband is constantly saying a hard plastic head	5
1	my son needed this gun to go with his halloween costume needless to say he was thrilled with it it has held up under a lot of use and the noise is not too loud and irritating	5
1	my son \( 5 year old \) chose this toy as his reward and was so excited when he received it he and his brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are all star wars fans it has a realistic appearance and the sound is not irritating as are many toy guns highly recommended	5
1	this toy is awesome i am a starwars fanatic so i 'll get anything starwars but not cheesy like the darth vader voice changer overall this toy is great	5
1	i bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now she still plays with it all the time it is by far her fav toy the only problem is that it 's a bit too load and no way to turn it down or off well besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids my daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it	5
1	the is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games i have ever played the first time we played was on christmas day we had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it we played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat it is also a great way to break the ice i would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner this game ca n't be beat	5
1	okay we all know about the disney cars craze and trying to hunt down all the new die cast characters mattel puts out these 1 24 scale models are very very nice and the size is perfect for young boys girls or collectors the only downside is that they only made mater and mcqueen who would n't love to see chick hicks or the king in 1 24 scale \? ! come on mattel ! get with it ! !	5
1	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
