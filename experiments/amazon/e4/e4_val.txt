1	these are great blades installation is very straight forward the only gripe i have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1 2 but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke but it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars i guess there are no replacement for factory blades	6

1	i bought this compressor with the intent of airing my tires back up after a day of 4 wheeling for this purpose it works amazingly it comes with an awesome carrying case and everything else you would expect with a portable air compressor it will air up my tires quickly the specs state about 4 minutes to air up a 35 tire when running the compressor is pretty quiet and does n't vibrate and bounce around the built in gauge is quite accurate once the unit is turned off in short buy this air compressor if you have any use for it at all it will easily beat compressors which cost over 3 times what this unit does	6

1	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6

1	this is my favorite wash to use on my car it suds extremely well holds the suds well and the smell of it is quite pleasant i was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes leaving you with a bucket of dirty water obviously not too good for your car ! with meguiar 's nxt everytime i finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles i highly recommend this product	6
1	we love our lund tri fold ramp ! it 's a great product at a great price ! it 's very strong yet lightweight enough that one person can handle it we wanted a ramp that was one piece for stability its solid design offers good traction along with worry free loading of all items no worrying about anything slipping through like it could with an open ladder type ramp the anti slip rubber pads and safety straps make it very secure the longer length provides a more gradual incline than standard ramps this adds to their versatility around the home they 're so handy for moving items even up and down stair	6

0	this piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it 's dead and it 's really easy to charge and use problem is after i had used it a couple times the cheapo plastic clamps both snapped now they ca n't grip on the battery terminals under warranty but so expensive to ship \( shipping not covered by warranty \) that it is n't worth it great idea shoddy construction all vector have these same plastic clamps so try to find one with metal clamps	6

1	i bought one today for my mazda tribute because i did n't like the built in cup holders it 's actually very sturdy and fits very well	6
1	what is missing is that the product gets free refills from zymol for life so if you use a lot of high end wax then this will pay for itself in a few years and yes zymol makes the best wax i 've ever used	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6

1	i installed this in my mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived \( which was very fast i might add \) it fit perfectly the height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon so it did n't require a lot of adjusting that way the bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely i 've had my three boston terriers back there numerous times now no escaping possible ! i had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this but they were 3 times the price ! this is a great deal	6
0	the oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case and the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil maybe you 'll find this product wonderful and a cost effective alternative what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine \? a small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil	6
0	i also purchased this product was extremely disappointed when i found out it did not work like the 1st reviewer wrote it basically is a mini fan that moves but it does not cool the car down at all ! there was absolutely no difference in the temperature of my car after i installed it ! don't waste your money	6

0	i had been wanting this for 2 years due to having a cracked tail bone several times in my life when i saw it at this price i bought it right away i'm here to tell you not to waste your money ! i only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when i sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever it was a big disappointment	6
1	take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire	6
0	the product would not put out enough current to help with the drain on my battery i think i purchaced too small of a unit for my needs may work well with a smaller type of battery not on a car battery	6

1	just a comment about the eagle talon comment in order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics i have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy i was a jeep eagle technician for many years even though it says eagle on your vehicle it is actually a mitsubishi eclipse that is why the connector does n't work at the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars \( there were others \) also obd1 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like abs etc if they are not linked we also had different connectors and equipment for different systems	6

1	goes on easy and wipes off super amazinglyl easy and gives a very nice finish i 'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts but the application was a pleasant experience one thing they said it does n't get the black trim white but it looks like it does the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after i applied it it is possible that it is from my previous wax but i do n't think so since i covered that with mother 's back to black product	6

0	maybe it depends on the car but i could n't get it tight enough in my suv to prevent the dogs from knocking it down it also probably depends on the dog if the dog really wants to get past it they will if you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a psychological barrier this would be ok oh and as a previous reviewer mentioned the trombone style sides slide easily back and forth i had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place	6
1	rated best polish in consumer magazine and probably is one of the best the problem is it does n't work unless driven by a human who 's going to invent a car polish that works by itself	6
1	i 've lived in oregon colorado and now the northeast and seen my fair share of snow i got one of these from a friend two winters ago and it 's the best tool for snow removal i 've used i still have my ice scraper since this wo n't remove ice but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18 24 inches that we got in the northeast last year i'm buying one for some florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year	6

1	this unit does exactly what it says reads the codes and allows you to reset the check engine light it also has software to intrepret the codes but this is very basic in nature and you can find the same info on the internet or from some car mnufacturers the unit is very well built and easy to operate	6

0	this car seat cushion 's foam padding is not only paper thin but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts \( i'm not kidding \) placed in some of the cushion 's massaging bubbles this makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine ! i threw my massage cushion into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing	6

1	this is the best ! ! ! best store best service fast service and great packageing i will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	6
0	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	6
1	it was simple to install on top of my rv i was able to put a cover over the panel and keep getting the sunlight to charge the batteries it charges even through glass on the inside of the rv	6
1	it does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location i had to remount move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position the forward backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me	6
1	very impressed so far used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly never impressed with black and decker tools but i think they got it right this time time will tell and i would have given it 5 stars if it holds up for a few years	6
0	listen if you truly want an ionizer that dramaticaly changes the air i strongly advise people to purchase one by flair this home unit retails for 300 need results that 's what a real one costs	6
1	the code reader is a very good device with an excellent price i fix my car and i saved money the diagnostic for a car is almost 80 dollars in the auto repair shop with that money i bought my own code reader	6
0	this item performed as expected reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with obd ii connector easy to use only 2 buttons ! you might be able to find it 10 cheaper at a local store on sale but even at the price i paid it was a bargain ! cost of tool 1 diagnostic visit to local shop	6
1	this is another nice tinkerbell accessory for the car the graphic is nice looking the material appears to be good quality i expect it to last for some time	6
1	i used one of these water blades at a school car wash and was sold the parent that brought the water blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it used it a lot it does not remove all the water you still have some small amounts that will require a towel but this is a small amount we used it on 20 30 cars at the car wash to pre dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great ! purchased one for myself so i guess that 's a good recommendation	6
1	it is always hard to judge a product by a picture they looked dark on my computer but i ordered them anyway because i liked the graphic i am so glad i did they are actually a steel blue and they look great i am very pleased and have recieved many compliments they were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations i would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys	6
1	great for cars that no longer install ashtrays example honda traps all odor once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it 's also easy to use at night i do n't think it 's a great ashtray but a great disposal system if a ld light was installed it would be even better for nightime use	6
0	this product does not cool down the car it is too small i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks if you buy this please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe	6
1	received product as described within several days of order item is excellent quality and does the job	6
1	these little dots work great and stick anywhere the light is very bright watch you do n't blind yourself i sometimes have a little difficulty pressing so the light stays on but usually after 1 try it 's fine	6

1	works fast and good this is a great charger anybody can use this the voltmeter and of battery indicator is nice i do n't have to check the battery with my multi meter hav n't used the alternator tester yet but have no doubt it works by far the best charger i 've seen and used however it is noisy but who needs total silence in a garage	6
1	works great everyone needs this tire gauge it is easy to use and easy to read	6
1	we got one to use on our cars a couple of years ago it wipes them almost dry it does n't scratch because it is made of silicone now we are using it in the shower and have to buy another for the cars i'm getting one with a handle to dry my camper too i recommend them highly	6
1	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	this jump starter has the capacity to jump start diesel engines and everything else i 've used it on i only wished it came with the cigarette outlet cable that is an option if it also had that i would have rated it with 5 stars	6
1	this is an excellent starter kit wish i could buy more clay separately as the have plenty of the quikwax if you have very used clay this is absolutely worth buying and trying	6
1	meguiar 's nxt tech wax is easier to use than any other wax i 've ever used and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red honda like no other as well buy it use it love it	6
0	it worked for me ! my car is now a blistering 120 degrees as opposed to the scorching 121 degrees a month ago the only thing i ever got out of this product was screwed i 've been bamboozled ! ! do n't believe the hype stand up against the man ! chumps unite ! god ! what a piece of poo	6
1	i recently bought one of these to put in my wife 's car the kit is pretty complete and well organized you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but i liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor the bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it wo n't slide all over a carpeted area	6
1	i had a check engine light problem with my car i purchase the meter and it was able to determine the problem via the code i was able to fix the problem with 1 4 of what the dealer charges the meter saved me hundreds of dollars highly recommend it	6
0	this includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item who 's actually going to put this on their car \? it makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away check the picture see anything messy you have to stick onto your car \? misleading and a waste of money do n't buy it	6
0	i seriously hope that the price tag i am seeing is \( 7 000 \) is a mistake	6
1	this is the best car wash i have ever used ! ! ! ! ! along with the nxt generation car wax it makes your car look like it 's had a brand new paint job this product is a must for people who want the best for their car	6
1	what can i say \? mothers makes great stuff for auto care and this is one of them just make sure you read the instructions and do it right also this is not going to raise any death from its grave it the wheel is pretty busted it may just not have hope	6
0	if you have tinted windows this product does not work	6
1	it 's what i will need if the car battery is drained i hope i never have to use it	6
1	saved me twice so far tow rope got me out of a snow bank has almost everything you need some things are kind of cheap but in general the product gets the job done	6
1	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
0	it does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it i would n't suggest this product	6
1	an excellent product i bought one for my mom then tried it and bought one for myself a great back support	6
1	ordered 2 cables from dln they shipped quickly keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged they are good quality and work well i like that it charges the phone as you sync up highly recommended and at such a good price	7
0	the price is high considering that there are newer models	7
0	i bought this for my new samsung slider phone \( which i love \) but this case is to snug for it the slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out it 's a cute case i would love to use if it was just a little larger	7
1	we were deperate for a charger the local stores seemed to be out of them and we got it overnight as requested unbelieveably fast thank you thank you thank you !	7
1	i bought this case for my lg chocolate and it is perfect the belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare the pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts the front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets the bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the chocolate 's end button this allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case the only dislike i have is the name cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal i would recommend this case to anyone who owns a chocolate	7
0	poorly made and weak pulls the battery off my razr everytime i disconnect it from the holder stopped using it within a day after purchase there are better holsters for the razr on the market avoid this one	7
0	i guess you get what you pay for so i was n't totally surprised that the battery did n't work what was worse is that when i sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a part of what i paid for it do n't do business with these guys and do n't buy this battery	7
1	i have had this phone for almost 2 years now i have dropped it many times still works in dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants i let it dry out for 1 day and guess what it works i am still using it as it works perfectly even the camera i used my sisters razr phone this weekend and i hated it the redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable i will be keeping my samsung for as long as it lives	7
0	i ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters i got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown the shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so i am not going to pay to send them back i never got an e mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e mail to the company i will not buy any thing else from them	7
0	this product does not work ! ! ! ! ! ! it is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer i wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer no way ! the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it i have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work i dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is the disk has 40 files on it i dont know if one of the other drivers would work but i am very frustrated	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
1	this belt clip was exactly what i was looking for and the price was great	7
0	well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it	7
1	as usual motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all it 's more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal	7
0	i purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr l7 it does n't fit the case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone do n't waste your money	7
1	besides all the functions described above the cable has one more function it can be used as a charger too ! this is really cool the company 's service is great for every order i put i received the products within 3 4 days at the price of ground shipping fees	7
1	i recently got this phone and love it t mobile 's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself for all the people saying that it is n't really magenta it is the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades	7
0	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
1	the holster that samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster how stupid is that \? why would samsung supply this type of holster to their customers \? however this holster has solved that problem you can now flip open your phone when using this holster thank yo	7
1	you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it	7
0	i cannot believe how poor this product was made the hell with this product noboday noooooooooboooooody buy thsi product talk about poor	7
1	the product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly	7
1	i received my phone and everything was good when i looked at my bill amazon did not close out my previous 2 months i had left on my contract with cingular so cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of 30 i called and had it removed	7
1	i just bought this battery at a sprint customer service store and i paid 64 64 with tax in california i can buy 4 of these batteries here at amazon i'm going to return it today and buy it online here should have checked first	7
1	the product came promptly and i am happy with the quality however fitment was n't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo not a huge problem but something i would feel everytime i reach for the stylus but the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands i would definately recomment this product to others	7
1	i have trouble to buy from bestbuy but i ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product ! thanks	7
1	these replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus	7
0	due the lower price of the charge i decide to buy it but it does n't work on my sony ericson w300i at all bad inversio	7
1	ive always stayed away from the flip slider phones because im good at breaking things ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong the mini sd port is awesome	7
0	i bought this product about a month or two ago and i still have n't been able to figure out how to use it i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use this product seems to be a lot harder unless it 's the wrong data cable which it should n't be since it 's advertised as an env data cable	7
0	when i first got this item i was very pleased it was so cheap and it looked great it snaps so easily on and feels really cool however after about 3 weeks the duller not so shiny coat that i liked on the cover started to come off beneath it was a very shiny black coat i was so disappointed i took it off and went with my original cover it looks really bad and just looks like something i 've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks i am very displeased with this item	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	i recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network i have so many acessories for this phone i did n't want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one i had thanks	7
1	i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life i had to charge my old battery everyday i only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days	7
1	the pack is quite as described any one of the three itemsmight justify the small expense	7
1	comfortable easy to put on fair to good sound quality full charge lasts approximately 2 3 weeks fully compatible with blackberry pearl and motorola razr nice style with black and alloy accents some callers claim to hear echoing not the best sound quality \( i like logitech better	7
1	i think this would work better with a money type clip however since verizon does n't carry anything like this in clear this works	7
0	the charger i got did not fit the motorola v188 wrong connecter i was offered a full refund	7
0	the skintight cover is cool works pretty well with the unit but the belt clip sucks ! it 's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	after hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work it eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again my opinion is to stick with the oem cable the extra money 's worth paying to avoid the headache	7
0	this product was listed as being for my phone when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models it was misleading and it never worked even messed up my phone a little and i lost 5 00 in shipping because of the decpetion	7
0	i have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price i thought my fulfilled contract \( i am on month to month now \) meant i could qualify for a new account and keep my number no such luck after wasting a few hours dealing with cingular and then someone in india on behalf of wirefly i had to return it it is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer ! i will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though i would prefer the 750	7
0	i would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort the 2 5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active i tried both adapters \( i bought the 2 pack \) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose in positive news the connection at the 3 5 mm end is nicely snug	7
1	i bought this case for use at work i work in a semi dusty shop environment i'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well i do n't have to worry about the screen getting scratched \( the screen on the sansa e2oo series scratches very easily \) with the hard plastic screen protector i am very pleased with the speck toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co workers	7
1	after talking to cingular i found out that i would have to spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807 to my laptop but the only package they had included headphones which i did not want i foud this cable on amazon and saved 30 you can download the software needed from and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan	7
1	this device works great i use it on a usb laptop to charge the treo 650 i also use it on a wall outlet and the car no problems the cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient it does not come with a case so you 'll use your own bag or whatever the part that fits into the treo is very secure it does not pop off like other chargers the only thing i can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged	7
1	from longviewer 's advice i got this case and he was right on ! ! ! ! awesome custom fit ! ! great case for the money thank you ! ! ! gar	7
0	i owned two of these earbooms the fit was comfortable and the sound very good however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	7
1	hey this is a great phone i have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly i have never owned a sony ericsson phone before but i am really happy the camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception definetly a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one	7
0	i bought this usb cable for cingular my lg cu500 but does n't work with it strongly i do n't recommend this others	7
1	after reading reviews here user forum 's i decided to purchase thisdesktop charging station it can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment and can chargethe extended life batteries as well while the q is on the charger the three color led indicator is added benefit w a simple guidethat is located underneath the unit the charger can not over charge the battery which is an added benefit and you can easily access the q while on the charger for sms texts using any app or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger	7
1	this is not an all in one package this is just the cable and driver you will likely need some type of additional software to actually do anything with the phone check out a freeware program bitpim for that i have a vx8300 the cable works the driver works bitpim works	7
1	great product exactly as advertised thinking about buying a couple more in different color	7
0	i dropped my treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case	7
0	i owned samsung t809 months ago and i was very frustrated because the bluetooth does n't work well sometimes it has connection \( bluetooth \) but most of the time it does n't work yeah ! it 's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one	7
1	i love this phone i can do so much with it it is light weight and fun to carry i love the button flip feature great phone ! !	7
1	i 've been using this phone with the net10 service since march and have to say i am very happy with it coverage areas have been great i do n't use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go although the phone does n't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have it gets the job done	7
1	kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector does what it is supposed to do	7
1	this similar unit is 1 4th the cost of the official phone belt clip that verizon sells for the lg vx 8300 and it is just as good verizon sells it for 19 99 taxamazon vendor sells it for 01 4 99 shippingbottom line it is just a piece of plastic that gets the job don	7
0	i think this is the worst nokia phone i have ever had it just does n't seem like it 's nokia quality to me i would get the samsung slider if i could do it all over again battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough the interface is pretty smooth but that 's about it if you have to have a simple interface then this might work but otherwise i 'd get the samsung	7
0	i do n't know about you folks but i have small ears though the sound on these ear buds are good i ca n't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they 're too big for me and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords good idea badly designed for size differences	7
0	although this charger is suggested when purchasing the verizon razr the phone complains that this an unauthorized charger and it will not charge the phone do not waste your time with this	7
0	the color of the product i received is nothing like the picture ! if you want royal blue then this is the case for you	7
0	i owned samsung t809 months ago and i was very frustrated because the bluetooth does n't work well sometimes it has connection \( bluetooth \) but most of the time it does n't work yeah ! it 's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one	7
1	this is the 5th palm treo case i have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far it holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap the clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot it is slim and works great	7
1	this car charger for the blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price it is well made and works perfectly i also use it to charge my motorola bluetooth headset that has the same usb mini jack	7
1	top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily	7
0	i bought this item at the end of january and received it in febuary it is now march and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry i bought this i am going to order another color and see if it does the same not very happy with this	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
1	excellent price for the charger original motorola equipment shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item shipping was very fast i definetly will continue to do business with amazon and a1 accessories very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience	7
0	these are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from i sent mine back	7
0	i got this phone cause i thought it would be a nice little phone wrong yes it plays songs yes it is little too little ! ! ! ! this phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers the voice dialing does not work ! it is hard to use i returned the phone after only 2 days ! i got the samsung t629 totally better does almost everything the nokia does but is better looks better performs much better if you are a teenager this phone may be good for you the samsung even sounds better get the samsung same price more phone	7
0	apparently you need to quot know quot your technical specs universal does not mean nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it does n't work with nokia i get the expense of sending it back this should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site	7
1	works just fine ! delivery was earlier than predicted i am well satisfied i looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they did n't have them i was told they can order one i thought to myself so what so can i this was much easier i ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my door no muss no fuss this is the way to buy such items ! thanks for a great job	7
0	i have to return this order motorola not some off name brand it doen not fit the phone it says it fits	7
1	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a treo 650 so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the treo 650 skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a treo 650 i also see they have these for the blackberries	7
1	the sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others the bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first \( and my neice used the extra buds for her mp3 player and loved them \)	7
1	great phone durable and so far dependable i did buy a larger battery there is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk i do n't know if it is the service or the phone	7
1	this case has good quality construction and fits properly it solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case two things kept me from rating it 5 stars i prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses i also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which i find less cumbersome while working the fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning this is still the best optional case if you want to use the mp3 player feature and require the use of earphones	7
0	battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time	7
1	the computer recognizes my phone when i plug it in but the drivers on the provided cd are pretty much worthless	7
0	the only support i received was to send me to a competitor 's homepage and try to download their software	7
1	if you 're the type of person that does n't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i would n't pay over 40 bucks for it it 's a nice basic phone the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones	7
1	i was so easy and fast to order and the person i bought it from seemed to make it easier i have had no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchase i would definitly buy again	7
1	i highly recommend this bundle for the price for less than the cost of an offical verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a usb cable with driver cd everything works just fine the instructions for the usb cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use windows media player to move music over to your phone using the sync feature and you can use a free program such as bitpim to do other file transfers between your pc and phone	7
1	car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter the design is basic with no hidden features you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device otherwise a perfect gift !	7
0	i am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up instead i cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug and play	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
1	it is small and compact easy for travel but also good for home use	7
0	i bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk they worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit	7
0	i 've used the headset for a little over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance there was no notice when it disconnected recently the plastic ear clip broke and i contacted logitech and was informed that since it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headset a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies logitech 's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant	7
1	many people are having issues with the 2 5 mm to 3 5 mm adapters and treos this adapter works fine in my treo 650 the plugs fit fine \( i got the 2 pack \) and i get stereo sound through both headphones if you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will not get stereo sound my crappy panasonic headphones and better sony \( isolation \) headphones work fine with this adapter maybe i'm just lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine if you want sterling sound you should n't be listening to mp3 anyway i can hear the limitations of my files on the treo so it 's clearly good enough	7
0	i was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own the cable itself is o k but i had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it 's definitely not intuitive and definitely not plug and play support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor 's website to locate the drivers on my own also \( and with no offense intended \) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you	7
0	the headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wo n't work with the katana the case is absolutely worthless do n't waste your money on this product	7

1	i like the way it does n't take up space in the console when i am not using it and it seems to charge the l6 just fine ! no complaints with the devise or the service from amazon	7
1	good purchase although i have not used the headset yet the case and charger work perfectly great savings amazon is the place to shop for a discount	7
1	the device works fine and i do n't feel i over paid sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable	7
1	i agree with previous reviewers \( gely zencity \) regarding this cable the price was right set up was easy and \( with the bitpim program \) you can communicate with your lg vx8300 efficiently i loaded my whole outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones do n't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from verizon 's sites \( vcast and such \) just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music tones that you already own	7
0	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
1	i paid 1 4 as much for this product and it works just as well as the name brand product	7
1	this cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere i received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the samsung website works great	7
0	i bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk they worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit	7
0	the software that comes with this is not the right software for the vx8500	7
0	cool concept and everything but when i tried to install the driver my cd rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little cd	7
1	i bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmasi upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the gps servicei love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used tooverall this was the best purchase for the price i ended up spending almost 900but i also had the bluetooth essential pack the gps and some other featuresthis is the best phone out period no the iphone is n't going to beat itthe iphone does n't have a slide out keyboardthat 's soemthing i do n't want to part withi would like to see the iphones operating system though ! but the 8525 takes home the trophy ! ! !	7
0	title says it all phone falls out clip swivels badly justtrash	7
1	cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around 17 i would recommend this case	7
1	for the price this cover is great it 's thin easy to dial through and see through easy to get it on and off no complaints i just wish i had it sooner before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen i have dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine	7
1	products exceeded my expectations the charger was n't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable i was n't interested in the case but after i got it i found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal	7
1	i needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving i do in traffic but i did n't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear i took a chance on this headset even though i read a review saying that it did n't sync up well with the vx8300 i could n't be more happy even though it is small \( about 1 1 2 \) the buttons are still large enough to use with ease it also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my vx8300	7
0	in the ad this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my treo it will charge but i already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose falsely calims to sync	7
0	i go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it when i got it in the mail i found that the c d they burned and sent with it would not work you had to have the product license number which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy i was never able to get it too work my advvice to you is not to buy this product but if you want to chance it you may be lucky i wasnt	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
0	samsung a670 is a lame phone also the battery life is not good it did n't have many features so its just a waste of your money the ringtone volume was too low i would suggest samsung improved this phone i am not sure if i ever want another samusung again i have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust	7
1	this product was a great deal these can be found other places for over 20 if you are like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you	7
1	this battery is as good as they say it is i have not ran out of power yet	7
1	works fine difficult to connect but connects securely comes with an unlabeled cd \( could n't tell one side from the other \) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones are n't labeled in any helpful way i was impressed it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy	7
1	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
1	overall i like it the best part is the flip up screen protector i have had 2 zire models and managed to break both screens my dislike is that i have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting i have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail as for the sd card issue i remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject to keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo i drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
0	this deal was too good to be true of course i was n't expecting any name brand stuff here but at least i expected them to all work i do n't know if i got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used the case i did n't need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed the power adapter seems to work fine so basically i spent 9 99 and am only using the power adapter i guess that 's a good enough deal i think i 'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud headset though	7
1	this is a great holster really cheap price i ordered a couple this time because it 's only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money it 's great	7
0	saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece so i took it the installation was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with an lg chocolate it was functional tested it out all over the house and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet used it driving and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels not a quality bluetooth earpiece look to motorola or jabra for a decent one	7
1	this battery performs as expected it is the standard palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device note also that when using bluetooth and or the blackberry rim email service battery life is notably reduced the solution would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment so my solution was to have a second spare battery	7
1	although the i607 \( blackjack \) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly the earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly	7
1	people keep asking me hey what kind of phone is that \? im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie hollar at ya boy	7
1	i was expecting just to save the touch screen from scratches but these screens make the touch screen also feel better there was no loss of brightness with the screen placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough its a pack of 15 screens have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all i 'll need to replace it	7
1	thought i 'd post this info here since this subject still confuses people i just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180 day period will invalidate 250 amazon phone rebate well i guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since i do n't really need a data plan and planned to use wifi connectivity most of the time any comments \? i still would like to give it 5 stars since i believe it is a great product i 'll take one star off however due for its weak battery life and lack of standard audio connection \( 2 5 or 3 5 minijack \)	7
0	the headset really has bad sound quality i missed the reviews before i ordered i should n't have bought it considering the quality of the headset i did n't even try the car charger in the fear that it would n't follow the necessary battery charge cycle	7
1	when i bought my motorola v220 my cingular store charged top dollar for the car charger and they were sold out i was thrilled when i found this starter set on amazon the car charger is compatible with the v220 and it comes with case and hands free ear bud all for less than i would have paid for the charger alone the ear bud does not have the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate i would n't buy this set specifically for those items although they both work with fit the v220 as i see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger five stars for the charger three for the rest	7
0	bought this because logitech has a great reputation with other products i used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and i never found the battery life to be long enough i actually went back to a jabra wired unit until recently when i purchased a samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better i guess i prefer the in ear style	7
0	these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped the software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time	7
0	do not order from this company the cable does not fit in the phone unfortunately i did not read the reviews before purchasing from eforcity the cable came a few days late when it arrived the cable did not even fit the software for the cable was defective after it had finished installing windows xp came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system eforcity is awful	7
0	the good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the treo 650 's interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that i wish i had never upgraded to the 680	7
0	does not work with verizon v3c when i plug the phone in it says unauthorized charger and refuses to charge at all it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars if i could i would give it zero stars i suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing maybe it works in china but not in north america	7
1	the cover design is well made based on the requirements the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case	7
0	motorola one is far better in quality as well to use	7
1	i owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart it was 30 at best buy i have n't replaced it as 30 is a lot 10 \? i'm buying two more i can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems it has far better sound quality than my 'backup' which is a jabra with no boom the ear volume is adjustable on my phone and i'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that wo n't let them adjust the volume	7
1	my v180 is through cingular i never have a dropped call and reception is excellent long battery life very easy menus wayfinding and small size no frills like mp3 player or camera however just a very good phone	7
0	this product really needs installation assistance too many options and i spent 2 hours trying to figure it out i'm going to call to get more info arrival time 5 starsprice 5 starsinstallation and ease 1 sta	7
0	this is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen i attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the cingular screen with a new lens cloth once specks of dust touch the adhesive they 're there for good and the protector is ruined i gave up because i was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than i was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid ! save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in	7
1	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
0	do n't waste your money after 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2 year service agreement i opted to purchase a new battery waste of money ! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re charge nightly that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery nightly re charge	7
1	very nice product the retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone my complaint with all palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break but the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2	7
0	the product was sent with a plastic bag no manual not anything only the base and tha ac charger wall when i tried it 's not working neither the cradle neither the aditional battery charger	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7

1	i bought my treo 750v a couple of days ago i got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery the only problem i am facing is with setting my voice mail the icon shown in the today page does not accept any number i will to attach to it as a result i was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number i really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by palm with a downloadable file because except for this problem treo 750 is really great	7
1	i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands ! ! anyone who are crazy over that color !	7
1	i just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice it feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special i like the blue led light instead of the typical red dot also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging the ic chip is important so that you do n't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it 's life i would buy again great price for a quality charger	7
1	i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i ca n't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and do n't fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them \( i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so do n't say you ca n't use all of the sizes guys	7
0	got it home put in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone once it was charged i went to activate the phone it said insert sim i redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understand my error when i got a person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to send me a new phone mind was broke so we will see if the new one is better next week when it comes	7
1	i just got my pink razr phone and i love it so far i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it still it works well i was scared to buy this phone because i read some of the reviews and some of them were n't saying good things about the phone but i think that they were wrong about it great job motorola keep up the good work	7
1	it worked great just like i excpected everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase	7
0	i have had this phone for about six months i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it 's hard to do anything the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it 's closed it 's almost impossible to hear i almost never hear it ring i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on ! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon	7
0	this product alone does none of the things listed in the descrption by itself you must still buy other software to use it when i questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it does n't do they pointed out where it says may require 3rd party software for various uses i just did n't know that the definition of 'various' was all uses we have listed i would rate my experience with this seller as dissapointingat least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere	7
0	the cover does n't fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom it also falls off from the clip today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car this is a poor quality product and i would n't recommend it to anyone	7
1	the treo600 has all the functions i needed phone calendar camera etc two shortcomings 1 \) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that 's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo6502 \) the phone failed to dial two times in two months i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem	7
1	you can pretty much do anything you would like with this product ! ! the only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in other then that you can manager anything you would like	7
1	i received exactly what i ordered very quickly	7
1	shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product is of great quality	7
0	a useless piece of junk worked for 3 minutes then broke have since bought a motorola brand one for three times what i paid for this piece of junk do not be attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for \( or what you dont pay for in this case \)	7
1	this headset is actually really comfortable i really do n't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly the sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well great product and great price	7
0	this cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting i do not recomend it it costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it i will chalk this up to you get what you pay for	7
0	we were excited to find such a good deal the clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse the home charger never worked the car charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package one thing my boyfriend and i learned through this experience is to pay for known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and time	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	i have had to exchange my pink verizon motorola razr 3 times ! ! ! ! ! ! luckily i purchased the insurance i'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr \( this last phone only lasted a few weeks ! \) this time i am asking for different phone the phone works fine then all of sudden one day 1 2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you ca n't get to anything no phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing ! ! ! ! it is extremely frustrating what is the point of a cute phone that does n't work	7
1	i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr v3m it fits very well and looks very nice	7
1	i purchased this headset \( \) and the key features i like are as follows 1 aaa battery no charging ! 2 easy to pair with my phone \( motorola slvr l7 european version \) 3 no static on both ends 4 have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated 5 price affordable but acts like an expensive headset 6 volume is good 7 fits well does not feel lose 8 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced i am very happy with it i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset	7
1	it worked well with my vx8300 however i already had a driver that i knew worked so i did not use the disc so i cannot comment on the driver disc	7
1	i got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what i would have paid for the car charger alone you ca n't beat this price	7
0	i ordered this phone on 3 28 07 it shipped via fedex on 3 29 07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3 2 07 the package sat on the fedex truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for this was after i 'd already called fedex to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving fedex 's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded for the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local cingular store	7
1	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7

1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7

0	amazon rebate is a scam i purchased this headset on 1 23 2007 and received it on 1 25 2007 however the rebateshq site was not functioning on 1 25 2007 when it works the next day it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture if you click on the url link supplied by amazon rebate form you will be able to find the offer by amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired' there is no way around what a scam it 's a shame for amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers it 's 5 99 come on	7

1	i 've had my treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications i especially love having the goodlink email application my family videos mp3 's pics and all my office documents at a touch of a finger yes the battery life goes quickly but i do n't mind charging my treo every night the slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand in the one month of usage my treo has hung one time a simple reset fixed it and has n't hung since	7
1	after reading the reviews here of this case i thought i 'd take the plunge and try it the cases i 'd seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper this is a wonderful case the materials are first rate and the fit is perfect i highly recommend this case	7
1	i ordered this usb cable for my samsung sync and it came fast while there is no software provided i quickly found out it syncs with windows media player so i could add music to my phone after searching i found that samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for free ! if you want to fully utilize your sync 's camera and mp3 capabilities i highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to samsung 's site for the free software	7
1	i really like this case ! it is easy to put on and take off it does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen it does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and i think it makes my phone easier to hold i would like for more colors i would really like for something to glow in the dark so that i could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse	7

0	it is a quick meal when you need it but hopefully you wo n't need it too often i guess you ca n't expect too much from a two minute meal but it would be nice if you could expect more than this it is an easy kosher meal when you do n't have a kosher microwave	8
1	bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast 's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat	8
1	forget the white tea at starbucks clipper is the real deal ! quick to make requires just 30 seconds to steep i do it with non dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar but this is pretty sweet by itself but bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here or get them for pretty much the same price at whole foods	8

1	these butter waffles are very tasty very light yet rich and buttery they 're hard to resist could n't help but eat a whole box only downside is that it uses vanillin rather than real vanilla however it goes great with ice cream and fruits	8
1	pretty good solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem i enjoyed them for hiking and biking i do n't recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things	8
0	bob 's red mill roasted oregon hazelnuts tasted stale and over cooked this is not a quality product and not good value for the money do n't waste your money on this item	8

1	very nice wooden tea box will make a nice present i have not tried the teas though	8
1	these are the best almonds i 've ever had though it is true that the amazon ad states they are all natural \( an error on their part not on emerald \) they are very close to it the pricing here is a bit high at our higher end market i pay 5 49 for an 11oz canister the pricing is better to buy at the store than through amazon overall but if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close \( about 7 8 higher \) i do highly recommend this brand	8
1	flavor is very good the reason i could n't rate it higher is that i have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in	8
1	this is the first gluten free product i found that my daughter likes perhaps likes is n't the right word she eats large helpings every time i serve it for a little variety i put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix this is the favorite in our household	8
1	wow this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label warning highly addictive hands down the best beef jerky we 've ever eaten moist yet chewy very satisfying not too salty lots of flavor think maybe i 'll go eat some now	8
1	i wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as i think the 4 5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves however i think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the internet especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option i would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality	8
1	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
1	i love eating a lot of cereal in the morning like anybody i really do n't choose a cereal that is just good for you i really choose it for taste i loved special k before when it was plain flakes but i absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries this cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries i like how delightful the strawberries taste after i add the milk into the cereal this is a great buy for anybody who loves special k cereal or for anyone who just has n't considered that special challenge price b taste a overal b	8

1	and mild just a hint of fruitiness the white tea is n't as bold as green but equally as or better for you	8
1	ever since i returned from spain i have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas these are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful if you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat i highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars	8

1	my family and i love almond crunch they 're just sweet enough very crunchy and a perfect snack	8
1	the number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive this cereal costs 7 00 bag at my local health food store one needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags but it 's worth it to buy from amazon com by the case	8
1	excellent coffee good value plus you are aiding the growers which is a big plus	8
0	this is a terrible tasting bar i have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst i 've ever tasted it leaves an after taste	8

1	these airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat i like this mandarin mint flavor the most but all are pretty good the small red bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors	8
0	although i love the nana 's brownie mint and peanut butter flavor cookies i found the ginger cookie disappointing it was too spicy to be enjoyable and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors \( the crumbliness is due to the gluten free rice flour \) also the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors i 've had 360 calories per cookie compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories note that nana 's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving but they count a serving size as half a cookie	8
1	i had been using sweetleaf before buying it at the local super market health food section buying here is around a 50 savings this product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste i just love that it is a natural product	8
1	i was never big on cereals until i tried this one now i'm hooked thisis a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries it 's great for anytime you have the munchies but do n't want to eat empty calories it 's also the best of all the cereals thatadd fruit	8

1	once i tried illy everything else tasted just ok truly an excellent coffee flavor smooth not bitter of overly strong and the price is lower than any store i 've check and even better than ordering directly from illy at a price of 13 per can i was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping i love that i only have to order two at a time and it 's delivered to my door !	8
1	there is one other cereal on the market that is very similar incrunchy tasteful cereal ! ! i had both in my pantry and tried each independently and then together this the one cereal that is good on any outing for breakfast with milk can of cream orjust plain water on a camping outing outfit your backpack withhealthy goodies no spoilage either i was hiking for four days with kashi dried fruit several cans of juices it is just the best approach for hiking with the minnimum lager on board	8
1	i really like this cereal by nature 's path it is very good and tasty however i just found a new favorite which is the zen version with cranberries and ginger i highly recommend both of them though the optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too	8
0	i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee most of the time i would just give up again the other brand of coffee i use never does this not getting this coffee anymore i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all donna marylan	8

0	this peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy skippy a lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by palm oil they meant to write socks thoroughly disappointing i only finished the one jar i bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and i was n't about to waste it buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains fully hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike partially hydrogenated ones	8
0	way too sweet for beef jerky it was similar to drinking a soda	8
1	lady grey is practically the only tea my family and i drink first we bought it because of cornflowers which are kinda symbol of russia where i was born but we stayed with it for the taste try it cold with lemon it 's amazing	8
0	i love blueberries both fresh and dried but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste dried fruit is always naturally sweet added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy instead of a naturally healthy snack thumbs down for this one	8
1	this coffee is awesome ! the aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me ! the price is great and the shipping is quick i am really glad to see that it is organic as well this sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust	8

1	i have sensitive to sugar teeth and these are beautiful and healthy most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value no thanks these are good for you and taste rather good too they are a bit bland but i like the texture with what 's in them and how they 're held together they 're a bit like rice krispy treats but taste healthy yum i love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine	8
1	i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee give it a try ! i will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs 18 in the regular bags	8
1	bear naked granola is just fabulous i 've tried every granola around and bear naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you and amazon 's price certainly beats what you 'd pay at the store	8
1	no complaints on this one at all very mild and easy to drink	8
1	economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring easy to make and tastes great no guilt with this drink	8
1	nice clean meyer lemon flavor these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon chefs love using these lemons in recipes this flavor also makes a great lemon drop	8
0	like the idea of getting some samples but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles do not buy	8
0	reminds me of the fruit bars from my childhood that first came out around the time fruit roll ups did they seem to have some kind of strong odor to them but if you can get past that they do n't taste so bad	8
1	i have tried all four fox river rice flavors and this is my favorite while cooking the rice the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen ! this flavor also has a little bite from the pepper i have served it with chicken and steak ! great product	8
1	i love twinings but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time there needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product	8
1	for a working mom these are the best quick easy heck my four year old can make them ! price wise \? i'm a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for 1 a bag amazon offers them for less the garlic cheddar biscuits btw are the closest things i 've found to the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits and so easy	8
0	is n't very tasty falls apart when taking a bite not recommended	8
1	i ordered both the brown sugar jerky and the peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic this jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew the flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat i am on my second 2lb order i am totally hooked	8
1	i like the nutiva hemp protein a great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber ca n't beat that ! it wo n't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can i like the taste and texture too mixes great with cranberry juice cranberries stevia ice and water ! i add some berry green for extra energy and nutrients ! it 's my morning breakfast	8
1	i love this cereal i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time i also snack on it dry it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk	8
0	i 've only been on a gluten free diet for four months so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid the worst part is that amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this i 'd put it out for the squirrels but i'm not sure they 'd eat it if you 're expecting something that tastes anything like bread you 're in for a shock	8
1	i 've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and have n't made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it 's marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki \( perfect \) a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism	8
1	this is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor my dad 's a long time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile so he 's getting a four pack for christmas ! great texture great flavor great price	8
0	i love most jack links jerky products however i was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste it tasted like a bunch of powdered old hot spices not a true fresh pepper cure i think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste i have not given up on jack links just ordered their turkey jerky	8
1	i bought some nana 's no refined sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale they were so incredible i looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here these cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well really all of the flavors i tried \( choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin \) were outstanding	8
1	my was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers when she had to go gluten free we searched for some adequate substitute while they are not cheddar goldfish crackers they are very tasty and satisfying	8
0	i have been buying stoneridge orchards products for a long time so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages but also the pouches were half open in the box what a rip of	8
1	i use these beans in a jura capresso superautomatic everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try also has excellent crema	8
1	i recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods staying away from hydrogenated oils corn syrup etc you know all the stuff that makes you fat \) this jerky is a great healthy lowfat snack ! ! it tastes so amazing you 'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again i love jerky and have tried many different brands this jerky is well worth every penny and i 'll keep coming back for more thanks amazon for making it affordable	8
0	i di n't love these at all the flavor combinations struck me as off there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa also the texture was unpleasant somewhat soggy i like the healthy aspect but if you are n't enjoying the experience why eat at all	8
0	these dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit i was expecting a chewy tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead i will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal but i wo n't buy them again	8
0	i was very disappointed in this product i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out 20 i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not	8
1	if you like hempseeds like i do this is your best buy amazon has the best price the seeds came fast fresh and are terrific to me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages the 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed i took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer i have a big bag in the refrigerator i toss these seeds all over my salads	8
1	i love these cookies too ! they 're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that does n't feel waxy in your mouth the lemon taste is great and they 're not too sweet they 're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but do n't want to overdo it with calories or sugar the box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it	8
0	not only is the popcorn incredibly salty but they do not taste very crispy quite stale overall disappointing i sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them so it is not that i kept them too long too bad they are too far to return overall a disappointing experience	8
0	i 've tried this twice now and both times it had an off taste a bit rancid like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature i 'd guess that amazon 's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out	8
1	my fav out of all nature 's path cereals and trust me i know nature 's path cereals calorie count perfect nutrition perfect everything is great about this	8
1	i personally like the taste of this product but i can see that others may not the taste is unusual with natural tones i definitely like the packaging standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time but a box of zico survived a 2 week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine	8
1	i liked this so much i gave some as gifts to friends \( before i polished it all off \) i am better able to stick with reasonable and healthy portions at my evening meal if i can look forward to a little treat later in the evening i serve it in a small cup that will hold a third of a box satisfying and healthy what a deal	8
1	my 2 1 2 year old son cannot have gluten items and these muffins are very adaptable and tasty i add fresh apples bananas or carrots with crushed pineapple plus some cinnamon or nutmeg and he loves these muffins ! they are a bit plain without the additions though	8
1	these nuts are excellent just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit	8
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	8
1	we love this cereal it is nice and crunchy and it does n't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes i definately will buy this again	8
1	this is the best home style sushi kit you get the basics excellent rice sushi wrap sheets soy sauce i made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon in the rolls as i assembled them the best ! ! ! ! the possibilities are endless ! ! ! ! try it you 'll see sometime i can be all thumbs but this was very easy the quality of the food was excellent	8
1	i thought tuna in olive oil tasted good but this is better this is the tuna for salad nicoise maybe use the other for mixing tuna salad	8
1	these were very good cookies i loved the texture and flavor a nice surprise from a packaged cookie i would buy again	8
1	great for novelty gifts but do n't give it to true tea lovers ! ! ! different kinds of flowering tea look great very entertaining to watch bloom but taste pretty crummy i would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless nevertheless it 's a nice gift because of the experience and the cool box glass pot you get to keep	8
0	i did n't like this at all i found it chemical and not nicely redolent of the ginger i o so love i just gave it away cute little tin and all i am adventurous so i do happen on things i feel are n't what i expected from time to time this was certainly one of them i'm sure some of you will like like it do n't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds mine said this tea is not a real peach either	8
1	i find it easy to use at breakfast when added to my muesli honey and yogurt mix powerful healthy morning treat for the price you ca n't beat it as a health food	8
1	i love these crackers for several reasons they are absoutely delicious to begin with and they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil they are hard to find in stores it 's a hit or miss thing here in the northeast so i ordered from amazon propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back	8
1	even though i know it 's important to eat breakfast i seldom do it i 'd rather sleep a little longer these breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem i keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning they 're whole grain nice and filling and taste good to boot they 're also a nice treat on the way home the oats and honey are my favorite but the variety pack provides a nice change all of the flavors are tasty peanut butter cinnamon maple sugar all yummy	8
1	am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet the pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good even dh with incredible sweet tooth liked it	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
1	did n't expect much with the price being this low but it 's now a family favorite ca n't tell the difference between this and jeremiah 's kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes it 's one of our family favorites now	8
1	what a deal ! great tasting treat at a good price ! i will definetly be ordering other flavors and killarney again too	8
1	i use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats yum	8
0	when you can buy a 40 oz jar at the local grocery store for 4 59	8
1	great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag california does some things better than us here in indiana coffee is one of them	8
1	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
1	this peanut butter was wonderful ! ! smooth and creamy just like they said ! good price too	8
0	perhaps it was just my microwave or cooking it too long but the two different types of this soup i have tried \( chicken with noodles and chicken with rice \) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of i would have thrown it out except it was the only thing i brought for lunch i do not recommend this soup	8
1	everyone in my family \( from 3 to 64 years old \) loves these organic cookies i purchased these cookies at several local stores before i discovered that amazon had them i sent a package to my grandson who is in the army in iraq and he raved about them newman 's has another big winner !	8
1	we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes i like how easy they are to use no mess no tamping i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily	8
1	this coffee is amazing we stayed at the shore club in miami beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at ago restaurant hooked ever since this is the only coffee i ever drink now starbucks caribou are nothing compared to this one sip or sniff of the aroma will get you hooked forever if you ever make it out to south beach illy has a store on ocean drive	8
1	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
0	received shipment early january of 2007 to find out the expiration date was in 2006 buyer bewar	8
1	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
0	i absolutely agree with the two other reviewers i had very high hopes too as i use mccann 's brown bread mix all the time i do n't think i could live without it so i was very disappointed with the fruit scones mix there is a very weird taste to me it seems like 'soapy' or something but definitely not a pleasure to eat i 've got tons of bags left of this mix which i will have to throw away i would definitely not recommend this product sorry	8
1	they were thick like bisquick biscuits they tasted great would be wonderful in chicken dumplings the only thing i did wrong when making them was using bob 's red mill sall purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in it made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans yuck ! i used white rice flour and they tasted great \) for a buttery flavor put butter \( or if you are gfcf a non casien containing margarine spread \) on the top for a taste similar to kfc taste great with jelly in the middle too \) i froze the unbaked left over biscuits and they turned out well 2 months later	8
0	this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti	8
0	sorry guys i do n't know if i was n't tasting real miso soup at my local restaurant but the thing is i did n't like this one bit and i still have lots of packages left ! haha i gave it a chance because i love the soup from the japanese restaurant i visited and i wanted to taste this soup whenever i wanted at home but i did n't like the flavor do n't know if i'm missing something but better buy one \( one \) a see for yourself	8
0	granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco 's granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that 's better	8
1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	i am crazy about splenda i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael it saves money and calories asparteem \( nutrasweet \) gives me loose bowels splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories	8
1	my family really enjoyed this rice pudding i loved the real cinammon stick it gave the rice a rich flavor the aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat best of all is how simple it was boil the water empty package wait 20 minutes enjoy !	8

1	faster than expected shipping ! great tasting product and good for you too	8
0	peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture after trying one package it was so bad that i had to throw out the rest of the case a waste of money	8
0	i thought these would be slightly sour like dried cherries i have enjoyed in the past no hfcs is high fructose corn syrup so these taste strangely sweet like weird raisins they are ok if i cook them in oatmeal or if i'm really hungry but i would n't buy them again if you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere	8
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
1	bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries they make a huge difference and are worth the extra price i substitute them for the raisins in our favorite quaker oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter sugar calories !	8
1	i am ordering more of these goodies they are not only delicious and top quality they are the most interesting assortment i have ever had and are great for my sensitive stomach too ! very excellent price as well !	8
1	just the right size snack pack for my 17 month old healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste	8
0	i tried it also as a less expensive alternative and wo n't be ordering again the flavor just tasted off to me kinda like old coffee that 's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours did n't have that freshly brewed taste	8
1	i will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo	8
1	these things are great i love baker 's breakfast cookies this flavor is pretty darn good too big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor does n't taste fake at all i prefer a couple other flavors more but this is definately a winner these cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you they will fill you up for hours especially with a glass of water juice or milk to wash it down	8
1	these are sweet and lightly chewy with a touch of lemon it 's been a long time ago since i could get three organic healthy snack bars for a buck	8
1	hazelnuts are tasty a 4 pack is twice as many as you 'd expect as part of a single package	8
1	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	8
1	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
1	you ca n't tell this is rice nooles it tast just like regular pasta ! ! my celiac husband loves it and he doens't feel like his missng out	8
1	adding another italian classic to our product line puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which to put it modestly translates into a lot of things going on at the same time the rich combination of flavors garlic black olives capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking recipe suggestions use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken fish or your relationship just heat and serve or bake it in try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative ! the favorite \? grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on	8
1	these cookies are great my kids love them i saved a bundle by ordering the case beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06 i did n't have any problems with the classic the expiration date was nov or dec i ca n't remember off hand	8
1	a delicious nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack very vegan and very good	8
1	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
0	it 's not terrible but it 's not very good for the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better i sent 8 of the 9 packets back	8
0	this is the best coffee i 've ever had very smooth with rich flavor	8
0	i'm sorry but what on god 's green earth are these people talking about when they say the highest quality wholesome ingredients \? \? \? the first ingredient listed is corn syrup followed closely by sugar god i'm livid corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a major culprit in the obesity epidemic spare yourself eat a damn piece of fruit many thanks the food zealo	8
1	i love velveeta and i love the rotini and cheese i have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores i shop at i found it not to be as good as i remembered the broccoli was minimal at best	8
1	high quality refined balance and intriguing flavor two thumbs up form people who like to cook	8
0	this stuff tastes absolutely terrible ! steer clear and do n't be mislead by the texture review below yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately is n't worth it	8
0	i tossed it out the texture is aweful and brittle only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible gross ! you get what you pay for	8
1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	8
1	just tried this granola today it 's really good ! the packaging is also great just like a milk carton no broken bags or messes to deal with and really easy to pour this granola has the perfect blend of grains and just the right amount of raisins	8
1	i started to love annie chun 's udon soup in march 2007 although it was on my amazon grocery list for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great i just ordered many a chun 's soup noodle bowls and i will order more again in future annie chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on amazon com	8
1	these brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor and i can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils preservatives unnatural colors or flavors because there are n't any ! so far i have made two batches neither batch came out perfectly chewy the first batch came out a little hard but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st and i think i'm getting the hang of it this is better than anything else i 've tried i had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives so this is a great treat	8
1	other than the republic of tea the people 's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract \( protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation \) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one 's daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day !	8
1	ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews i am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product i will buy again my kids love the stuff not a bad snack	8
0	sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more i havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time you cannot return these or any food items to amazon the coconut was moist and tender yet no good flavor taste smells of cheap food grade oil the spirulina is too try and chalky too much dried spirulina in one bar again bad taste no good alive flavor spirulina and cashew coconut agave nectar elisha elishachristian earthlink ne	8

0	this type of mac cheese pasta does n't produce as much as the elbow mac cheese other than that it tastes the same good stuff	8
1	i was eager to try the sugar blend for baking i noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact the usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package the flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life	8
0	but i may never know i ordered this item on october 27 when a shipment finally arrived there was only one container of this inside ! i ordered a four pack i'm sure so amazon offered to try again sending the item but it 's now november 30th the item has been in stock the whole time so i'm not sure what has caused the delay i'm just thankful i ordered it just to try it out and that i did n't actually need it by any certain date	8
1	i so love this jerky it is moist but not too moist and has great flavor we have tried several of their flavors and they are all awesome great prices for hormone free stuff and no preservatives jerky tastes so much better and richer without msg in it	8
1	get your children to eat a little bit of fiber ! ! these are really good of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better !	8
0	i ordered these and received less than 300 some of the packages had holes in them and melted bags i contacted the supplier and they did nothing to resolve the issue i would not order from them again	8
1	this fills me up and it tastes very good i only with the box was bigger i can only get 2 bowls per box	8
1	this is a great crystal light product i like that you get vitamin c from it it is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories tastes good too	8
1	good low sodium low sugar granola that i feel i ca n't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues	8
1	this jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten i buy it every year as christmas gifts \( and ofcourse save one pkg for us \) and everyone raves about it my family always looks forward to christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays you ca n't beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful the brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness i would highly recommend this product value and quality ca n't be beat a thanks !	8
1	outstanding full flavored earl grey tea better than the other non branded earl grey teas	8
1	we first bought these crackers in a local store and loved them nutritionwise they are really good and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy never attempt a conversation while partaking you 'll never hear the other person \) after our first purchase we bought directly from dr kracker then they told us of the great deal we 'd get buying them thru amazon and that 's what we 've been doing ever since aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter then we 'll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time	8
1	it is hard to believe all you do is add water and then enjoy the best mustard	8
1	of the several brands of agave nectar that i have tried this one is by far the best it has the least taste to it it is just sweet \( very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water \)	8
0	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	silly me ! i assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews but the only ingredient you can taste in them or any of their other flavors is dates if you really love dates go for it otherwise forget it	8
1	i have a briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot i have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema enjoy	8

0	i could not believe how disgusting this product was i do not think it should be given a star at all i most certainly will not buy any of these products again \( i also bought the coconut balls \) this was such a waste of my money	8
1	after all the great reviews we did n't think we could go wrong these are really good but not as satisfying as maybe a protein bar then again did n't really expect them to be	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	these are very good biscotti ! i've ordered 4 boxes of 12 in the past few months they were nice to give as gifts they were good to bring to someones house for dessert the chocolate decadence and the ones with the toffee bits and almonds are very good the only negative is the shipping and handling cost if i did not get the free shipping and handling i would not have ordered them they're good but not good enough to spend an extra 20 to deliver	8
1	i love this coffee it has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning i do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee but rather what i would call trucker or cowboy coffee if you like strong coffee buy it if you like delicate coffee buy something else	8
1	my husband 's favorite jerky used to buy single bag \( much higher price \) for special treat for him just wish he would not go through eight bags so quickly	8
1	smooth flavorful coffee i would n't mind a little stronger flavor but it 's very good huge bag	8
0	okay yes i know the brand is dr kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product however i have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita these are very crunchy and do n't have a whole lot of flavor additionally they were shipped and arrived expired if you are shopping for a super healthy cracker this may be it if you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita keep shopping this is not it my next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia	8
1	i thought this was great but it just was n't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon so delicious though when i make it for people they ca n't believe it 's a mix	8
1	this is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick it will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine true it has a lot of solium but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals the seaweed veriety is the best open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away for others it may take some time to get used to do try your body will thank you	8
1	these bars are terrific very moist unlike many other snack bars they are quite tastey and my kids really like them too	8
1	i received the correct item in a timely manner and it was organic my kids love them \( as do i \) i love finding healthy snacks that do n't have any additives or junk in them	8
0	i got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas this is undrinkable in fact it 's unsmellable i opened the tin and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural smelled and tasted like handcream yes i actually tasted it furthermore the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy the quality you 'd find in a no name tea from the dollar store the tab simply said ceylon tea it looks like bentley got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin i gave it one star for the tin if you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea do n't buy this one	8
0	it 's easier to make one from scratch and you electricity bill wo n't skyrocket	8
1	this granola is great tasting and healthy other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not apple blueberry is my family 's favorite flavor	8
1	excellent cookies my boys love them know they are a treat that is on the healthy side we will buy these again	8
0	slim jims may taste ok but that 's because they are so greasy that 's what helps the flavor i ca n't figure out why anyone would like these as i ca n't seem to chew them to a point where i feel comfortable to swallow it 's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat the amount of fat cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky i 'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff at least i can chew the beef jerky	8
1	by far the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny	8
1	this is the same crystal light lemonade that comes in the round containersbut with the quanity buy much cheaper great taste	8
1	this is just what i 've been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general the flavor of the meat is not masked by salt yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands great stuff ! four stars only because it is 3 75 per can	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	i am the newest member of the lose informal office oatmeal club i have introduced this hot cereal to many a members who are all hooked those who love oatmeal are and hooked and those who had to eat oatmeal as a kid and now hate it love it it tastes great has great farro or barley like texture and it smells heavenly and gets the appetite going	8
1	the crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared as well as the low calorie sweetened teas if you like it a bit sweeter put an extra pack of splenda in it	8
0	this is the second batch i ordered i have had to contact representatives at brucepac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky i have enjoyed the same world kitchen jerky from other vendors so i cannot understand why the order from amazon has been such a disappointment	8
1	the variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee i 've had in a long time i drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one i look forward to the most is the cup i make in the morning on my senseo machine the origins pods are the best of the best these pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available get the variety pack and try them all they are all wonderful	8
1	these are the best ! they remind me of rice crispy treats they 're so chewy and delicious i recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products	8
1	green is good of course but what 's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation crunchier more filling \( without being smarmy \) much better taste \( and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate \) fast eddie felson i love you	8

1	i 've tried almost every green tea on the market and this is one of my favorites it has a great flavor and it really does help me keep from snacking between meals i do n't think it 's possible to find great organic green tea at this price anywhere else	8
0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8
0	i was disappointed with this product i love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste they have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell they are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer you should also know that this food product cannot be returned i would have sent it back in a flash if i could have	8

0	i tried really hard to like this stuff you know organic and all that the elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy pasty and tastes like cheez whiz if you like cheez whiz you will love this mac cheez if not pass it by i 'd have given it to mikey but he does n't live at our house anymore my recommendation is to make your own from scratch it 's not that difficult and it 's so much better	8
1	some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread it substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading \( it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long we knead bread about three minutes \) spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes it seems easier to digest it does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten sensitive this is probably not an alternative	8
1	i 've been a big fan of ener g foods alternative food products ever since i discovered that i was wheat and gluten allergic these have been my only substitutes for breads these muffins are very tasty and crispy when toasted and are instant favorites of mine also check out ener g 's light brown rice bread for sandwiches and their cookie assortment these are so good that i do n't even miss regular wheat breads and cookies	8
1	these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself i was very pleased with this purchase	8

0	ordered a melitta 10 cup coffee maker and on the same page was an ad for the melitta filters they were very expensive and when they arrived they were not for a 10 cup melitta i advised the company but my complaint went to dead ears ! buy your filters at the local store they are cheaper	8
1	we love cinna raisin crunch for breakfast the clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk the cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours if you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you	8
1	if you like strong coffess go with this its wonderful ! definitely worth it	8
1	these instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make a nice buttery flavor and all you need is water will be buying more	8
1	i am so glad i found these my son \( 22 months old \) is crazy about these apples and i ca n't find them at the store any more they have a really great flavor and texture they are very different than traditional dried fruit the apples are plump and actually look like they came from an apple	8

1	agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufacturedsweeteners on the market today my only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use thanks e	8
0	two of the six packages were beginning to mold but not even close to the expiration date one other package was visibly torn i was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air tight so i placed them in water five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal i imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude pressure i cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as i did not eat them the silver lining amazon has great customer service	8
1	full bodied and flavorful make the medium cup for a smooth and mellow cup of java if you make the tall it will be alittle weak	8
1	planters cashews in milk chocolate are so so delicous ! i am absolutely addicted ! they are so good a great snack or dessert and they even come in different sizes one size for home and one smaller size for on the go ! i could not ask for tastier chocolate or more wonderful tasting cashews ! try 'em amazoners you will love them ! thank you	8
1	very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack my kids really like them and while they are n't low calorie or really low fat it is n't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat the 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	8
1	these are our new favorite breakfast food fantastic ! ! ! ! we love them and that 's even after we 're on our second set of 12 boxes the strawberry flavoring tastes real not fake like regular pop tarts overall the taste is sweet but not overly so this flavor is better than the apple cinnamon which we have also tried definitely one of our best amazon purchases ever	8
1	was visiting my daughter and found these wonderful habit forming crunchy with a hint of sweet crackers i do n't want to eat anything else now ! hope i can get them where i live in ny soon	8

1	i was really impressed by the taste of this cereal i was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this but instead it was really good it was sweet \( but not sugar sweet \) and crunchy i 'll definitely buy this again if the price went down i 'd buy it more	8
0	i bought these simply because i wanted an easy snack and the reviews were pretty good i took two bites and stopped the second bite was because i really could n't believe that i disliked something that much the odor is pretty bad too these smell very medicinal almost like a commercial disenfectant next time you 're at a doctor 's office try licking the counter it 's like that not that i 've ever done that but i ca n't describe it any other way please try one of these locally if you can i would n't suggest buying them if you ca n't	8
1	i have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and i still look forward to eating it it has an interesting flavor that i know i will never get tired of i highly recommend trying it	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
1	i am a coffee afficionado ! i'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans i can find i keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee ! this coffee was great and i have tried a million different brands ! ! ! organic and fair trade is important to me ! ! ! thanks for the extra effort ! i wish the big guys would make this kind of effort ! ! !	8
1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	8
1	we love this product in our house and it has helped me \( mom \) kick the diet soda habit i add my soluble fiber and other powdered supplements and i am on my way ! very true lemonade taste with no aftertaste at all	8
0	i read in a review that if you are on a blood thinner that this tea is not good for you what does it do that makes it unhealthy \? thin the blood more \? it did n't seem to affect my protime but i'm concerned	8
1	rather mild but pleasant tasting coffee typically consistent brewing	8

0	i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie 's products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware	8
1	these are wonderful cookies ! however the reason i could n't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies the boxes were not damaged in any way so i am guessing they could have been packaged that way not cool ! otherwise they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion i 'll never go back to those	8
1	i am addicted to these they are delicious not dry at all and there are lots of crackers in each container yum !	8
1	to get you through to your next meal my children and i love this flavor and it really tastes like peanut butter	8

1	these only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in not dry they taste great and i dont feel like i just ate fast food when i finish one of them or two	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
0	the newly re packaged twinings earl grey tea \( has the word classics on the package \) is much much weaker than the previous twinings earl grey tea if you used and like to the old teas then you wo n't like the new version i wonder if they have weakened the britsh version of twinings earl grey tea	8
1	i am a devoted earl grey tea drinker and have enjoyed earl grey tea all over the world ahmad tea has been my favorite for years i'm so pleased to be able to obtain it through amazon i used to have to carry it by the suitcaseful back from london to stock up	8

1	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	i have purchased this item several times it is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken it comes packaged well and is easy to prepare it is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
1	wonderfully totally delicious you don't want to finish the last kernal it's just so popp'n good	8
1	i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it 's great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it 's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up	8

1	best damn earl grey on the market the bergamot is well balanced with the black tea flavor still good even if the bag is left in for 'too' long buy this tea	8
1	if you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you they are higher in fat than i would like them to be but they are delicious great for a quick breakfast or snack there are 2 bars in each packett and i usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack	8
1	first found this concentrate a few years ago in kroger and took it camping because of its small size small size big on flavor and not too salty was glad to find it online as i ca n't get it in stores nearby anymore	8
1	you have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you it is very good for the body i tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause good stuff	8
1	this makes a great cake or cupcakes i used a modification to make it a chocolate cake it was a hit and also baked them in little bear molds the kids loved them i have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house no one non celiac can tell the difference	8

1	i buy this at sam 's club for about 12 2 before i became enlightened re organic products i was a folgers user this coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level but is flavorful for the price this is an incredible deal	8
1	from where i should start ! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients do you know \? try it and tell me your opinion	8
1	these are really great they are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal a great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season	8
1	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
1	i love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal absolutely delicious	8
1	i love splenda and i love getting it in a big bag as a good ole oklahoma girl i live for my iced tea and my tea must be sweet but sugar is n't an option so splenda to the rescue we use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my daddy has developed diabetes the big bags are often out at our local grocery store so finding them at amazon with our amazon prime takes care of that problem	8

1	i have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try i am so glad i did this is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks	8
1	these are very tasty not too sweet like some bars but plenty sweet enough nice fruity flavor my favorite of the three envirokidz bars even if i did n't need to eat gluten free these would be a favorite snack	8
0	i was disappointed with this powder i thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract but it does n't when used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed i wo n't buy it again i prefer using vanilla extract	8
1	if you care about the sugar that your kids are getting and you want a great tasting lolly these are great ! ! ! wow	8
0	i ordered teriyaki original and black pepper flavored ones the other two flovors are quite good but this one teriyaki is really sub standard it has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others	8
0	scant vegetables and beef surprisingly little barley gloppy texture much too salty does not taste fresh needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible hard to believe but campbell 's is better	8
1	i 've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie to get height i whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks they 've turned out great and you ca n't tell it 's gluten free i 've had less luck making biscuits out of it came out hard but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten free flour mix	8
0	silly me ! i assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews but the only ingredient you can taste in them or any of their other flavors is dates if you really love dates go for it otherwise forget it	8
1	i had read other 's reviews about how great this coffee was but i was using another coffee that i thought was really wonderful i tried this one and now i am hooked it is wonderful if you like bold coffee which i do i also like the fact that it is organic i do n't drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two i have i want to be great just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	8
0	just be sure to read up on this closely it 's not the orchestra you hear in the movie and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts gone are great talents enya and annie lennox replaced by no name voices this is not bad music but do n't think you 're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2 cd set	9
0	jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you but he missed the mark with me big time	9
0	i had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50 's and 60 's jazz legends before they became household names it was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again i heard brief notes from this cd and i must agree that mr winston did attempt to capturemr guaraldi 's timeless expressions but the this production did not have the same golden flow as the original	9
0	i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody \( name changed due to copyright issues \) on their 2006 live album live in canada i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however	9
1	this is where afi began their sound change from their first 2 cd 's \( answer that stay fashionable very proud of ya \) it is much more serious than the first 2 alot angrier heavier darker and more screaming yelling as well some people say this is their best i disagree i prefer their punkier 1st 2 but i still enjoy this alot it 's all down to personal taste it gets a 5 5 for me	9
0	do not buy this cd the first two reviews said this is a good cd nope i 'll tell ya the real about this cd i believe this was 305 's first cd and i do n't see how this cd was ever in mass production while it does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist 305 got much of the material for this cd on techmaster p e b 's masterpiece bass computer any one who has both cd 's can tell if your looking for bass you 'll find it here but you can find knock with any bass artist i give this cd one star for biting techmaster	9
1	dj quik \( the best producer ever \) did all the tracks in this one with help from robert bacon on some tracks this album is just classic nuthin more to it !	9
0	i guess i was expecting more of a ferrante and teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time could be that it is but if so am missing depth great family but disappointing albu	9
0	do not buy this cd he is definitely wack his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats as a member of children of the corn he was weak and he still is weak the other member of his dip set crew outshine him on his own cd how lame is that through away any cam'ron cd 's you own and immediately replace them with music by jay z	9
1	ok good cd im not suprised ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings i like that daddy thing song and like a dj this album looks at issues from a mans point of view ya know we 've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well also this is a break from that that is played on the radio	9
0	generally harmless except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents the song is probably funny to ultra sophisticated cynical adults but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old i would n't bring this cd into your house	9
0	i ca n't discard these songs completely because they have such potential ! clever fun lyrics great beat but boy i wish this guy could hit his notes more often ! i suppose this fellow requires the sort of pitch does n't matter mindset that grateful dead listeners perfected years ago \( or similar drugs \) i'm just not that tolerant or substance affected	9
1	the more i listen to this album the more i love it what 's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package this is one cooooool cd	9
0	this industry is goin down u call this an album \? \? \? lo	9
1	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time surprisingly evans' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings highlights are the amazing quot waltz for debby quot and earl zindars' waltz quot elsa quot easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written in my opinion you simply cannot go wrong with this cd	9
1	juice newton is one of the best counry pop singers of all times a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartacheafter all these years her work is unforgettable catchy and full of energy and vibe	9
1	just wonderful wonderful ! even if you have n't seen the movie buy the music so lovely and refreshing of course there is no one like van morrison \( always and forever a 5 star \) he tops the all time charts for me kevin kline is so smooth with la mer and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting you just ca n't miss with this one	9
1	this is the only albulm i have of the exiesfor christmas i am getting the last albulm if its the same as this one the exies must be good this is the best albulm i have listened to my favourites are ugly babtise me splinter and dear enemymy least favourites are none i like every songits an amazing albulm ihave listened to some of the tracks over and over again and everytime i think wowthis band should be more popularfrom craig from the uk	9
1	the rosary is very well produced a powerful tool to crush the devils head	9
0	i remember listening to this years ago and i thought i would add this to my cd library now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it very sqeaky dull slow paced stuff bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil	9
1	bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz he is also one of the most creative on this album he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning move has a smaller more focused sound that it 's predecessors and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion bravo !	9
1	it is good for old eric gale fans to be able to purchase thiscd it will bring back many memories it will also remind youof how great a guitar player he was i am grateful that i 'vehad a chance to own many recordings that he has played on payclose attention to she is my lady and morning glory this is amust have cd jaye pricebeltsville md	9
1	well this is n't at the gates nightrage reminds me of many old arch enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic of course that leads into gus g substituting chris on concerts being an excellent choice as they make very similar melodies some people say this album is heavy which it is in some parts but its melodic death there are no signs of thrash or anything just great melodies great headbanging music add this to your collection i think its better than sweet vengeance	9
0	i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70 's and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style i still loved her vocal perfection this is truly the only album i have n't played more than twice \( i did n't like it the first time which surprised me so i tried it again \) it does n't showcase her voice or her talents the songs are very ho hum linda put out a christmas album \( been waiting for years \) and try to get sweetness back for this old fan	9
1	hell rell did his job i was n't expecting anything as good as this hell rell outdid himself	9
1	i 've been waiting for this one this disc and this group period was funky movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period can you see the light is a tight jam as well one of the many bad groups from back in the day	9
0	this album is all about sex and infidelity is this all way usher 's life is about this album contains to substance worth listening to this album is a total waste of money i like 8701 100 percent better	9
0	i ca n't say i liked this cd jessica simpson was good when she started but as her popularity has grown her talents have declined she commited murder the day she recorded senatra 's song for the dukes of hazard movie	9
0	yeah i am a big fan of moby and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise but fail to build up to anything everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style which were almost humorous except not this much money humorous i am not a fan of this cd i know he was starting out in a punk band but his other stuff is much bette	9
1	loreena has a pure talent for weaving melody music and words together her song the highwayman is absolutely astounding to be able to put the old poem into music melody and verse is quite amazing	9
0	for fans i suppose this would be a rather big delight for non fans it 's nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey they had some okay cheesy hits in the '80s but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays	9
0	one good song of course the sound of silence and the studio version is far better than this one i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect	9
1	you can resume eddie cochran very well with one cd after all when he died he was only 21 years old this selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the legendary master series released in 1990 his best songs are there summertime blues was of course a favorite of the who who often featured it in their concerts i am particularly fond of jeannie jeannie jeannie c'mon everybody and the marvellous somethin'else with it 's great shuffle a trademark of eddie if you are interested in rock 's early days you 'll enjoy this cd	9
0	this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work frankly it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators some of the craig chaquico style stuff was interesting but better left to craig try 7th heaven mosaico or guitar odyssey instead	9
1	the title says it all im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time	9
1	her voice takes my breath away i fell in love with her i highly reccomend it	9
0	amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms' music with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius' the choice of music is also quite perfunctory there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose buy at your own risk my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd	9
1	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's swanee and rock a bye although every track is just excellent the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby	9
1	every listen i get more into this cd many catchy songs i now need to buy more of donald 's solo stuff great music	9
0	this disc was simply a waste of my time very mediocre songs heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent corey 's voice is below average i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career and not doing it very well clearly 'fake it till you make it' is n't working here the songs all sound the same i kept waiting for something to get me grooving but it just did n't happen i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential he either needs voice lessons a little humility and some professional grooming \( and i do n't mean clothing \)	9
0	i like meav 's voice and this cd is ok if you like this kind of stuff think slow and somewhat depressing i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times and came up with this vocal sound i guess to hark back to earlier times which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music this is all a bit samey and dull i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though	9
0	great cd imus in the morning recommended highly and the i man was not wrong one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years i listen to a lot of buffett james taylor delbert mcclinton and this cd places high in these ranks	9
1	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album i sure do	9
1	this will be short it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr duet carolina shout that being said all of the other tracks on this album are excellent from jungle blues to doug wamble 's solo guitar on autumn lamp with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden 's art a must have branford keeps outdoing himself	9
1	jon brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie if you liked this movie by all means buy the soundtrack you will not be dissapointed eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie it makes me feel just good also be sure to pick up his solo record meaningless if you liked the movie buy this cd you wont regret it	9
0	well the labels did it again first when they released the album dream on cd their biggest hit from that album you never done it like that turned out to be a re recorded version on the cd release they did it again with this ultimate collection that being said i love some of their other hits especially the way that i want to touch you luckily the rest of the tracks are the originals if you 're looking for the original version of you never done it like that you would have to get the 20th century masters collection of theirs	9
1	hands down a 5 star two thumbs up classic joint after it dropped puba reigned supreeeme disregard the amazon reviewer there are no gaffes in this one period these guys were true to their beliefs they were n't packaging a product for pop consumption they were telling a generation what they thought check it out and the music will speak for itself the best track in my opinion was wake up but the whole album was great as someone else mentioned fast tracks put it in the 90 's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever	9
0	sorry guys i think that the cover says it all totally out of focus and falling apart i much prefer his later work	9
1	i remember listning to this album over and over again when i was young to this day i still ca n't get these awesome songs out of my head ! a must get album for you old school folks or anyone that enjoys great music	9
0	this lifts your heart to god as you listen beautifully done	9
1	great music great band this is a must buy recommended to all hard rock lovers	9
1	do i mean the best album or the best singer \? you are correct if you said both ! i saw kristin chenoweth on a pbs show broadway 's best at the pops \( though it was not the first time i had heard her \) and decided to check out the offerings here this is a collection of the kind of music and performances i love she has a great range a precise pitch and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself in an era when singers try to outdo each other re interpreting the composer 's original work not usually with great success she is a blessing	9
0	this is a cd of the history of the band interesting but was not a music cd was not worth the price	9
1	if you are a fan of oscar peterson this belongs in your collection	9
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade thus putting me in constant cravings for new material though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch truly vast and intimate at the same time and a voice that speaks to something very deep sad and lovely inside you	9
0	come on i cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular cd players j mc are excellent though	9
0	i bought this cd for the avril lavigne song keep holding on i really like her song and this is the only way i could find to buy get it was to buy the eragon sound track i havent seen the movie besides that i would n't have bought it	9
0	very disappointing nothing like riverdance would not recommend and i am avid fa	9
1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell 's the cadenzas are absolutely awesome i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician highly recommended	9
1	these 3 discs \( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! \) are a continuation of live dead if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band the playing the interplay between the musicians particularly garcia and lesh is staggering and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums	9
1	hey ! it 's johnny cash ! you ca n't go wrong purchasing anything by johnny cash	9
0	\( \) this cd is sub par most of the beats are cool but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics	9
1	these tunes may not immediately remind you of steve miller but his talent is not belied it 's some really peaceful music great to turn on just at bedtime and drift off to la la land	9
1	i owned the album as a kid i enjoy it as much now as i did then	9
0	only way you are gonna like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk and you think that 'll make you cool this cd just does n't display musical talent maybe originality but this is not high quality music	9
0	this cd has some good songs on it but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected they are mixed together and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs buy this but i would n't recommend it otherwise	9
1	relationships and drug use are major themes this album starts off with two absolute killer tunes lets down some but has a joy thoughout i ca n't believe this is going to be his only album what a shame from someone who has been listening to rock for a long time i tell ya this is a blast pure fun something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love mostly rather quickly paced one of my favorite albums of the 90s more people should listen	9
0	there are only a couple of songs i did like on this cd i did enjoy ice cube and aaliyah but the rest of the cd left me cold i do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them it would have been better ! i suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy	9
0	all the cds this band has made suck not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made blink 182 sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk pop	9
0	im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately \( think tony gayo \) there are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore all prodigy does is spit run on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he 's just there to be there amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them did we really have to hear this one to see that \? if you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving	9
1	always loved this group own several of their cd 's and this is by far my favorite darryl hall 's phrasing of his songs are superb	9
0	mostly bland by this time it seemed that bad was dead in the water nothing here matches the excitement of this is especially annoying are `sightsee mc ! ' `ice cool killer' and `the big v' bad goes rap \? no thanks it 's easy to see why they did the whole bad 2 thing buy the globe instead	9
1	purchased this album because of the great album cover was i surprised when i popped it into my cd player i had n't heard of rick braun before but after listening to this cd i ran out and purchased everything he has ever recorded never have i heard a trumpet sound so beautiful share this music with someone you love	9
0	do yourself a favor and only buy his albums they 're much more solid one love peace	9
0	no strings attached is to my memory one of the worst albums ever made no one listens to the stupid boy bands anymore this piece of c p does not sell even a thousand copies today unless the previous reviewer is buying up all the million copies himself dont buy any album from n stync or the equally horrible justin timberlake get any beatles album instead	9
1	sorry ya just ca n't replace michael hutchence this is a great overview of all of their greatest hits i am not a huge fan of greatest hits cds b c people tend to buy them and therefore miss all of the excellent songs that were n't released as singles all inxs cds are worth buying separately but if you must this will work	9
0	if any kid music annoys you this cd is not for you these are good old classic songs but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs i'm throwing it away i want my two year old to know the songs i know and love but this was a bad buy on my part	9
1	in the early 60 's etta james was to r amp b what patsy cline was to country she could cross over and yet remain true to her roots and that 's only one part of a nearly 50 year career ! from the velvety cross over soul of quot at last quot to the hard driving memphis soul of quot tell mama quot this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today she ranks right up with aretha franklin as an influential vocalist i took far too many years to discover her power if you have n't given her a serious look yet stop wasting time and begin here	9
0	as if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound this band sounds like a even more flaccid killswitch engage a hawthorne heights silverstein with downtuned guitars as if it wasnt an abomination already they even sing about vampires yes thats right vampires and you couldnt get any g yer	9
1	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues he was and is a great rocker but his true calling is as a bluesman this is a great album	9
1	this is a great collection of the many atom bomb songs that are in movies such as atomic cafe dr strangelove and other films of the genre i highly recommend this to anyone who collects bomb memorabilia	9
1	i like every song but 1 on this cd they 're the same ones that 're on the movie and if you do n't like the movie you probably would n't like the cd	9
0	i'm a big fan of great big sea and i purchase everything they release apparently they were trying to give this cd the feel of a live medium size venue performance unlike their other live dc offerings this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro cassette tape in some fan 's front pocket it does n't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound overall i was pretty disappointed and i 'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one	9
0	after reading her excellent halloween book i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning i always search for different halloween cds but this was filled with the same old stuff chains moans and spooky laughs then more chains moans and spooky laughs very dissapointing	9
0	any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as boulevard of broken dreams \( a 1934 hit song \) deserves to be ridiculed not rewarded with a grammy i'm just full of original ideas i ca n't decide whether to write a song called wake me up before you go go or grandma got run over by a reindeer or maybe do you know the way to san jose \?	9
0	who in the world called this ''hard rock'' \? ! \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? ! ! \? this is a bunch of self pitying mainstream jibberish nothing interesting at all i shall dub this as ''alternative whine''	9
1	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
0	any one who is a fan of luther vandross will be sorry if you purchase this cd it 's not a tribute it an abomination	9
0	great recording but if you want to actually use it like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm meaning you ca n't don't buy sony products ! !	9
1	my roomate from two years ago had a cd of doris and i must admit at first i was a little skeptical but soon i became stunned by her vocal prowess and the emotional heart juice that she brought to these classic songs plus you should see her in a football uniform ! man can she catch the pigskin	9
1	while nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry between travolta and stowe the sublime soundtrack is another story descriptions such as haunting and soul moving are right on the money one might also add ineffable to the list	9
0	the singing is terrible on fly me to the moon do n't take my word for it listen to the free sample supplied by amazon com at 16 seconds into it when she sings all i worship and adore she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it the rest of the pieces sound fine	9
1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is 'is it for me' it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful \( at most times \) pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums	9
1	this album has some of the best country songs in the business mark sings songs straight from his heart there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like quot too cold at home quot quot i 'll think of something else quot and quot almost goodbye quot to the fast heels kicking quot bubba shot the jukebox quot and quot going through the big 'd' quot these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart so if you 're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they 're gone this is the album for you	9
0	i got this cd because i loved their radio hits bring me to life and my immortal while those songs are beautiful they are not representative of the rest of the album although i tried and tried to get into this cd the hard rock teen goth style just is n't my cup of tea and the lyrics are too depressing if you are a fan of bands such as linkin park or seether you might enjoy this however if you only like my immortal and bring me to life because of amy 's powerful vocals you 'd be better off listening to tori amos or sarah mclachlan	9
0	if you do n't have the blues this record will give them to you musically speaking it 's tripe	9
0	i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop rock this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub par some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why \? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is mold fitting white noise	9
0	i never could understand why the beatles are so popular \? they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds i just dont like it because it sucks ! dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below the beatles only made one good album and that 's the one which contains ballad of john and yoko hey jude	9
0	a terrible terrible waste of money all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle head paul godfrey is face it no one gives a sh t about morcheeba anymore we 're not interested in who 'inspired' them \( poor annette peacock has anyone told her \? \) the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age old question quot paper or plastic \? quot	9
1	i'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews this cd is amazing it 's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave but it 's amazing none the less every song on here is beautifully written and as always cornell 's voice does n't disappoint it 's different but one of my new favorite cds	9
1	it 's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album this is a timeless work it never gets old no matter how many times it is played i 've had this album for 5 6 years and i pull it out every summer great music for boating or bbq 's on the deck i promise you will love it something everyone should have in their collection	9
1	kudos to harvey fierstein for being so true to the jean poiret play jerry herman did a wonderful score my favorite song was the best of times gene barry turns out to be a good singer esp paired with the talented george hearn	9

1	for those of us who thought phil collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture think again that was back in the early 80s when i heard this it is mastery distille	9
0	this cd is awesome from beginning to end i really enjoy listening to this type of music this cd is a must have	9
0	i purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend a few hours later in ended up in the bin very dissapointing bland and not to mention boring and derivative \( some people from new york would understand what i mean \) in summary not only does kylie mingogue \( i wont grace her name with capitals \) fall flat on cd she also cannot perform live and rely 's on gay camp it up imagery to hide behind \( a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit \) a very bad performer and a shameful album	9
0	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un inititiated i am writing to confirm that assertion i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas tellingly this is the final song on the album otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times	9
0	i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	9
0	this cd is without a doubt amazing stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig his tone is crushing sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song	9
0	do n't think dale can play a song the same way twice did n't like the selection of songs nor the way they produced	9
0	with much anticipation we awaited the arrival of clay 's second album thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career while clay 's voice still sounds great the cd is an entire collection of uninspired underproduced remakes not one of which goes beyond the original as you can see this cd is nowhere on the billboard charts and we 're very sad to say in our household that it 's for good reason save your money and buy one of the much better idol cds and almost any of them are most recently kelly pickler and carrie underwood	9
1	this cd is truly a classic and one of my all time favorites love it	9
0	nothing even close to say no more i'm sorry i spent the mone	9
1	this is lovely stuff the other reviews say why much better than i can but i just had to add to the adoration	9
0	this album sounds to much like pop music than hardcore reggaeton they even have that rbd boyband in this piece a few years ago lt saved reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even grandmas like and that is scary the only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel de la ghetto songs if you wanna hear some real reggaeton look for producers like dj memo meka mambo kings dj wassie dj fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin reggaeton calle my friend	9
0	if you want the original recordings do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of the beverly hillbillies and the munsters that just do n't sound right to me if the original recordings do n't matter to you then you may like this cd	9
1	for those who have watched the movie jaws \( ask yourself who has n't \) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information which gives the overall package a nice touch the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	9
1	i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention shoegazers \? \? \? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger just buy it and all the rest	9
1	i must agree with the comments made by other reviewers this album is great nancy wilson 's voice on this album is unlike anything i have ever heard you ca n't honestly say you 're a fan of jazz if you do n't own this	9
1	this album sparked the so called neo soul movement years before it was adopted by other artists back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and prince broke the music back down to its roots this concept was later used by tone tony toni brand new heavies and d'angelo	9
0	nothing like eon eon is the one this was a hack sequel with no guts very dissapointing	9
0	well unless you are a hardcore collector like myself \( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago \) stay clear of this album if you want to hear noise that you your wife girlfriend boyfriend could do yourself then forget this album make your own noise the best track on the album is the bonus track that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging \) search judemac forever on msn	9
1	i got this disc for one song the uncut full length version of boogie wonderland by earth wind and fire \( with the emotions \) the rest of the disc is good but boogie wonderlan is in a class by itself ! ! five stars !	9
0	jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice but you wo n't get the chance to hear it on this cd this cd is a complete let down it is her worst one yet ! do n't get me wrong i love jessica but seeing her waste her god given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so tragic	9
1	this is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic lyrical wizardry was the order of the day if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic the production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other buy this ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	this cd is absolutely wonderful i am in australia so strawberry shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the usa so you can imagine my daughters delight when this cd is being played the songs are just gorgeous i just wish they were a little longer i thoroughly recommend this item to any little ss fans	9
0	hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they do n't mention is that it 's impossible to listen to there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of there are no songs it 's just a sound collage or something from start to finish the booklet prints lyrics but i could n't find 'em this music is too brilliant for its own good and you can forget about using it as party or background music jdub 's other offerings are much better	9
0	this is not i repeat not five stars ! in all honesty it 's more like 1 5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug atmosphere albums like overcast godlovesugly the felt project and the dynospectrum album is much better than this though the lyrics are thought provoking but slug has been better the production does n't hold up it 's some of the weakest i 've heard from rhymesayers there 's only a couple tracks that stand out but i 'd have to say do n't ever f king question that is the best if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album slug spits classic verse after classic verse	9
1	mountain music offers what alabama is famous for great music and great harmony all packaged together the title cut is great that harmonica and quot old man of the mountain quot intro is unique as for quot close enough to perfect quot if any man sings that song to his lady she is his forever the cuteness of quot never be one quot also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it there is n't a bad song on the whole cd and will make a good addition to any collection	9
0	something that someone who claims to be country should not do even though these girls are already pop remixing it to make it even more pop was a huge mistake ! then again they have to do something to sell more cd 's ! lol ! !	9
1	this album is just non stop funky i originally got it just because i loved living in america when i first heard it but i was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the cd just as good check out turn me loose i'm dr feelgood let 's get personal and gravity they 're among the best on the cd	9
0	when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony one can only be disappointed in diva destruction 's music the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut	9
0	i'm sorry to vent on the stylistics certainly others are guilty of this but 33 to get all the stylistics hits is way too expensive sorry love the stylistics and the spinners too \( whose double cd anthology is around 30 too \) why is something like lionel richie and the commodores 2cd gold 13 99 \? oh well i 'll wait	9
1	this arrived the other day i pre ordered it two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion its about time this was available on cd and here it is sounds great ! go get it for the collection	9
1	when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights but by the music she sang and how she deeply richly portrayed those songs she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her music she truly is addicting once you hear these songs these songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey	9
1	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original metal box of ep 's when it first came out years later the second edition came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out eventually the second edition came out on this cd so i finally could own a digital copy myself pristine audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion if i remember correctly you do need to listen to this you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too	9
1	unique highly artistic creative more credit to drummers beatifully polishe	9
1	trace adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more ! can trace ever produce any music that sounds bad \? his low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his god ! i strongly recommend that everyone has trace 's latest cd in their collection ! a big ten four in my cd player	9
0	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong i click on one song and get another from on the list what gives anyway	9
1	anyone who had access to a radio in the 80 's would know at least two songs by missing persons their fun music and amazing flare \( dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great ! \) make this a good party album i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great just as an added note warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran \( my personal favorite band \) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986 ! !	9
0	i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd a system i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing and the mix to be a bit over the top with surround effects major vocals coming from rear speakers etc i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk in fact the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song let 's get it on and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection if you are looking for dvd a disks with 5 1 surround i 'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album	9
1	wow what a great cd i'm a big music fan of alot of different types of music and i have to say that this is one of the best cds that came out in 2004 you ca n't go wrong with this one a	9
1	tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo alternative style of rock the first released single the adventure is quite enjoyable and even though i have n't checked too deeply into it i think it 's the theme song for nbc 's studio 60 besides how can you go wrong with an album that 's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada	9
0	first of all i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it leaving me to pick it up i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning if you buy this consider yourself warned	9
1	if you are a fan of the winter 's solstice series than you will enjoy this cd especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music	9
0	this stuff is so boring i ca n't believe people still listen to this stuff seriously come on people ! i laugh every time i see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere plus busta has admitted to having relationships with men if you get what i mean makes you wonder about a lot of rappers	9
1	la pelicula es mas o menos pero la banda sonora es buena en especial la cancion 1 crush de garbage es una excelente cancion	9
1	no collection of blues rock is complete without quot a piece of your soul quot there very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc from the raunchy \( quot bitter rain quot \) to the uplifting \( quot good day for the blues quot \) to the bittersweet \( quot cynical quot \) to the soft \( quot share that smile quot \) storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island	9
0	i was very disappointed that the version of quot paper roses quot included on this cd is an updated and new recorded version from 1990 it is not the original 1973 classic marie recorded when she was twelve interestingly this new version is produced by sonny james the original producer of the original single that also features many of the original studio musicians so all is not lost still i prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this cd included an updated quot paper roses quot	9
1	link this cd of great melodies with the best of the browns \( 1954 1967 \) you 'll not regreat the quality such easy listening this group is simply the best i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book looking back to see a country music memoir it 's a well written \( and interesting \) cover of the the history of the browns	9
0	bill charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented lyrcially blessed jazz pianiasts around today he has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences that told i find it very hard to give his latest effort stardust more than two stars with very few exceptions i found this cd to be fairly self indulgent and charlap rather morose in his intrepretations it was n't nearly a refeshing to the ear as written in the stars i would recommend this for a charlap devotee but no one else he has made better albums	9
0	very very dissapointed e 40 raps too quick he is too hard to understand and he sounds like a trick	9
1	bo diddley is one of the most underrated rock and roll artist such gems as quot bo diddley quot quot say man quot and quot who do you love quot are just the tip of the iceberg add in the blues like quot i'm a man quot and you have a truely outstanding set the set also includes a very informative booklet that includes a bio pictures and discography do not settle for less than what is offered here	9
1	i just loved this album the songs really related to my life it was nice to see that there was personal experience involved while writing the songs	9
1	what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd have n't already said arthur is outrageously talented it 's almost shocking the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense it 's extremely well recorded and mixed music anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now stumble and pain is probably my favourite track the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense layered and its something he 's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album ! anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption 's son straight after that what a musician	9
0	so far so good so what ! \( in it 's origional form \) used to conjure feeling the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did n't quite hit the nail on the head if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s get your hands on that version	9
1	this is an amazing cd i cannot believe that more people have not discovered charlie sexton the songs are personal and beautifully written the music rocks and yet it 's different than any of sexton 's other music he is a brilliant artist and this is a brilliant wor	9
0	flcl is the worst anime of all time and possibly the worst thing to come out of japan since the pearl harbor attacks and the soundtrack is just as bad if not worse its nothing more than j pop mixed with bad japanese rock bad guitar playing boring drum beats and inaudible bass you 've heard one pillows song you 've heard them all only otakus with no life love this s \( like matthew g salisbury \) if you want good japanese music go for king 's evil ps that album cover is possibly the worst ever made	9
1	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	9
1	incredible follow up to rated r which i did n't think could be equaled and they did flat out incredible songwriting amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best if you grew up in the 70 's as i did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you go with the flow is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you wo n't be skipping any songs on this disc baby boomers rejoice rock is back	9

1	pete rock and c l smooth came out of no where with this classic in 92 i was expecting the t roy tribute to be the only highlight but this joint was bangin ! the very underrated cl had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics chocolate boy wonder had the legendary horns going on the whole album is a banger fav 's are pete 's sake the basement \( pete 's cuz heavy d rips it \) mecca and the soul brother troy they reminisce straighten it out \( a kick in the balls for bootleggers \) ghetto 's of the mind and skinz \( cl 's cuz grand puba steals the show on this one \) eternally classic rock on	9
1	i recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like i was listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh life on planet groove will be a welcome addition to your collection great for the drive	9
1	i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny mono phonograph i loved it then and i love it now rainmaker i'm on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles i would have loved you anyway is the only song i do n't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that 's ok ! the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy ! i do n't care if it 's the memories or not i enjoy putting this on and turning it up	9
0	it 's not as good as his other albums he tries too hard and he praises himself way too much poor guy no wonder it had a fake case	9
0	buddy holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th century masters series every one of the cds in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous this one is no exception look elsewhere	9
1	please do yourself a favor and buy this cd ! whatever you do dont listen to it in your car though no kidding aside i almost ran my car off the road because i was laughing so hard	9
1	i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re released if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia this is the set for you !	9
1	i never loved a man the way i love you what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time this album released all of the music in aretha that was screaming to be released it displayed a very mature aretha with complex emotions very everyday lyrics ones that make you say oh yeah girl lol but also a delivery that the average person could n't lay down and dream about pulling off this is just testiment that even at such a young age she was the queen	9
1	good cd but where is his recent hit quot i wanna feel that way again quot and his classic hit quot walkin' to jeruselum quot	9

1	michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana this record is her first with friend jessica harp the ladies mine the borderline between the singer songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format highlights include the opening track leave the pieces way back home the good kind and the title track stand still look pretty of special note is the presence of producer multi instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks i recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't sound like formula country	9
1	stick to singing in spanish shak	9
0	this was just to much country for this parrothead i liked one song piece of work and that was about it	9
0	on the track cleo 's mood it sounds like something that bookert and the mg 's along with the mar key horns would 've cut it sounds like steve cropper on the guitar and booker t jones on the keyboards the sax style is definately jr it 's a soothing piece	9
0	i bought this album after hearing america their single off this album and listening to the increasing hype about razorlight and johnny borrell being one of the most talented singer songwriters of his generation this follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first it 's not bad but it 's not that good either the songs all sound like i 've heard them somewhere before and the lyrics well how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone nothing on the radio and not known what it all meant while smoking cigarettes late at night yawn	9
1	what a beautiful album ! one of the rare albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts i 'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh	9
1	the performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful this is the kind of material one can expect from deutsche grammophon wonderful music a wonderful violinist wonderful interpretations and wonderful sound \( not just for its time \) there are also very few squeaks and he is almost always right on pitch ! often called definitive this is the one to get highly recommended	9
1	at first i did n't think there was enough new material on this soundtrack to make it worthwhile but the four previously unreleased songs are so completley wonderful especially quot all i want to know quot and quot heather quot this is an essential for any stephin merritt fan	9
0	i wo n't dispute emmylou 's wonderful voice and mark knopfler 's superb guitar playing but this album just did n't cut it for me pretty lame about as likely as hank and phoebe snow	9
1	does anyone know whether this set will become available on sacd or dvd audio format \? how would you contact grp records to ask \? i only give it four stars until multichannel format appears	9
0	this cd is pretty awful you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd one of the worst songs ever is calling it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground na na na na na na na na i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer	9
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	9

0	ok i 'll make it short but sweat great music singing sucks this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock if you think i'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice he can't hold a note and sounds like he has a mouth full of mush he sucked atcountry and has no place in rock home boy go back to texas andget back to branded some cows cause you suck	9
0	bad news is that i wasted my time listening to this whinefest good news is that i bought it used i give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the cd and she is a cutie more good news i re sold it for my purchase price	9
0	nana has a beautiful voice but her singing is monotonous predictable she lacks passion sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song in addition to this the arrangements are unfortunately very poor her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles but this is not the album i would like to listen to again and again	9
1	my personal favorite dashboard cd every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that i like but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis	9
0	while i love billie in her own words these sessions were dull and uninspired since the reviews should focus on one cd that is the jist of it boring renditions and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection	9
0	sorry to say i'm not a huge fan of tanghetto even after seening them play live at la viruta last month few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while i say if you want neuvo tango try narcotango or otro aires	9
1	this cd has tons of power and soothing energy it really shows off how well part understands the human voice	9
1	excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic dutch band each tune was a single sometime between 1965 69 these guys are not to be confused with a u s band from the same era of the same name cuts that make this cd a true keeper are sun 's going down the tripping feel like i wanted to cry keep on trying the familiar sounding touch and ballad of john b this is yet another band i 've heard at least one or two tracks on the rhino release of 'original artyfacts nuggets ii' 4 cd box set should appeal to fans of pretty things q65 early beatles creation and the action a must have	9
1	the one song i know is a remake is goodnight my love i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake but the others with which i'm familiar but do n't have original vinyl to compare only memories seem authentic the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re recordings of old vinyl or cassettes	9
0	these songs are hacked up versons of rick 's music i played it a couple of times until i got the library of original lps the lps are better at least they carry full versions of songs i pass on rick and this package rca cheats people out of good music	9
0	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy this cd was very boring the beats are too similar on every track and the cd as a whole just has no quot feeling quot to it if you want to hear him at his best by 97 octane	9
1	the first time ever i saw this group amici forever as they were singing unchained melody i have confused that song like classical music because it was very familiar actually i did n't know exactly what 's that song that moment finally i knew that song is popular music i used to sing so laughed myself it was brilliant and great performance i ever heared before i bought dvd too and i recommended my friend and he also felt their singing like me he said great and thanks to me	9
1	tim mcgraw does it again it is a great album with some really great songs a must have	9
1	one of his best times all the songs on this cd are great he express his fellings very openly with this cd people can really see who marc anthony really is	9
0	well i like the song i shall believe and that 's why i purchased this album but it would have been better to buy just the single	9
1	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't and these days that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan	9
0	hooba stank stinks and will always stink i do n't know about the rest of the cd but listening to the reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal i'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn egad	9
0	trash and irrated plus the good albums ya 'll give them 0 's so now i'ma let the world know	9
0	this cd isnt real good if you like compilations than get the ruff ryders c	9
0	i loved shedaisy 's first album the whole shebang and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed this is a very dark and depressing album almost every song is about lost love also all the songs but 1 are slow where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with \? \? \? i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again still i look forward to what the future may bring from them these sisters have alot of talent	9
1	released is the kind of album you put in kick your feet up with a good beverage and head off to someplace on the silverscreen of your mind that is pure tranquility oster 's trumpet echoes on long after the music is off here 's hoping there 's more from this new and amazing artist	9
0	i absolutely love charlotte church 's voice but i could n't stand even 1 song on this cd she 's lowered herself to a brittany spears wanna be monotone songs horrible bass every song sounds the same i am extremely disappointed in this collection of music buy this one and you 're just wasting your money would the real charlotte church please come back \? \? \? \?	9
1	hot hot heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest their first release was decent but elevator is even better great tunes drums and guitars and of course steve bays' yelping vocals there 's only three songs i really do n't care for pickin' it up soldier in a box and shame on you looking forward to the next cd	9
0	this movie was only good because of two reasons rammstein and queens of the stone age other than that completel out of control p o s that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell	9
0	this cd is 100 pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive either if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better stop this s y music !	9
0	when will amazon allow a zero stars rating \? \? \? \?	9
1	this is the best cd i have ever listened to ! i highly recommend i	9
1	have loved this album since it first came out years ago \( bought on vinyl lost to the mists of time \) the cd was out of print but i kept looking and found it on amazon \( it was re released \) yeah ! ! ! ! last steam engine from the cradle to the grave louise owls you do n't have to need me some of my favorites this to me is kottke in his prime	9
1	i absolutely loved the string music on track 3 i remembered it from an old pc rpg called quest for glory iv i was disappointed to find out that track 4 was only a minute and a half long because i grew up loving that song from the various places i heard it \( fantasia and a kid detective pc game from the late 80 's \) overall though grieg 's greatest hits is a must have for collectors of classical music grieg is revered as norway 's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines	9
1	i was first touched by pavarotti 's voice as a teenager in the early 80 's when i saw a pbs special of this concert on television the power of his voice and his personality are incomparable his rendition of ave maria is especially touching i would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience as i was so many years ago	9
1	as one of the founding fathers of today 's heavy metal rock music iron butterfly has them power drive and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music this live album serves as a testament to that fact eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960 's through the mid 1980 's was primative at best \( by today 's standards \) this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart topping group of that era this is a must have for all iron butterfly fans	9
0	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album i expected a hard hitting original instead we get re arranged covers and lots of filler salsa no surprises here the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious you 'll play this one once	9
0	tihs album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day i like all his other albums better i do n't know why he decided to release this crap but the only song i really like is hip hip qurtables	9
1	i love to working with this soundtrack in the back ground the music is fun whimsical and out of the ordinary i like pop and rock but sometimes you just need good music without the lame lyrics	9
0	this album was one of my biggest mistakes \( bought it 3 years ago \) it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative rock band better you buy instead up the bracket \( the libertines \) orsome strokes stuff	9
0	what 's up the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune \( which i always thought would have been the perfect song for heart \) is the only thing good here the rest of this album is a mess linda perry has of course gone on to better things	9
0	i like funny rappers who have some talent at least i do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all and even the people that i know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they do n't like it at all by the third time truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke avoid this one	9
1	there is nothing more intimate then the human voice i am a voice major at a university nothing speaks to me more highly then choral music i was a little skeptical about this cd when i first got it i have since fallen in love with every aspect of it of course if you get this cd you must get the companion cd lux aeterna by the los angeles master chorale you cannot have one without the other	9
0	gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great i just want to point out that the double cd 'best of' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import	9
1	this record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium i am partial to good songwriting and bill 's particular folk country alt emotive sound the tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back it was well worth the trip	9
1	at the end of the day when you come home from school or work one ca n't say quot i feel great quot rather than great we are stressed and tired the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly i too am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain and it does work it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping with quiet natural sounds it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you	9
0	i remember listening to this years ago and i thought i would add this to my cd library now i know why it has been years sense i 've listened to it very sqeaky dull slow paced stuff bob segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil	9
0	i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words although the music is nice i know she would not be too impressed we had seen the movie together and we loved mr ray 's song and wanted to know the words it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it	9
0	the most untalented producer in the business honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with biggie and black rob 's only one hit the rest of this is trash especially those chickenheads total and once again puff tryin to eat off biggie carcass dont give this bum anymore money just listen to biggies two gems and f the rest	9
0	this album made me realize that darn record company produces for examle two regular albums two best albums two tribute albums and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds like new but actually an old albums from a musician this is an example of the mixture of previously released re released at last over released best tracks with a sounds like regular album title let me tell you one thing jp is dead and gone since rob left the band i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you 'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying	9
1	if you are looking for true hip hop this is a must for your collection four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd quit buying those fake ass hip pop albums and get the real deal from the production to mcing its all there matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks	9
1	a true musical theater classic wonderful melodies that will last for years to come other classics not to forget about are mary poppinsmy fair ladythe wizard of ozchitty chitty bang bandthe first charlie and the chocolate factorythe sound of musicoliverwest side storyfiddler on the roofsinging in the rainthe wizlittle mermaidaladdinbeauty and the beastgreasethe king and ioklahomathe music mansouth pacificmy voice students are always asking me for recommendations so i though i 'd post it for all ! we ca n't forget about these great musicals	9
0	the cd came as promised and in the condition promised i'm very satisfied	9
0	as a huge counting crows fan i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them right up until the time that i listened to the cd it is nearly impossible to get through the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke i rated it one star because there 's no 0 star option if you have any intentions of buying this cd find a website where you can preview it first and thank me later	9
0	the 1 star is for this 5 star cd box set being no longer available does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon \? i have the highlights cd and the live at the plugged nickel double lp but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling thank you in advance for any help scott k fis	9
0	this a great priced cd but the content is why it is so cheap it 's a true amateur album beethoven lover is over her his head this is the real world not a fantasy everyone likes every type of music world deal with it and agree with me it is n't so great	9
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo was cast very well its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 and the sisters even though they were n't the leads they all had such great songs especially beth whose song some things are meant to be always brings tears to my eyes its just so touching i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr	9
0	like so many new age artists ryan farish has a great ear for melodies unlike most new age artists ryan farish has rhythmic problems he likes to use the delay effect on his piano but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing \( sometimes it 's one problem and sometimes it 's both \) i do n't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album also the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly	9
1	europe and japan the final great pop frontiers ! last i heard it was austin \? oh well ! canada shows love too our favorite neighbors do ya a favor ! there are some really interesting japanese based labels search on web and be impressed !	9
1	the debut release entitled breathe by artist called blue stone is one of the best new age albums that i 've heard in years ! i would even go as to say that it is even better than any of amethystiums albums i am is heavenly and contact is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic !	9
1	another hot release top 5 in 2005 so far no one even metions track 7 produced by one and only el producto and track 8 by belief hot cd recommend to those who do n't listin to bull	9
0	mississippi and sugar baby are great songs up there with the best dylan has done however the rest of the album while listenable is n't all that memorable still i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still after over 40 years performing and recording the same cannot be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones overall time out of mind was better although that too was a little overrated with only not dark yet standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs	9
1	robbie 's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination to have a cd that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something i feel so honored to have in my possesion hats off to robbie	9
1	even though gary allen is a country singer he rocks as an artist ! he has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice this man 's voice is so smooth he could melt butter along with any woman 's heart guys will like him too but he 's a crooner his ballads touch women \( sigh ! \) and make men want to emulate him i enjoyed every song on this cd but my personal favorites are tough little boys and songs about rain both beg to be sang along with	9
1	i love these albums get all 3 cause they are great	9
0	i got hooked on tiesto about 5 years ago heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album neverhteless it was n't but it was still tiesto though right \? well the hits on this cd are about 5 years old the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists stick with tiesto nyana 10130340345435 times better	9
0	it has been nearly three months and i have yet to receive the subject michael henderson cd amazon should not be offering this item for sale if they do not have access to a supplier	9
0	i woke up this morning to the grating sounds of good little girls blaring over my clock radio 's single worn out speaker a speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year such as there goes my life and live like you were dying good little girls is easily the worst country song i 've ever heard and i thought neal mccoy was bad ! blue country is the c w equivalent of wham ! \( a dated reference to be sure \) maybe i'm just getting too old for country music	9
1	i was looking for some nice background nature sounds to have playing while i work throughout the day this collection hits the spot great sounds great variety great price	9
1	i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb ! ! i now know that the alien movies rock ! the tone of the music fits the movie i especially like quot ripleys them quot because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through out the movie the cloning learing remebering and also meeting her clones i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell the cast did a great job acting their hearts out jean pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film so if you are n't an alien fan you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks ! jenna	9
0	see bonnie raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `the fundametal things' but no	9
0	i ordered this cd based on the reviews first i have to say that i am not sure why it is called 'paris under a groove' i was thinking that it would be in french at least the beats are nice i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar i just was n't as thrilled as i thought that i would be it sounded very cheap no originality my fiancee is from paris and this was very disappointing not only to him but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present so far it sits on the shelf	9
1	rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired melodies are beautifully simple and soothing sounds are particularly well crafted a great album the drum box could be a bit more discreet though	9
0	certainly not deserving of the grammy \( for cast recording \) each of the other nominated productions is much better than this poor excuse of a revival	9
1	i am a big ambrosia fan and i love biggest part of me you 're the only woman how much i feel and the newer track i just ca n't let go however i wish this cd contained all of their billboard hot 100 hits the cd is missing their cover of magical mystery tour \( 39 \) and how can you love me \( 86 \) for the casual listener this cd is perfect for the chart hit completionists out there it misses a couple songs i bought this cd used for 1 99 which was a huge bargain for the songs included for that price i can certainly try to download the missing tracks	9
1	i was in walmart 's electronic area \( which is where you can usually find me ! \) and i saw the album i heard unbelieveable and i was sold on that song but could n't find the single the album on first listen was not my favorite but after a while i started liking it it is a great album and i'm glad i bought it talent is a virtue !	9
0	i was unable to play in my car cd player soonly choice i got is to listen at home using my home dvd player	9
1	this is jewel 's first cd and i enjoyed it especially foolish games and you were meant for me i ca n't wait for her latest	9
0	i was \( and still am \) a huge fan of mr show it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription it 's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created mr show produced this weak offering might be the least funny comedy cd i 've ever heard virtually all the material in the album has been done before and much better by other comedians most of the bits just lay there and die mr cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f ck a lot sorry it just does n't work do n't waste you money on this one get the mr show dvds instead and forget this ever existed	9
0	this album is n't not very good at all there are about four songs i like first off the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats then the guest artists do a sub par job lyrically then there are no new verses from biggie on the album they should have stopped with born again because album will be a forgotten one not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls	9
1	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt lots of cool instrumentation pete anderson did a great job with the production this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago	9
0	the cd came without a cd case and the cd did not play i am very disappointed	9
0	the songs are boring the lyrics are plain i am so dissapointed i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me andrea 's solo album sucked now this ! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc	9
1	this was one of my first albums i got i got it because of 'paradise city' but got adapted quickly to 'welcome to the jungle' and rest there were only few more metal rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens maiden 's 'powerslave' megadeth 'rust in peace' and suicidal tendencies 'lights camera revolution'	9
0	it 's not great music to dance to	9
0	camera obscura is similar in an inferior manner to nico of the velvet underground nico the band makes pleasantly dull chamber pop in the vein of belle sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years even their name is ripped off of nico 's last studio album camera obscura but as i said before camera obscura is much worse than nico if you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like pick up chelsea girl nico 's first solo album	9
0	aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time they only made 3 decent songs in same old song and dance seasons of wither and janies got a gun rest of the songs just stink explosively avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band steven tyler screams he ca n't sing at all \? \? \? this is music for drug addicts	9
1	i 've always liked tevin campbell he had a beautiful voice and really did it on break it down i particularly like break it down shhh brown eyed girl among others excellent cd overall	9
0	this album is okaynot their best a few songs are goodother thanthat this albumis fair purcahse it with yourmoney intelligently ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back so i bought him another	9
0	i loved her first album but this one is the same old same old rehashed time and time again she has reached her limits i'm afriad	9
1	i personally like this compilation of prince it 's got most of the songs i like and the sound is great sure there could have been a few more songs included like pop life hot thing but when compared to the other compilations this disc has more of the songs that are a must have for me such as i wanna be your lover which i do n't think was included on any of the other compilations so it 's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want so that 's why i chose this disc and i'm glad i did !	9
1	ethereal rhythmic haunting eclectic wake best of dead can dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit the haunting combination of modern and ancient tunes combined with phenomenal vocals and instrumentals make this album one to cherish and listen to over and over each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions	9
0	this is the album when ja officially became a b tch his first 2 albums was good i enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended i hated this s it from start to finish this is a waste of space in the cd case how can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time \? now i do n't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper but you should've at least knew him muthaf er ! another disembowelment to one of pac 's classics i stopped listenin' to ja because he made a big change not cause of 50 unlike some turncoat fans	9
1	this was the first queen album that i ever had so getting it on cd is great sheer heart attack is an overlooked queen gem	9
0	lou reed rocks ! ! ! dude ! ! but methinks this collection dost not the tunes are all good but there are n't very many of them and the sound is deplorable in that inimitable rca first cd edition sort of way \( fans of the jefferson airplane and harry nilsson know what i'm talking about \) a much better jumping off point would be quot different times lou reed in the 70 's quot or even better check out quot transformer quot or quot rock 'n' roll animal quot	9
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible robben can rock and play slow blues every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford do n't miss chris cain this man is also a guitar genius	9
1	i originally purchased this cd at a local store so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all	9
0	ok avoid this at all costs not worth your money ! ! ! ! as luck would have it i found it a a garage sale the only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is vivi 's theme from ff9 the others well they could have done better most of the songs are to put it nicely suck \( at least the way they where done \) the only reason i rated 2 \( 1 1 2 to be accualy \) is because of vivi 's theme at the end this is not whorth your time get the imported cd 's they have much better music on them	9
1	the most juiced up sountern rock around check out the tango guitar on too hard to handle and i always get a kick out of rick 's ole' man it 's a shame that there are n't bands like this around today	9
1	this is the latest entry in the lost legend series and it is the best alblum since the very first lost legends alblum release the songs match up and compliment each other better than any of the previous alblums in this series so well that it sounds like a dance alblum i give it a high recommendation for any surf music fan try alldirect com for the best prices on this series of alblums	9
1	call it american folk call it alt country call it what you like but if you heard this aussie trio on cbs or npr earlier this week suffice to say their in a category all their own love that harmonica up all night by the waifs is appropriately titled i 'll be up all night listening to it	9
1	its a pretty good mix good song choices its mostly a harder mix thought it could be smoother flowing though but all in all its pretty good also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd but hey people gotta switch it up now and then like the last 3 4s better	9
1	sounding thing occurred when ex springfield messina melded with loggins and it was large ! c s n amp y strove to be this good every time they released a tune this compilation not only displays the music crafting abilities of these two in conjunction but also showcases their power to deliver dynamic live performances dedicated to todd j	9
1	this is one of my favorite releases from common this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers songs like i used to love h e r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio	9
1	i would like to point out that mtv rocks is funny and you guys are suckers this album does rule just not as much as top40 radio hits	9
1	chris joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms afros and platform shoes ! joss' you 've been spiked is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever ! in fact this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70 's but it 's all circa the 21st century it 's good to know that there are still modern cats \( especially on the esl record label \) who know how to recapture music from days gone by	9
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco' and its accompaning popularity it is nice \( and a relief \) i might add to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva which are difficult to find anywhere also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces this is truly pure flamenco at its best	9
0	but for the drugs do n't work which is marginal at best this album is boring cookie cutter nothing original	9
0	i bought this cd for one song quot walk away quot which was one of their best known songs i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems there was n't the rest of the album is like an anti climax i would suggest a greatest hits instead if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	9
0	sucks if you like this album you are a poser that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal one guy i know that listens to norma jean as i lay dying and unearth called me emo for listening to acid bath how stupid can you be \? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal such as morbid angel darkthrone amon amarth old sepultura and dissection	9
0	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it i ordered the soundtrack from the movie but it was not the soundtrack they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack i was disappointed	9

1	without getting too much into it this album is pretty good 4 stars for some bad ass tracks my favs are tears from the moon beautiful things as the rush comes all in all worth the money	9
1	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker his band rocked ! after basie nobody swung like mcshann this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides anything by this man is worth listening to another great disc by the proper label who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price highly recommended	9
0	listening to the standards being sung by rod stewart is like listening to classical music being played on a kazoo ! if you 're new to this music try out some sinatra cd 's he 's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the standards	9
1	we really liked the cd of music from the sound track of the movie elf it was what we expected and we appreciated getting it promptly since it is christmas music and we we able to enjoy it all through the holiday season	9
1	like louis jordan his less well known contemporary jump jive artist cab calloway fits into an area much beloved by americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre rock and roll music though in truth i do love jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of r amp b calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive jump music ca n't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart	9
0	i like these guys alot i own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live i played this cd a few times liked it at first but it did n't grow on me at all liked i 'd hoped to cute for me not spontaneous enough i feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time just let it rip guys that 's what you do best thank god my brother bought this instead of me i bought live at cow palace \( the dead \) great cd	9
0	i thought it would have nice soft songs but it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation	9

0	ok booty rap was good in the 90 's when it was offensive and raunchy like 2 live crew disco rick and the dogs poison clan etc but this is just wack weak lyrics corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same and is it just me are these guys as rappers just horrible there voices all raspy and annoying and one the guy 's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr \( what is he on crack or something \) so if you like radio friendly pretty boy music then the ying yang twins are for you peace	9
0	to those of you interested in this cd in lieu of finding the quot songs with lyrics quot in the movie ice age got bad news for you they are not here ! i really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they do n't include the best or features songs in the movie anyway the song that pretty much everyone wants when manny sid diego and the baby are together and walking towards half peak is called quot send me on my way quot by rusted root it is on their latest album quot when i woke quot put rusted root in the amazon search engine and you should find it hope this helps those looking for this song	9
0	i like the music but the sound quality is terrible i bought this cd because it was released in 2003 but there is zero improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks	9
1	imagine yourself sitting in a bistro on the champs elysees sipping a nice glass of bordeux as your glance pulls you toward an alluring you get the picture now buy the cd and thank me later ! highly recommended from someone who thought they heard it all ! bravo senor douglas	9
0	the track selection is fine and okay but the track order is bad no flow ! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile the mixing is terrible and abrupt its basically not mixing no art there	9
0	while the title cut with joe public was bumping most of this disc is so so amp formula driven without teddy riley the grooves amp vibe are n't as strong	9
0	i heard that song recently quot three strange days quot and i recalled how much i detested it when it came out overt pandering to tyros in altered states now i ca n't get it out of my head and may require a lobotomy there was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91 but this was n't part of that canon nice try school of fish have fun playing the cyo circuit	9
0	i used to like good charlotte enough that i bought this cd but i really do n't like them at all anymore they try to look all punk but they are pop they whine a lot i think it 's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool they should at least stop doing songs about it they have some ok melodies and words but for the most part all their songs sound the same good charlottes first two cd 's were almost good but this one is bad and really whiny	9
0	i did not get my order you were suppoused to send my money back i am waiting thank	9
1	i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available surprise turned to shock when i saw the price does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world \( including south africa where i live \) who are very keen on this album \? at this stage though it is only the very wealthy that can afford it	9
0	i really really hate foreigner and i rank them as bad as green day dont make the mistake of buying this disgustingly awful cd which contains trash like waiting for a girl like you which has to be one of the most moronic and stupid songs ever get any led zeppelin album instead	9
1	i ca n't say with the wordsmust listen !	9
0	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it kids also like to eat mcdonalds but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative seriously do n't buy this !	9
1	rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity its not real hip hop this album brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop honestly the light is a song that never gets old thats real if you do n't have this album get it	9
1	originally released in 1972 this was can 's fourth record as well as their follow up to 'tago mago' \( see my review \) some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in \( might take several spins \) are pinch liked michael karoli 's \( r i p \) stellar guitar solos the somewhat stunning vitamin c and this reissue 's lengthiest track the ten minute soup first rate german progressive kraut after i listened to this cd a second time i realized that 'ege bamyasi' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like gary numan pere ubu public image ltd and stereolab silly cover do n't you agree	9
1	this is my favorite bob dylan album the album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever like a rolling stone and my favorite desolation row sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs the album is filled with incredible lyrics wonderful music and a mean harmonica if you want to know why bob dylan is a legend buy this album	9
0	this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now why ca n't people my age stop copying the past \? be original that 's it this style is well worn out	9
1	i own several led flashlights including 3 different ones from c crane company this little unit from garrity outshines them all it is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand if you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights	10
0	maybe i should read the description better but i was disapointed to find out when receiving it that this is just a usb key with a pen and anemic led light no swiss army stuff not even a knife i thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have you know a knife \? that said the usb key is very tiny almost too small on its own \( detached from the swiss army non knife housing \) so it 's good it has a home within the casing otherwise it would probably go missing	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle one of them worked perfect snug fit and everything worked the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic this is my second and last purchase from zefal i was happy it wasnt made in china but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis	10
0	i got this net and set it up in february and been using it fairly regularly i was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment ! should n't a 100 00 golf net last longer than 3 4 months \? completely unacceptable	10
0	i should have read the previous review before ordering because this product did not work at all the on off button did not work click the light produced a very faint light less than a cell phone emits do n't buy this product there are better flashlights out there	10
0	bought it 2 months ago for in door usage thought it 'd last until the end of the semester after less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage punctures started to appear and the patches that came along with the package did n't help much even though the design and the built in manual pump is a big plus the quality is very disappointing	10
1	my child recieved this for christmas he loved it so much his older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too	10
0	first off the knife is great i would n't expect anything less from swiss army only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 and since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it i give the knife a two only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well	10
0	i just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap but there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate what is it for i can twist without it anyway 10 mins after using the machine i got a severe knee injury i didnt have an injury before using it but i got one now i am going to have to get rid of it	10
1	very impressive though it 's a bit big for my two year old he ca n't reach the peddles yet but manages to push himself around without too much trouble i think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old or a big two year old seems solidly built very sturdy stable and sporty looking	10
0	bought mine sometime around christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to st thomas last week it died within 10 minutes of being in the water it was never more than 5' down while i was snorkeling while i never tested the compass or thermometer against known accurate ones it seemed to work well enough for my purposes just keep it dry	10
1	it does the job i have n't had it long enough to attest to its durability too bad the shipping cost more than the product	10
1	i was very pleased with the quality of this product it was perfect for the 11 year old it was purchased for not too short just right sincerely terri j sullivan	10
0	brutal horrible instructions ! no pictures ! no clear concise steps to follow it took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned nothing fits properly it 's very flimsy and unsteady i was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so i returned it do n't waste your time and money spend a little more and get a better product	10
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days the bearings were in great condition	10
1	this is exactly what i wanted ! i 've had so many slipping problems in my ashtanga yoga class both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses here is the answer ! it works great ! i'm very happy	10
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them she was n't really used to skating either but has done very well on them not too many falls and learned easily great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin	10
0	i was very dissastisfied with the product the 16 inch dora bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter we had to keep it in the box until christmas eve so that she would n't find it when i started assembling it that night we found no training wheels or seat i was very upset for obvious reasons how do you tell a 4 yr old that santa forgot the seat and training wheels for her bike	10
0	i cant say anything for the other things but the compass does not work at all north is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same north does does not i was looking for a simple compass keychain this is small and a keychain but a compass that works it is not	10
0	when the scope arrived it came slightly cracked on the end you look through which was n't a good start then when i looked through there was no magnification just small red crosshairs if you are looking for a functioning scope do not buy this scope but if ur looking to decorate your gun then this looks pretty cool on it	10
1	this review is for nike t 90 club team \( 32 panels \) i bought this ball for less than 15 thinking i could n't go wrong i had n't used nike balls before so i did n't know what to expect it turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls great practice ball and pick up game ball i would have no problem using it in a small club match either as far as my 30 adidas balls \? not a chance 5 stars based on performance vs price i hope you get as good a deal as i did \( through eastbay athletics \)	10
1	i had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap now no problem ! it keeps my hair fairly dry or at least drier than with other caps i 've tried it 's easy to put on and take off no hair pulling it 's lasted well so far much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap	10
1	this is the first product i 've ever bought to work out my forearm so i ca n't compare it to anything else but i will say it does work i 've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it it 's comfortable and easy to use i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder though	10
0	this is very heavy and hard to fit anywhere for storage very hard to use even when you adjust the tension to a low setting i tried working out on it for about a week and gave up it will most likely be tossed	10
0	overall the item works well if keeping track of one player it is just fine when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two	10
1	these mats are easy to use and pretty durable but i find them to be too slippery not enough friction a thin rubber surface would be much better	10
1	so many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it ! that 's not what it 's supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is my friend who is probably about 250 lbs did n't even pop it	10
1	the pedometer is just too sensitive ! ! it tends to over state the number of steps that i have taken i like the item but i cut the number of steps that i have taken by third so if i am tageting 10 000 steps a day i try to go 13 333 so that i can be sure that i really hit my target the item itself is well made light weight and easy to use and set	10
0	ab lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna belt \( import junk \) direction manual is almost useless does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used you will need to look at tv commercials and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together their web site is no help	10
0	i couldnt find this item any where but amazon its all my grandson wanted i asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it he said i dont like it i asked why they arent cheep he said it doesnt soot far enough \( oh ! dylan is 7 yrs old \) hope this helps	10
1	i would just like to tell everyone who did n't understand the use of this item they are n't actually anti gravity boots ! they are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling so in other words you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar they are in no way meant to make you float or fly or anything else that can only be found in sci fi magazines	10
1	hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack	10
1	i recently recieved this watch as a christmas gift i am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather i can check my altitude see if a storm is brewing and time each lap of my mile jog everthing works great and is very accurate after a glance through the instruction manuel i was able to use and set all the functions with ease i love the feel of the band it is a perfect fit for my wrist i would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price this watch is truly fun to use and show off it is the perfect watch	10
0	the table is easy to put together but it is uncomfortable on your feet to use	10
0	the first time i did this video i was in pain for three days each time i exercised to this video it got easier but i do n't have fun i have nowhere to put the fanny lifter steps that i did n't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table if i could do it over i would n't buy this product however you will get an excellent workout if you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video \( there is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video	10
1	i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w e u cock the gun with to shoot \? \? \? \? i dont wanna break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it	10
1	this is the best ! i love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves its made me a better runner my husband loves when i take it to his tight shoulders i can massage him so much longer than i could before this is a great purchase	10
0	the thule load bars that i actually received were only 50 inches long and i needed the 58 inch load bars so i really could n't do anything with them it specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars but they were not i even wrote amazon back to try and right the situation but no one contacted me so i had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length	10
1	this case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two weeks per month business travel the good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole the bad part is that it takes up half my carry on suitcase but that 's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment	10
0	broke first time i used it when it worked it was highly inaccurate \( i own a radar speed detector \) save your money	10
1	this is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else it is also useful for true accurate training but a little humor never hurts	10
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship i did n't really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword	10
1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books a little more padding in the straps \( or smaller textbooks \) would make it perfect but it is still better than anything i have seen out there i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	10
0	i was going to give this product a 3 because the trays acutally quite nice just as the previous reviewer i love handing out chips in them however i re read the name of the product and i had to change my vote to a 1 these chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating not only during game play but afterward when i'm trying to store them	10
1	hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product it raelly goo	10
0	i am the captain of a walking team and i purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members i wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it on the very first day the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions and by the end of the day one of the buttons had fallen off i do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers i should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money	10
0	i just saw this toy in parents magazine sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at target this week i ran to get it since my son is too short to use his hand me down red tricycle it looked like lots of fun in the picture however my son is too big for it ! i do n't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old no way ! if it were adjustable i'm sure he would have loved it but just like another reviewer stated it 's just like the other ride on toys we already own currently the scuttle bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store how disappointing	10
1	three things to consider in a yoga block size material color this thing is purple ugly the material is foam and this block will still be around 1 million years after i die for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork for double the price of course finally i like the size of this block most blocks are 3x5x9 this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable	10
1	does n't look like the typical lunch bag that a child would carry and does a great job of keepin cold food cold even without ice	10
1	great little knife i 've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my native is too big super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use only beef is that it 's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size i'm going to have to get the leek	10
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent \( great for hot yoga \) and very non skid it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands wonderful tool	10
1	i burned my hand but it was ok i got to keep 3 of my fingers they work fine but they 're a bit too hot	10
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far it is built well and the price was awesome	10
0	we bought 2 of these things they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receiptthe stitching in various parts of the bag came undone we ended up throwing them away i 've been purchasing things on line since 1995 and this product was by far the worst thing we 've ever bought ! ! ! run away run away	10
0	there was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts my son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road he could not it is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface	10
1	i am very please with my purchase it is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color	10
1	yea man soon as i got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great b bal	10
0	do not buy this bike i got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke the crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat	10
0	i purchased these so i would n't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat however they did n't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws additionally after only a few classes the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws particularly on the foot paws i guess they would be okay for someone who does n't ever have sweaty palms and who does n't do any intense postures otherwise i would recommend doing what i do now use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	10
1	this is a great trainer to start with some people complain that it does n't have enough resistance but it does for me ! i have had no problems with this trainer or any of my cycle ops products	10
1	just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable fast shipping and great deal	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10
1	my treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest strap type that only worked about half the time i never had a problem like that with this one once it 's on it keeps reading until i take it off it 's also compatible with all the treadmills ellipticals bikes at the gym so i do n't have to hold the handles any more	10
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just would n't part with it my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night \( almost 22 months old \) i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous	10
0	received this suit yesterday and used today for first time you do sweat but as one of the other reveiwers mentioned i took off the pants and they tore horizontally thru the crotch seam one wearing and kaput written to valeo will see what they repl	10
0	do not waste your money i wish i could give it zero star	10
1	i bought this mat for my exercise bike it was large and gave my floor great protection i would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment	10
1	this is the second suunto vector watch i have owned only because the first one was lost the only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better the battery lasts about 6 months only for the price of this watch \( 230 \) you think tehy could do alittle better other than that i love the watc	10
0	it has n't broken yet but it is going to eventually i'm 5'10 180lbs and these things barely support me and do n't provide a stable grip these would be fine for a smaller woman but thats really it the pvc construction is n't adequate i thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken	10
0	1 calories shown during a workout are about 1 5 to 2 times actual i do have the right weight entered in my user profile 2 machine broke right after warranty ran out no manual no reasonable support i paid 850 including shipping it is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly nothing about fixing this is intuitive some of the nuts and screwsare so tightly put on you cannot budge them i am going to throw this junk out and buy a non schwinn elliptical thathas a better warranty and real servicabilty customer support at1 800 864 1270 is practically useless save you rmoney buy something else	10
0	the suit will make you sweat if that 's what you are looking to do i had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam i was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine it will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses but buy something more substantial for a serious workout you truly do get what you pay for	10
0	these skates are very comfortable but within ten minutes the stopper had busted no wonder this item is no longer being sold	10
1	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising selected the armband carrier it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the ipod firmly in place it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device if you sweat a great deal while you exercise i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine would recommend it to anyone who asks	10
0	as the previous reviewer said i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper but do n't make a mistake it 's impossible to correct if it is possible i do n't know how as there are no directions using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical with the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made and you probably wo n't even know it just a horrible design and a waste of money	10
1	i bought this for my husband last year and it 's still in good condition we love it the whole family can fit under it it keeps the wind out really well due to the double layers it never ever turns inside out	10
1	this is the best wind up light you 're going to find i advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus i got mine at the local target store and i think it was only 35 00 and well worth it	10
0	the description doesnt mention it but the weights are sand filled bags when using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable	10
0	i guess you get what you pay for this pedometer was difficult to calibrate and continued to miscount steps and therefore distance covered it is made of plastic and came unclipped easily i am a big person and have started walking to improve my health this product does not work for me although it might be a different story for a slim person it has been relegated to the junk drawer and probably will eventually be thrown away i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it	10
1	this spring is of industrial strength it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs better than any made available at your local hardware store it 's only about 4 in long so it does not take up much space however if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag	10

1	hot water in my flask does n't stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature i have n't tried heating water from cold it is always at least warm when i start it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug does n't \( it flops about \) so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush	10
1	this item is well made the tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy the included exercise booklets are lame they have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises	10

1	we just got it i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and i let it sit for a day and a half it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight this works perfectly	10
0	mirrors are too small and too distorted the picture on the package shows a perfect reflection as if ! ! it 's about as useful as taping two foil wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them	10

1	i am very happy with this product it 's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it i had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over but my brother fiddled with it and discovered that \( unlike the rope in the picture \) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it 's not right up against the handle so now i would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it \( and the sellers should have known that \)	10
0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top when we put that top on we found the same thing that is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product	10

0	this compass fails to do the one simple task i purchased it for which is simply telling me which direction i am going i spent for a compass made out of crap materials it works only for the direction you set it at for example if you set it while facing north it will be correct when you go north but if you change directions the result is completely random this compass only works for one direction and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually \( gasp \) might turn absolute rippoff	10
0	this gun was okay when i first started using it it 's really a backyard gun and should only be used for beginners i had it on my bed which is about two feet high and it fell when my dog jumped on the barrel broke the spring in the magazine also broke there are better guns out there but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard this is the gun for you the sight is a pretty nice feature	10

0	its rickety the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion not worth half the money it goes for	10
1	the swim belt i ordered was awesome perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim the great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder it also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim	10
1	i absolutely love this watch and amazons fast and reliable delivery of the product didnt hurt at all i mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if i was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that i have it i wouldnt know what i would do without it a great purchase	10

0	i went to swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others this is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand but i found that the suggested retail is 4 lower to what amazon is selling it for just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price even though amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap probably too cheap to be any good	10
0	its light was okay although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book the main problem is it 's too shabby to survive a battery change so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out also finding 3v lithium batteries is not easy	10
1	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store awesome toy for infants since it 's light easy to grip and easy to bit my son loved this toy for 2 3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys	10

1	i love my jansport odyssey backpack it has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack i have ever owned or tried i have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack ca n't be beaten for tranporting books a little more padding in the straps \( or smaller textbooks \) would make it perfect but it is still better than anything i have seen out there i would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	10
0	a real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings if not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main \( front \) sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if very heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal mart or target for half the price	10
0	i saw this design and thought it was a great idea after using it twice my wrists still hurt now i know why i could n't find this design at my local sporting goods store	10

1	we purchased the mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks the kids think its great it takes a good half hour or more but worth it make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container it can be hard to get off really easy to clean	10

0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	like you \( i'm sure \) i saw this machine on television \( mistake number one \) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first this machine is a joke if you cannot get your legs over your head then maybe this machine is for you but this is not for serious users who stretch everyday i can do more with my 5 stretch band from target than i can with this big heavy space taking piece of junk the resistance is zero and just laughable over all save yourself the money and frustration buy a lightweight no hassle stretch band !	10
0	this pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls but there 's no way to attach it securely to the pump ! the instructions are completely useless does not deserve the one star	10
0	this looks better on tv than it actually works the cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around when it unwinds it does so very slow and loses it 's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with \? what are you supposed to hit it with then \? these things you do n't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up do n't waste money on this item	10
0	the ab roller was a big disappointment for me it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts then once that project was done i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me as a very petite \( 4'11 \) woman my hands barely reached the top bar making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly so beware shorties out there	10
1	even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money but with the box it is almost a work of art \( of course some stain in the bare wood would help \) this cleaning kit is a must for any collector of japanese weapons	10

0	made of a soft steel the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy so it leans forward too much may not accommodate bikes with disk brakes \( the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening \) i had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26 mountain bike	10
1	i bought this net to accompany a kettler basket i recently bought for my bicycle and it fits perfectly it was as if they were made for eachother i can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack 6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical	10

0	while this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application session use of 20 min the second time i tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min even after getting new batteries \( which turned out not to be the problem \) i tried to get the belt to work like before but realized i was scammed it is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones	10
0	the velcro belt tore off after the second use ! within a week of purchase ! the material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight	10
1	i have to say that i love this mat the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip only thing is the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat haha weird huh \? so now you know other than that the mat is visually very pleasing	10
1	most replica type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall not these made out a single piece of stainless steel these are very solid knives as the previous reviewers stated these do come very dull but a file a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that once sharpened these knives are very useable	10
0	this product is not fit for use in any circumstance it definately looks great but thats it ! the product \( ca n't call it a gun \) broke in the first 5 hours of use not combat play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters i am extremely dissapointed with the quality of the product i wrote two letters to the seller manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet not surprised my son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it was well worth it we did not repeat buy and wo n't learn from our mistake	10

0	amazon has the brand mislabeled as apex but it is ipex cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight the rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart the chrome paint is already peeling before even one use also buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time the maximum weight on each is 15lbs \( if i would have thought about it when i purchased it i would have realized both of these \) overall very poor quality i will try to return	10

1	gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes however the d sized batteries \( 1 per glove \) are considerably more bulky than what i expected most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin' d sized battery good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you 'll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out	10

0	i did n't like these at all the toes are too pointy and would n't fit might be ok for younger children than stated	10
0	this machine is too easy even with the additional resistance bands it 's just not enough if you 're an active person at all the assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine i used it every day for a month \( until i felt i 'd gotten my money 's worth \) now it collects dust i 'd sell it for 20 at this point just to get it out of my house i see my easy shaper becoming a goodwill donation in the very near future	10

1	i do n't usually select items by quot name brand quot so i tried many other boots before i tried the timberlands but none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable i have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof \( in rain and puddles thus far \) and have shown very little wear	10
1	love this knife looks great sharp as can be out of the box thin enough for the pocket of my khakis one disclaimer use the safety it opened up in my pocket once \( no clue how \) and could have been dangerous	10
1	great mat provides good purchase even when getting sweaty it is a bit short if you are above 6ft \( like me \) to do ashtanga but is great for hatha yoga	10
0	just disappointed is all was n't what i expected and it 's very cheaply made	10
1	powerbars were created out of necesity to be efficient not to taste like a 2 50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out if you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food eat food like a steak a piece of cake or a banana power bars were made for energy in the 1980 's people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them power bars are practically synonymous with the term energy bar because they are the time honored benchmark try a cliff bar or a snickers if you are looking for something tasty when you get tired of those and long for something more in life try a powerbar	10
1	i got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and i was really excited though as soon as i jumped on it it was n't bouncy at all ! i am not very happy with this trampoline and i do n't reccomend that you buy it	10
1	this clip is great and it does n't just work on utg guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns any one with a shot gun from utg or smith and wesson should buy thisps i'm 1	10
1	they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well	10
0	this gun did n't work from the moment my son took it out of the box the return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so i did n't bother it went straight to the trash can	10
1	its better then shakin the bottle jams atleast once per fill but its only 89c ! ! buy a few and you 'll survive slam on ! ! !	10
1	a great multifunctional stove with lots of room extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind dust and other campground debris out of your food propane is the only way to go when you 're cooking in the wild woods were doing some backwoods camping while the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along a must have for any camping trip	10
1	this gun is really cool ! it has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb 's at a time but hey you ca n't have everything anyways great buy	10
0	i ordered electric gloves i recieved electirc sox i would like the gloves to be sent to me i can use the sox so would pay for them separately the gloves were 29 95 the sox were 19 95 so i should have a 10 credit if you can correct this error it would be appreciated r heins	10
0	we found the system very hard to read at night we could n't see it at all to read it our family bought us the better model for xmas so we are going to put this one on ebay would not recommend it	10
1	this compass is better than i thought it would be especially for the price it 's a great deal i purchased it for a car and it work well for it	10
1	these bikes arrived very shortly after ordering were exactly what i was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble the only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and i did n't know who to contact	10
0	this was a bitter disappointment one of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control however if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting we get horrific feedback \( screeching \) nothing seems to help and when i sent a note to the manufacturer for advice i never received an answer unfortunately i 'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem so it looks like it 'll hit the trash save your money and do n't purchase this item	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
0	it holds my bike but seems unstable i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards plus probably the biggest concern there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack \( user must tie the bike down every time \) my bike has n't fallen off though	10
0	this would be a great tube except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position unless you 're worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake find another tube	10
1	i use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane i do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow it rolls up to a nice compact size	10
0	i found these gloves to be ok for short rides but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful i actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying granted these are mtn biking gloves i do n't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand i 've tried to break them in but after a dozen or more rides they are still stiff	10
1	i struggled with the decision to buy this trike thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth however i ended up getting one for my 3 year old and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius and me and my back thank them i no longer live in fear of daddy push me since pushing does n't require bending over to that terrible pushing a tricycle stance the trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver it has a low center of gravity and does n't feel quite as tipsy as some i recommend it	10
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it 's funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it 's stable worth it \? not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat \( 5mm model \) it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value \( reasonable price \) and it 's biodegradable	10
0	for 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking jogging with a bonus pedometer the radio has no channel display and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial then a scan button when walking it loses the station occasionally luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial but if yours is n't this could be terribly annoying as for the pedometer it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when i was holding it perfectly still thus worthless i'm sending it back	10
1	i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping it didnt take much pressure on the toesto be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running great product	10
1	excellent product great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed the height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly very good quality materials for the price i have had my eye on one in the in flight magazine when i travel but i saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping	10
1	this is the best ab workout machines i have ever bought and it works ! i had no problem with the shipping or the actual product	10
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two after applying one vial it seemed even worse than before \( tread catches as i walk \) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable \( still not great \) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality	10
0	the gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter	10
0	i do n't really write reviews but i felt like i needed to say something about this one maybe its me but i could n't get the pump to work so i bought a new basketball i bought a regular one and bought a pump i wish that infusion thing worked out because it would have been great to deflate it put it in my bag and then pump it up again at the court but my friend warned me they do n't work so good i'm just stubborn i guess that 's my 2 cents take it for what its worth	10
0	when i ordered the product i kept putting on my order for a medium size when the final paperwork was sent for delivery it said it was being shipped and it was a small a small was sent instead of a med thereforewe could not use the product if you can take care of this matter with a return ticket for the small one we would appreciate it	10
1	i'm a single mother with a full time job taking part time graduate classes are night i have very little time to myself let alone any time to go to the gym i needed something that was fun and energizing to do at home after my child went to sleep i found the perfect product ! i recommend this to anyone that wants to get a good workout in the comfort and privacy of their own home	10
0	received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it you ca n't get it to pedal the cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike you need a heavier base and very smooth cycling this model runs on a fabric type band on the inside made very cheap i don't recommend	10
1	we purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the keys the dvd gave her a good overview of how to use the mask snorkel the mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out this was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for	10

1	i have been completely satisfied with jansport backpacks they are very well made and i love the guarantee the straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased my 14 year old son has had one for three years and it is still in great condition previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most this model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you 'd want to put in a backpack great product	10
1	this is the best racquet i ever have i 'd been using wilson for a long time \( 5 racquets \) this one is the lightest and the most powerful i have improved a lot and no more pain in my elbow \( tennis elbow \) thank you for such a great product	10
1	i have stopped at least 5 shops \( walmart sports authority target etc \) to find foosball replacements but no avail the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls the foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
1	perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8 8 oz servings of water each day fill it up in the morning and make sure it 's empty by the time you go to bed at night ! very sturdy and best of all no plastic taste to your water !	10
1	one thing i really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use it holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride it feels good on your back too it helps in this florida heat cons the mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle it would be easier to have a t mouth piece i will be looking for a replacement	10
1	the kids at our church campout had a great time with the aerobie skylighter lighted frisbee 's we bought for them they took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work	10
0	initially the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate it did however give my wife a good laugh she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the tv remote but after one week of use the darn thing became so in sensitive that it would only register when i jumped up and down like a pogo stick pass on this one	10
1	if you 're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles this is an excellent choice it 's also very quiet and it 's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me only problem is that i wish the seat adjustment were easier to work it gets a little stuck sometimes again if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice	10
0	i got this item to give a a gift i got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded do n't bother with this one	10
1	i 've been using these gloves for 3 years now and i had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers what i like easy to setgood wrist supportgood grip with the middle barwhat i do n't like using wraps can be difficult if you do n't take a size above and i recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin for the price and the time that i 've used them \( 2 3 times a week on heavy bags \) they performed very well	10
1	great swivel action tough construction easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag worth the price	10
1	excellent service and a quality product at the right price i had no luck finding foose balls locally	10
0	the padding is too bulky toward the knuckels there is no padding on the fingers the gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves	10
0	face is made of cheap plastic it scratched within an hour of putting it on watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks i 've been wearing a cheap casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it other problems include the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly for example when i put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat also the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch finally the watch is very well photographed in the ad and does n't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality	10
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item i think it is a good concept but it does n't work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything it is awkward to drink from too i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation	10
0	i walk pretty much the same distance daily and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route i could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride etc but off by thousands of steps \? hardly worth it	10
0	prior to purchasing this item i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe i wish i heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis i developed severe toe pain by using this product i then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead	10
0	the compass is wholly unreliable the light button turns on in your bag thus draining the battery one of my worst amazon purchases	10
1	my daughter received this toy for christmas and at seven weeks old immediately loved it my five month old nephew also received one and loves it as well it is easy for infants to grab and soft so they do n't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth the colors are visually engaging and it has a nice rattle sound to it \( loud enough to get the child 's attention not too loud to be an annoying toy \) i recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift	10
1	the bar itself is exactly what i wanted the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles i had on the purchase the bar arrived literally hanging out of the box the box was really really torn up the collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar needless to say the bar was useless untill i finally found some collars on ebay amazon refunded all my as soon as they were aware of the problem overall the bar is great	10
0	the bottom bolt broke a week after purchase which prevents the unit from functioning as designed it cannot swing out of the way	10
1	i love the procuct and it does provide the reslults predicted however i would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or i would like to see something like this maybe in a vest shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach	10
0	i live in argentina i bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa the watch does n't work and i ca n't change it or sent it back to usa	10
1	i'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout i can get by using these high resistance water gloves the unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off wish they had a medium choice of size they only make a s and a l these gloves were a great find and the price was right	10
0	if i could give them 0 stars i would i do n't know why they even still make these as they should be illegal and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate the materials break up easily the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place i could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior but complete garbage right out of the box everlast in general simply is n't good low quality materials design and workmanship but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book i recommend buying entirely ringside and this is coming from an experienced full contact fighter	10
1	i have been using michelin tires for the last 3 years and i wo n't use another brand hands down the best road tires you can buy ! worth the money	10
0	first of al it is not stainless steel it has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap handle is not that reliable it is like it 's gonna break easily i mean do n't think of any usage it is only for decoration	10
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments yes the bag is n't huge but it certainly gets the job done it 's not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it 's a bag that has style that 's why i got it it 's a bit more european in its design and is of good quality i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon look to be good quality also at this price it is such a good deal	10
1	i got this belt because it 's the one my son 's physical therapist uses in his pool therapy it 's great because it gives them some support but not too much you can also remove floats as they get more comfortable in the water	10
1	i recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while one of the suggestions i got was to get a gripmaster and when i checked it out i found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers i ordered one and i can definitely say it was a good investment ! there 's a big difference in my grip now i can even crack a nut with one hand easily \( using a nutcracker of course \) i ca n't wait to try the 7 lb one	10
0	the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring	11
1	contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has no subtitles or closed captions or whatever the r2 neither so again do n't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff non anamorphic or simply 4 3 format no subs not available at all \( yes i mean you disney \) in short no quality or consistency go and take a hike stop lobbying for legislation and start making real dvd 's	11
1	be sure to catch the alternate views on disk 2 the view from the control booth with the director losing his mind in a good way is great they also have a beautiful day from the rooftop in boston	11
0	i do n't think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger \? i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote	11
1	i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace com check it out	11
0	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
0	this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they ca n't sell it so they 're giving them away hide fast	11
1	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	11
0	this is one of our favorite movies but when we sat down to enjoy it the last 2 scene segments would not play very unsettling	11
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11
0	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
0	i do n't understand what the people in charge of producing the wiz as a film could get by joining the former big names of diana ross michael jackson richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture the music soundtrack is by far much better than the movie itself i have lately become a great soul music fan so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work not keeping in mind that it 's a movie soundtrack in such manner you will enjoy it more !	11
1	robin williams is an afrs disc jockey in saigon during the vietnam war he is fast talking zany unconventional and a problem for his superiors williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten the movie is an exhausting experience to watch as it must have been for williams to perform it 's an amazing one man show but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty	11
1	received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems	11
0	i could n't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do \? mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i did n't finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing	11
1	i love anakin skywalk	11
1	its easy to state facts when you talk about the quality of a power tool or a tv but when it comes to things like movies and music its all a mater of opinion my idea of a great movie might be your idea of the worst movie ever made so its not a good idea to buy or not buy a movie based on someones opinion of it i liked this movie in fact i just watched this movie 5 min before writing this if you are not sure if its your cup of tea rent it before buying it i seen it 10 times over the years and i still like it	11
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con	11
0	i hate this film and the ballad of cable hoge because of its depiction of animal cruelty this happens just at the prelude of both films	11
0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	11

0	chuck jones continues to entertain new audiences with the road runner and wile e coyote chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo i found it to be very exciting if you have road runner vs wile e coyote the classic chase from warner bros golden jubiliee 24 karat collection this video might not be for you the other five cartoons actually appear on that video zip n' snort operation rabbit hook line and stinker beep beep and ready woolen and able otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages	11

1	the movie is a bit dramatic at times but those who have studied the doolittle raid and the treatment of the 8 men captured know it does not tell the american public enough about the terrible way humans treat other humans if the americans had been able to know how badly their prisoners were being treated the japanese island might not be there today read four came home for the best view or study other exerpts of various items on the internet i am writing about dean edward hallmark a graduate of paris junior college and one of the three who were executed	11
1	this episode is a classic and is one of the best in the series it explores time travel and alternate time lines and it 's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed	11
1	what more can be said about this film \? filmed on location in rome italy in the fifties greg peck and audrey hep nuff said	11
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	wonderful and beautifully transferred to dvd excellent production numbers and this just might be my new favorite judy movie grab that bucket of popcorn pop in the dvd and let judy do her thing she is wonderful it will be just a fun evening	11

1	this is definitely screwball forget about anything resembling emotional reality this movie tromps along it 's own gay way a lot of the humor comes from the absurd manner cary and irene skip along in their own little la la land of wealth suspicion and inzaniness maybe not for everyone but cary gives one of his classic clueless performances	11
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	11
0	recently i read about the revival of a chorus line on broadway i 've never seen the broadway show or any other staging of it so i thought the movie might give me a sneak peek well somewhat disappointed here i can only assume that the stage version with its long running reputation must be better than this film it 's not that the film is a total debacle but it 's only mildly pleasant and quickly forgettable even songs which i had heard before like what i did for love were reduced to barely a mention in the film the film seemed to lack any real point a bit of a yawner	11
1	i got the dvd in a timely manner and the quality is great great service	11
1	the characters are likable there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film but only about half of the scenes are necessary it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky gene is a funny guy there is no doubt about that but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly except for a few instances of harsh language and violence but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days it is worth a look but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story	11
0	carly simon 's the only one worth watching on this dvd but she 's only in the film for 69 seconds and her only line is i read that sh t you wrote about me and thats what this movie i	11
1	sure the summary of the movie is n't eye catching to some but its a movie that should be seen damnit ! i mean it this is a story about a little boy named ingemar whos relationship with his loving mother slowly falls apart due to her sickness ingemar is soon sent away to live with his uncle and aunt for the summer this movie is charming and has a great cast of quirky charcters	11
0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
1	i am serious ! what is going on \? i look at myself now and do not recognise the guy in the mirrow he likes baseball and football \( american football \) he eats hotdogs and humburgers who is he \? have no idea but the worse part he loved this movie and he fell in love with ingrim bergman for her unbeliavable performance in it forget walter matthau forget goldie hawn they allways good ! but the way ms bergman rediscover for us the story of love when you not 15 anymore she really touched my hart	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11

1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	11

1	flawless and beautifully rieveting the joy luck club has to be the best movie i have ever seen and probably will be the only one of it 's kind the story is beautiful and timeless and i encourage everyone to see it it makes you think of the relationships of your family and how even though this is a movie it can impact you beyond belief it will rock you to the core of your being and i am living proof	11
1	my niece and i love the movie we sing thumbelina all the time the movie is a treasure i just wish it had some special features worthy of the movie	11
1	i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis why though must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again \? i suspect \( and hope \) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you do n't already own any of these and are a fan of broadway theatre or the performing arts in general buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent	11
1	this dvd is great it brings back all the memories of the holidays as a young child it is hard to catch these shows on tv as they only air once during the holiday season my daughters love them and i love seeing their reaction to the shows good buy	11

0	okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people 's relationships \? \? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked	11
0	i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you do n't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny droning music	11
0	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
0	expected more from this movie although deniro was good as usual	11
0	this movie the story of a shocking long ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime the modern day portion of the movie is very tedious elizabeth hurley 's and sean penn 's characters are laughable caricatures anita shreve 's writings never disappoint read the book instead	11
0	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11
0	i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film	11
0	i might have enjoyed this movie more if they had n't gutted the book which was a pretty good read the best character in the book fbi special agent pendergast is n't even in the movie and new york city police lt d'agosta is just a comic caricature of the book 's character another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything if the purpose was to create a moody scary atmosphere they went way too far see if you must but do n't expect too much	11
1	i have loved this movie ro years and was thrilled to find it on amazon ! the story line is cute the acting is witty and if you have ever loved a musical this is for you ! there 's even an interlude with tom and jerry fun movie	11
0	an average movie with average performances glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters it wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book	11
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11
1	i 've always fondly remembered this movie bette midler and danny de vito have perfect comic timing d	11
0	this movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold martin does a great job with nick nolte as an artist in life lessons and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching ford coppolas somthing zoe i began to tire and by the end of woody allens snoozefest i was bored stiff my advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off the first 30 minutes is great film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film	11
0	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	11
1	this study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary long a student of modern art i learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself and enormously important to the on going study of women artists this is a work all admirers of modern art should view	11
1	this was a hilarious movie even though i have never seen it before it had alot of funny scenes but as david rigsbey says it had no direction	11
1	once again fox has cancelled a brilliant show while it is occasionally a bit off color the dialogue is brilliant but apparently people could n't follow the episodes so no one watched this great show and it was cancelled i have n't tried the download option but i highly recommend the show	11

0	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11

0	this movie was obviously made for young children and older people will noyt understand it	11
1	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11

0	if i ever a \) subject myself to this movie ever againorb \) subject anyone else \( including animals \) to this movieform a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review just one question that still haunts me how does travolta 's career survive this debacle and pepper 's hits the tank \?	11
0	this has to be stephen king 's worst work adapted this adaptation is even worse than needful things children of the corn \( i am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels \) was miles abouve better than this garbage just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book just plain trash	11
1	i had viewed this movie on tv a while ago i am a hospice nurse and found this movie so down to earth and informative about what a person 's thoughts might be in the face of a debilitating condition most of the nurses that i work with have gained new insight lest i lead you astray this is not a documentary for medical personnel it is a wonderful protrayal of one woman 's battle	11
0	i recall this movie fondly unfortunately the dvd quality is so poor this cannot be watched pity amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings do n't waste your time until someone cleans this up but it makes a nice coaster though	11
1	a schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world michael a young writer comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity sex bigotry and ultimately a true grim view of society as dark as it sounds i found parts of this movie very amusing housewives pass on this one it 's not 'finding nemo' if you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor satire i 'd reccomend you watch this a true must see for the inebriated	11
1	this is by far the best movie that i have seen that portrays the real life of a gypsy though it is not a documentary but you will learn a lot about the gypsy way of life their music and most of all flamenco in a very beautiful and touching story your breath will be taken away from the very first scene awesome sights and awesome music what can i say ! tomatito performs one of his most beautiful heart felt solo accompanied with a group of arabic musicians this heavenly moment alone is the reason what makes life so beautiful and precious	11
1	it 's right on the scene transitions are nicely done even though a lot of this is predictable it is still funny and makes one eager to see what 's' next fernando literally goes down the line of all the sisters till he has a shot gun wedding with the last the scene between the cuckold and the err cuckolded cuckold is hilarious the sisters are very vivid and pretty \( well except that cruz girl \) overall a very brilliantly done story	11
1	after watching this video i examined the bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy it helps give the bible life so that you can see the reality of creation and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history this is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together	11
1	this two parter commemorates the 10th anniversary of the arthur show on pbs it 's nice they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10 's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how marc brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books it 's nice to see them both together too \( episodes 1 2 \) i think they aired them seperately on tv	11
1	this movie far exceeds its later edition this edition is disturbing but excellent the violence the gore everything is heart pounding	11
1	this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso while it touches on his climb to fame recognition and success in the art world it focuses primarily on his personal relationships i love his work but i sure would n't have wanted to live with him ! the video had therapuetic effects for me i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships how they are and how they should and should n't be a winner all the way around	11
0	i'm a big mann fan and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films thunder bay for instance a great director but this one stinks i ca n't even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11

0	watching the razor release \( which i bought to save a few dollars \) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times fortunately i was able to find the much praised version released by era of taiwan from a seller here on amazon and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog sheer perfection	11
1	most of us have seen the movie a great drama with great acting the dvd is a super clean transfer not any features to speak of but well worth the money invested very clean for a movie made so many years ago mann	11

1	i would have to say this was a brilliant movie i was highly entertained from this mr corman and hill flick beautiful women getting roughed up from the somewhat feminine guards pam grier gets your full attention	11
0	all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man \)	11
1	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama go for this emblematic film where paul newman makes a delirious performance	11
0	what a shame this dvd transfer is so aweful because the movie is great i have seen this movie before on sbs tv \( australia \) and have been wanting a copy since but this dvd looks like a transfer from an already poor quality vhs copy very disappointed	11
1	billy elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class \( meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike \) this is the classic family does n't initially understand teacher believes in him screws up audition but spirit carries him through type movie it 's put together quite nicely and you never really know how it is going to turn out the transition from ballet dancing to tap jazz seemed to happen in one day which seemed jarring the beginning of swan lake with billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance 10 years or so later was a real feel good part of the movie	11
1	bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining	11
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11

0	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it 's one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her	11
1	i saw this on tv and loved it so i had to buy it	11
1	i love this movie so much i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance \( i know so random \) when i was in my teens i went out and rented it right away and i have watched it about 100 times since then i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon it 's such a sweet touching story it 's a bit off the wall but that 's of course what i love about it	11
0	i was forced to watch this movie for college it was the most vulgar unnecessary piece of junk i have ever seen this is a perfect example of the demoralization of america	11
1	'the curse of the grebes' is sort of a tribute to the red sox return to world series glory with cameos by damon timlin and renteria timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by emily dickinson with remarkable aplomb 'arthur changes gears' is also great he gets a bike he 's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he 's so worried about getting it dirty that he wo n't ride it	11
0	i own both blu ray and hd dvd movies and have been consistently dissapointed with all the hd dvd 's they just do n't compare to blu ray the hulk was not a very good movie to begin with and the transer to hd dvd was not impressive picture quality was average at best and the sound quality was also mediocre i have yet to find any hd dvd that is even comparable to the best of blu ray	11
1	micky dane \( robert patrick \) a paparazzo photographer is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder this movie has great action good acting and really catchy music body shot is another robert patrick movie that i 've seen multiple times \( probably about 12 so far and still counting \) you gotta love patrick with his blond hair ! i am biased and give this a perfect 5 stars	11

0	this review may sound pretentious and ignorant but in truth i'm a big fan of british history so bear with me ! even as a film itself it 's surreal and i do n't like the acting but as with any historical film that includes the british they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france \( i e the hundred years war \) but rapists and murdering pillagers ! \? never ! historically accurate full of british sentiment and down right weird avoid this film today folks !	11
1	one of th ebest comedies of the middle 90 's this is basically your average quot rich kid learns to be a man quot story it features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and the mermaid if you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look	11
0	hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very 80 's campy it was corny then as it is now	11
1	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11
0	i loved the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first this movie is boring and did no justice to the book	11
1	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting \( and fast ! \) thx 1138 is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don't buy this dvd ! instead spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch 's involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars \( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover	11

0	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	11
0	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky i found altered states his first novel terribly disappointing the film was in my view utterly dismal the only reason i would recommend it would be as an example of hack movie making if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell both would be relegated to obscurity	11
1	i very much enjoyed this story of a man battling drug addiction alcoholism michael keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead on even when the film is occasionally hard going at times in fact the whole cast is first rate the direction good and the script unflinching and realistic of all the films about drug addiction this one is highly recommended and the ending is even happy	11

0	this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke	11
1	i highly recommend this dvd for its superior acting all hands as well as for the spectacular photography scenery and overall quality of presentation a real keeper	11
0	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
1	there are few great movies that will make shed a tear but this one is really great daughters do n't know how much their mothers will go for them they just understand their mothers when they get to be one this movie the place the weather the circumstances is so depressive but beautiful dolores started to work hard out of love for her child after that she worked because of gratitude what a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end at the beginning i was weary about this movie because is based on stephen king 's work but this movie really proved me wrong	11

1	this is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions climatic extremes lack of water and nutrient poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate this type of recycling may become a necessity hopefully it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts an eye opener for sure	11
0	a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
0	this was on television earlier today it 's a horribly dated film bad pacing bad music with not much of a plot also i 'd suggest not eating at dante 's and please try not to kill the messengers	11
0	an hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay there is n't much else granted there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments but it 's often dull	11
0	this film was dreadful streisand is absolutely unlikeable to enjoy this film you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was along with the english patient this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing	11
0	do n't waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it did n't do any damage to ruin the movie i could n't wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you 'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off do n't waste your money spend it on the cheap 5 6 horror dvd 's because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	11
1	i really ca n't say anything new that has n't been said about this great movie except read jean shepherd 's novels you will get a whole new appreciation for the movie and the characters that have become a part of so many of our lives thank you darren mcgavin for giving us the best christmas present ever	11

1	there are tons of women in prison films out there there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive however this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women who were full of one liners and crazy notions but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film lots of nudity violence bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house	11

0	this version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the dvd and listed in the imdb i saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie the dvd packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by amazon they made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done i do not recommend this version to anyone the orginal movie deserves better than this chop job	11

1	one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his family simple straightforward action that never lets up the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years	11

1	a fantasy dealing with the curse of star crossed lovers ladyhawke never fail to be top notch entertainment the cast is exceptional and get their characters right it 's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what 's going on along with dragonslayer this is one of the top fantasy movies the story is compelling the setting has a very gritty dirty feel to it and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages this is not a movie i can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things because it suck me in every time	11
1	from the first day i watched this video i have picked up so many musical ideas to apply to nearly every genre of music i play \( and being a military rock band bassist i play a lot of different genres \) this video will without a doubt help you become a better player	11
1	this 1960 effort by famed hammer productions of london england is one of their finest efforts and the greatest werewolf film ever made even by today 's standards the make up for the werewolf is eye opening and well worth the wait to see the movie is filled with underlying themes and for those who look it may be filled with a number of messages that are not readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative color photography normally a strong suit in hammer films anyway is among their very best the performance by the young oliver reed as the werewolf is filled with energy and passion a highlight of director terence fisher 's accomplished career if you only can have one werewolf film this is the one	11
1	this is a surprisingly good show it manages to have 'a little' violence sex and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid and it 's still intelligent enough to be interesting humorous and kind of addicting to an adult a modern nancy drew is veronica mars i wish seasons 1 and 2 were here i wish anything more were here and i 'd get that as well i'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest i prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent tv to sell me in that genre so i bought vm season 3 just for kicks i'm glad i did	11
1	this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view	11
1	if you like the typical teenage comedy then you should give this movie a try it does fall for some of the routine story lines that are in every movie like this but it is still a funny movie the best part is probably when they visit tom green 's grandparents i never can get over the dog that talks lol overall like i said if you like teen comedies then you will like this movie avoid it if you don'	11
1	so much is unknown about the valid attempts african americans made to build their own society 's during the 18th century forward this story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in america as free productive people ' my classes sat with eyes glued to the screen it was a horrific awakening for many of my students they were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives that african americans were a useless species well they now know the truth african americans were very diligent in building businesses places of worship homes etc which frightened the cacausion people of that era so they were destroyed and much hope with them	11
0	that 's basically my two cents shallow characters bizarre story i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films but i do like a good story and heard this was one it was not all of the characters were inverted ada and her daughter were utterly irritating george was disgusting from start to finish and sam neill 's character \( supposedly the heartless jerk \) was actually the easiest to sympathize with how frustrating ! on a positive note michael nyman 's score is unbelievable i love it	11
0	not sure what is worse the horrible script or the horrible acting typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script watching schneider dress in women 's clothes for an entire movie is just creepy using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie	11

1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature	11
0	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly	11
1	this outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis please notice how lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama go for this emblematic film where paul newman makes a delirious performance	11
1	this movie gave me constipation that the gods have never seen ! not to mention uncontrolable vomiting when i was a young russian jewish boy before i moved to my navite japan i had a pet lizard named ruby i loved to pet his long hairy back while i fed him seaweed and chives he always loved cilantro \( on the side \) have i ever told you about my uncle clair \? he was 5'6 quot and 423 lbs and wore a 48 ddd bro \( tm \) oops ! i droped my match ! i have to go my parrot is on fire	11
1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	11
1	where are the dvds \? i'm still waiting ! i want it all but especially the second season i 'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc i want good quality discs not too many episodes on each please however i 'll take what i can get just put it on dvd please !	11
0	this is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic i had n't read the book before seeing the movie the film stunk a few years later i read the book and was enchanted i did not make the connection that this was the same story until i saw the film again on late night tv i was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen then i realized what movie it was i tried to sit through it i just could n't the monster should have eaten the film	11

0	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
0	this is what happens when you buy movies that amazon recommends i consider my extreme boredom with this movie my punishment for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy do n't let the fantastic cast lure you this movie is boring ! true it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends more often than not do n't necessarily go anywhere and oftentimes the texture of a movie is not in the conversations themselves but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations but nevertheless do not waste your money on this movie did i mention that it was boring	11
0	this movie was ok i do prefer the messenger starring milla jovovich milla is exceptional in that version	11
1	the dylan \( \? \) lyric to laugh and cry in a single sound came to mind the first time i saw this movie as part of a saturday night film series at the local university 25 years ago it 's just brilliant a wild and manic ride that ends up being completely life affirming you just want to cry out at the end of the movie it 's too good to be true this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen	11
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting so this thing ends and the movie should have also it should have been a 30 minute movie so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs wow what a movie the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie	11
0	but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11

1	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11
1	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is even for a grown up like me it could do without all the songs \( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing \) but it 's brisk double layered humor more than makes up for it kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly adults will pick up on the nearly sarcastic nearly risque dialog so rare in disney animated movies plus big foot dancing to 'stayin' alive' is just freaking hilarious basically it 's just a disney movie but it 's a great \( and severely under appreciated \) disney movie	11

1	i 've never seen the original time machine versions before but i absolutely loved this movie i am of course a big fan of special effects but the story is fascinating ! i 've watched the movie several times and every single time i'm blown away the story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds you 'll continue to wonder where the story will end up if you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel then add this movie to your collection !	11

0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	11

1	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	11

0	this film is about a female student at randolph university in alabama in the early 60 's who is a writer for the school newspaper she gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement it could have been a decent movie but i found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing a much much better movie on this theme is the long walk home and also the ghosts of mississippi	11
1	high energy encapsulation of the american spirit in this tough tender production done lean and hard scrabble as opposed to the lush and green hollywood version curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is aunt eller the matriarch as done by maureen lipman is tough and loving jimmy johnson the welshman jigs and does rope tricks shuler hensley 's jud is repulsive and vulnerable a classic for your permanent library	11

0	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame he 's going home only cause he wants a car shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season	11
0	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11
1	this movie is a classic a young \( er \) nicholas cage is fun to watch as is the entire cast ! one of my favorites to watch over and over ! !	11
0	sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino 's top gun bit \( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off \) there 's nothing worthwhile here	11
1	this is a very enjoyable film in which everything from the acting to the music to the costumes is just right it depicts an earlier friendlier los angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back to an aviation nut such as myself it is heaven perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation the music fits the action so well in fact there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from rocketeer as his performance music most excellent ! the joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film i wish there were more movies like it	11
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
0	acting plot and everything is so bad that it made me cry dragonheart was breathtaking this is b s worst acting and story i ever saw in a movi	11
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
0	this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about 4 5 times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave	11
0	i do n't know what 's up with all of these 4 5 star reviews this movie was awful there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa melle mel and the rock steady crew could save it i could n't wait for it to be over with the graffiti throughout the movie was absolutely awful ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair guy davis was fine back then but not anymore rae dawn chong was just annoying this is one movie i never want to see again	11
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	11
1	oh yeah ! this is the film which set the standard for the women in prison genre the big doll house has everything you could possibly need if you are wip junkie cat fights \( one even takes place in the mud \) group showers sadistic guards scantically clothed gun toting babes lesbianism torture and pam grier oh yeah !	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11

0	i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that do n't make sense	11
0	the dynamic root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children 's comedy my advice to root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash the only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child curtis big props to my man for his preformance hope to see you in more movies to come p s i think taylor root is still a virgin	11
0	i'm rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000 without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the 20 dollar price tag amazon com has right now	11
1	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere if you come across a copy of this buy it it is reminissant of american history x or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen aged boys comming of age while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen this will hit home for the rest of us drugs are bad ! !	11
0	good cast adaptation of king lear do n't bother unless you are really bored	11
0	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
1	the first time i saw this was on abc i thought oh my gosh what the heck is this movie i just could n't stop watching before i knew it i was sucked in to the plot i absolutely ! love ! this movie ! i ca n't wait to watch it again and again and again ! ale	11
1	i enjoyed the film it was uncanny bizarre and colorful wow it' was a nice family movie	11
1	we were amazed that this film was n't an award winner it is an excellent film and you might even see some style similarities between howard roark and frank lloyd wright	11
1	aside from the rather chintzy quality of the disc itself \( why oh why do n't they re release the special edition again \? \? \? \) the film is fantastic kris lemche is as always sarcastically funny and somehow very real and relate able katherine isabelle is quite convincing in her portrayals of madness and mayhem and emily perkins is uniquely lovable as the younger sister trying to save her sibling from the woes of lycanthropy tightly edited and beautiful in it 's cinematography this is one indie horror flick you do n't want to miss ! ! !	11
1	this movie is funny is hell three little words omg i was dying anyone know what song is playing when o'connel is in the car and he starts bumping it \? it sounds like rage but im not sure	11
1	spalding gray is stream of consiousness on speed over before you know it you 'll know a lot more when it 's over	11
0	after a promising start stan laurel and oliver hardy 's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of mgm mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king however chef ollie 's steak a la oliver is worth a few laughs	11
0	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
0	why oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of crime punishment with john hurt using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime john simm i would download the 2002 version all day everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair either offer me the version i want or get the pictures right	11
1	i loved this quirky movie i am glad to have it on dvd	11
0	purely for fans of crappy van damme movies again like i says really corny from beginning to end paul sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one rob schnider is wasted and why the hell was he in this i will have no clue van damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in double team with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said hey ! ! ! ! damnit lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here	11
0	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen of course but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x person or a bond busting sadist this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt carter from gomer pyle totally implausible i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them	11
1	i have three fugitives on laserdisc and i bought the dvd too a must see for martin short 's fans	11
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	this film having been produced in 1957 was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a d i at p i it showed for two consecutive nights and i think every d i on p i somehow arranged to see it we wanted to see if they got it right i guess i viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic a most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times i highly recommend it	11
0	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
0	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse jet li was pretty good but how the hell do you screw that up tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie but it still turns out horribley i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	11
0	after purchasing this i have only been able to watch it once audrey hepburn is my favorite all time actor actress and she \( joanna in this \) is brilliant as always however albert finney 's roll \( mark \) charactor and performance is in stark contrast the further the movie goes the more i disliked mark and was angry that joanna was putting up with him mark 's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable five stars audrey minus four albert	11
0	i have not seen this movie but thanks to the review of a viewer from july 2001 i do n't have to	11
1	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert granted they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim this is truly a broadway event the documentary which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	11
0	the ones that are posted twice do not work if they are posted once you can try to download it but it might not work the video only worked for about a minute shame since i really like this show and i wanted amazon unbox to be cool the one cent csi works go download tha	11
0	oh please whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette' do so and make it available on dvd this was one of the finest shows ever created for television truly it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now 40 years later i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd for the sake of one of the theater \( and humanity 's \) most glorious theatrical efforts please make the original tv version available ! \( btw i rate the original item at 5 stars !	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11
1	this is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject the clips of ginsberg amp burroughs are especially effective the celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself amp not just empty theatrics the beats are still a source to return to for inspiration amp insight the world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now of course there 's more but this video gives you enough to get you started amp gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late	11
1	i purchased the dvd for my adopted chinese grandaughter the whole family loves it	11
0	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it did n't play anyway i gave up	11
0	i watched this movie seeing that it was a shark movie but where 's the shark \? \? the plot is these people are hostages the shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie but i was watching going okay they 're in the water where is the shark \? \? \? even jaws 3 \( which sucked \) has more sharks if you like hoatage movies see this \( on second thought do n't \) but if you like sharks see something else	11
0	this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire good snowboarding stunts and the cast is great sawa looks a little scruffy looking like i said with the snowboarding and action dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon	11
0	i wish i had read the other reviews first though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch the episode cuts off after 22 minutes obviously i already know the ending of the black death but i still wanted to see the full show	11
0	i was so excited to buy my son a potty seat he is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months he picked out the pooh and loved it and i love the splash guard unfortunately the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor he is not leaning over to the floor the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor this seat is quite tipsy	12
0	if you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you but just try turning and especially sharp turns you 'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way	12
1	i do n't have twins however i have an infant and a toddler and it worksgreat for them i go jogging every morning with the kids andit is the most comfortable stroller i have used yet thank you ! !	12
0	if i could rate it no stars i would let me tell you that my son is now 8 and is perfectly normal especially as a baby but i 'll tell you what you don't need a microwave technically they are dangerous for the fomula the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it hard shake then your all set it 's that easy do n't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula	12
1	this product works well with my dr brown 's bottles there are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks i use a sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it wo n't scratch the bottles though the sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	12
0	i bought the avent breastshells because of my sore nipples and a way to collect leaking milk while i was not nursing and relieve some engorment 1 it is very messy when removing the colleting cap2 my nipples are still sore3 and the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pumpif i would have known about these factors i would not have purchased this product	12
0	i really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in however the quality of the material is less than desirable the cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier i expected some shrinkage but it seems excessive i still use the covers but am disappointed overall the material is not very soft so admittedly i will look around for other products	12
1	have used these bibs for two kids now wow do they last and unlike some bibs these can go right in the washer and dryer well worth the money ! still using them for my messy 3 year old	12
0	this piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces the directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle ! but the actual parts are n't labeled so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean when finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable also as many of the holes are not lined up so i could n't even put in some of the bolts	12
0	the freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea but the plastic is very flimsy and when set in place it just barely reaches the floor it 's a pretty unstable situation a separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better	12
0	i thought i 'd try this monitor since it was a 900mhz and had a far range well i have problems similar to sara 's when i used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps i would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used when there was no beeping or loss of signal it 's reception was clear that 's why i gave it a 2nd star this product is going back to the store tomorrow and i will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	12
0	before i even had the opportunity to use this product it has disappointed me i have washed this item per the manufacturer 's instructions the bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled i wonder how many more washings this pad can stand truly a disappointment	12
0	you do n't want this one although the fabric is appealing \( calm stripes vs the buzy themes of the other covers \) this cover will not fit most shopping carts it only fits the carts found at small city super markets if you are a suburbian shopper you 'll have to spend the bucks for a more satisfactory product	12
1	i used this with my third child i washed it over and over and always the stains came right out it 's so soft ! ! ! ! definitely a good buy	12
1	this pillow works ! sleeping in the car used to make my son crankybecausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss cry now with this comfy pillow he naps peacefully wakes up happy	12
1	it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks i have searched the web and ca n't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing does n't look quite as good with a brush that does n't match	12
0	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in but really it took up too much counter space i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary i found save your money	12
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	12
0	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive well i learned my lessen you get what you pay for like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw if you will closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie i hope this will work out much better	12
0	i never got to use this sheet i pre washed it and put it to dry on low heat as i 've done with all the baby clothes i later saw the label said to air dry which seems ridiculous for something that 'll be washed so often anyway it shrunk and does n't fit over the co sleeper mattress if you have time space to air dry it it 's probably a fine product	12
1	my husband and i just had a wonderful baby girl \( apr 9 2007 \) and i simply could not live without this item my daughter loves sleeping in it it is light therefore it can be easily moved from one room to another as needed you could easily travel with it from hotels to the grandparents house it can be folded compactly and easily stored and there is also a handle for carrying the light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co sleep as well obviously do not leave your child unsupervised in it ! it is excellent and i highly recommend it to all parents	12
1	my boys love them they draw in the car and their cup can sit on it kinda a pain for short drives but wonderful for longer trips	12
0	i bought this bundle me in nov and it did not even last 2 5 months the zipper broke it is not well made stick with the other bundle mes the urban bundle me is cheaply made not worth the pric	12
0	i love the idea of this product like many of the other reviewer 's i do n't have the regular traditional style crib our crib converts to a toddler bed this product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs i would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one 's that are more with the current styles of cribs like mine 's	12
0	even though i think this is a very good idea \( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand alone potty \) the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well we have the oblong seats not the round ones and the ring slides back and forth especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it it does n't make her feel very stable so so far at least she has refused to use it	12
0	i bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old i ended up returning it 3 days later i am a petite woman \( 5'2 \) and this item was totally uncomfortable ! i still have bruises under my arms from this item i followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual it bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits i would not reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as i am not worth the mone	12
0	i'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump now i'm looking for another one it 's difficult to pump if you have large nipples you have to buy extra sheild which costs extra it 's noisy it loses suction the milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy i clean the parts everyday i have contacted medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor \( great customer service \) it worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening i guess it works for some and not others now i'm in the hunt for another pump since i want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year	12
0	i bought this product for childproofing purposes i was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer 's instructions state not to install gate against drywall \( which was not in the item description \) so i cannot use it where i needed it also the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close especially with a small child in your arms	12
0	i did n't even get to use this pad it fell apart in the washer the first time i washed it the vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle \? \? \? \? \? \? what 's up with that \? what good is it to have a mattress pad that you ca n't wash \? total waste of money i am taking it back today ! !	12
1	i highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born if you plan on breastfeeding i was very sore in the first few weeks the shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings i did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks but they got me through those weeks when i do n't know if i 'd have made it otherwise ! they were a wonderful product for me	12
0	i received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is i have a large baby he was almost 17 lbs at four months old so his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age he also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs he did n't seem very happy in it it may work better if you have a smaller baby but the chubbier ones will never fit for long	12
1	i just received my travel set today and i already love it ! the bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle i have the pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house i highly recommend it	12
1	i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so i am reporting what they said about it great	12
0	i have 2 wipes warmers one for upstairs and one for downstairs at one point i had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work mine took forever to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section same as previous reviews the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly i have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine do not waste your money on the munchkin warmer	12
1	i have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age we love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry just make sure the suction cup is wet and it wo n't fall off the wall sizewize it 's basically a perfect fit in our tub which is slightly tapered from head to toe but i could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub	12
1	i got this system for my 18 mo old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was stuck they have helped prevent him from doing that any more however if he 's in the mood he can easily dismantle the entire contraption so it wo n't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to in fact the two end panels had to be removed because he would n't leave them alone all in all though i think the mesh bumpers do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys \( and pluggers \) in the crib instead of out on the floor	12
0	if you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation this item is not for you since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her she was bored to tears \( literally \) every time we put her in the lounger \( the baby faces the ceiling not too exciting \) i thought it was a cool concept however my daughter did not she did much better in her papasan or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to but have the option to look around and play as well looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter	12
1	this gate us a lifesaver not only do i pets i have a very adventurus toddler this gate is sturdy and very durable it is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight my living room has a curve to it so it fits great a wonderful item thank you	12
0	i have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her i will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck	12
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries waste of money !	12
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
1	i had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before needless to say fabric does n't protect leather very well i ended up with deep depressions in the leather hopefully the leather will go back \( fingers crossed \) the firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up and both of the carseats are as secure as ever i have the rear and forward facing models	12
0	these bowls are not worth the money they do not stay on the table at all !	12
0	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat	12
1	this is a good quality item for the money i love that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets i just bought a second one for grandma 's house !	12
0	the swing was easy to install and i did not need extra tools or help unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal it was even enough however and i put my daughter in the swing was tilting a little far forward but i could not adjust it the worst part was getting her out the tray was near impossible to undo from its locked position i guess i did not need to worry about her falling out i was just wondering if i would be able to get her out at all i 'll be donating the swing	12
1	it is a little costy but worth the money it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover its size is large enough to last many years	12
0	the maternity support did n't stay in place it kept bunching up in one spot and did n't help my back at all ! i would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product	12
1	this mobile is amazing from the time she was 6 weeks old my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music she loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile although it can be noisy it does n't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds a must for any nursery	12
0	i ordered a kidco elongated child gate a recommended extension needed to be purchased the wrong extension was sent i needed g24 model and received 24 extension for a different model	12
1	finally ! ! ! i am a stickler for matching things with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but i love having the matching hat for my december baby i know she 's warm	12
0	even though it comes with instructions it is way too complicated to use i was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing not to mention it shrunk 2 feet after i washed it \( following the instructions mind you \) now i have to tighten it in the back versus the front it 's now destined for the donation pile the baby bjorn is easier to use	12
1	good baby monitor overall sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and i ca n't find where the interference is coming from	12
1	i bought this as a gift ca n't give much opinion she told me she loved them so i give it 5 stars maybe that 's not a fair review but it 's breast pads they are always useful ! lo	12
1	i have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs the gates are attached to the walls i have not had any problems with the either gate for those of you searching for a gate for a dog the gate works will with by 70 pound boxer	12
1	my daughter is just learning how to self feed and these placemats are great i 've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are this product solves that problem the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off however i do not find this to be a major problem also i tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table great tip thanks this is a great product for kids learning to eat	12
0	do not order this item ! i ordered and returned this item four times due to cracked pieces storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage i refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture what a disaster and diappointment	12
0	i was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes the ad said universal fit well it fit but second size up car seats are taller and kind of lean back when you attach the canopy it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun a hat better serves my child then this aparatus it now sits in the garage with all the other failed baby devices	12
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	12
0	i bought this for my son who was just over 2 years old at the time within about 9 or 10 months the railing broke at the plastic hinge obviously since this is major stress point for the product it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue i was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	12
0	i will not buy these again they are tiny thick and do not tapper on the edges this means you will see the lines thru your shirts the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela they cover more are thinner and stick better	12
0	i purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes it impossible to close with one hand even if you do n't care about the one hand feature it is still a hassle to adjust i do not suggest buying this gate	12
0	i purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so i have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units the sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that i would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them	12
0	do n't waste your money on this high chair by the time your infant can safely sit in it they will have almost outgrown it you 're just paying for the name brand not the quality stick w a graco instead	12
0	we received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago \( i was registered at babies r us \) my first child used it for a little over 2 years my second child has used it for nearly 2 years neither child is big \( in fact one is rather petite \) even though the mattress was not abused it cracked and ripped in numerous places i'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from kolkraft i do n't recommend this mattress	12
0	this is by far the worst sling i have ever tried ! the padding is bulky and hot it is impossible to adjust total waste of money i bought a pouch from www equanimitybaby com and it was perfect ! easy to use and very comfy the bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk if you ca n't use this sling its not you its the sling	12
1	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
0	overpriced ! not what i expected ! you ca n't really used it because it 's too small for big bellied pregnant women ! uncomfortable ! the velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy yuck	12
0	i have small hands so i actually ca n't grip this product with one hand it slips right out because there is no hole the items are okay really do n't like the nail cutters though and they do n't stay in there places i'm sure there are better kits out there	12
1	i love this shade ! i am the mother of 2 girls alice 7 and samantha 22 months i never had anything like this for my oldest it makes such a difference the little one wo n't go out without it ! even though i always used sunblock on alice her skin is still so much darker than samantha 's i really believe it is because of the shade i looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and i think it is the best one on the market the others are made from nylon lycra and i do n't think that would hold up as well as this one does thank you protect a bub	12
1	this is my third child and third infant car seat this was the most expensive but worth the money the padding keeps the baby 's head from that scary 90 degree flop the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids the straps do n't get twisted and it 's much easier to get in and out of the car it 's the same weight as the others \( which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry \) the only thing i do n't like is it does not fit on shopping carts worth the money	12
0	i 've heard avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself i just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and both link not just a littler either but with every use my daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases i find this odd b c the 6mths cups do n't link at all i think these products are very hit or miss you may get a leaky cup or you they may work great \?	12
0	i had been told that these were wonderful to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back but my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides this worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach	12
0	i'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo old son weighs 28 lbs and should be able to stay in it for alot longer \( up to 40 lbs \) the straps are let all the way out and it 's still too tight for him i would n't recommend this car seat for chunky babies	12

0	i was so excited when i recieved this humidifier at my baby shower but after several tries i finally returned it this product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically well the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on my baby wakes up crying ! ! ! note that i live 2 miles from an airforce base and the planes do n't even wake her ! ! ! ! do n't buy this product	12
1	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby i'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold very good quality product	12
1	this is the best potty seat that you can buy it 's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard also i love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall	12
1	i do n't know what the reviewers before me were talking about i use this at kroger giant eagle and target and do n't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store it 's sturdy and easy to use do n't pass this one up	12
0	these are a complete waste of money the nipples flow too fast for a newborn i tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding she also swallowed so much air i was burping her for what seemed hours the bottles are too expensive for just storage you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for 3 99 personally i like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer they take up less space	12
1	we bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats he was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly could n't handle the full size version this tub is a perfect in between option the only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub	12
1	the only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty otherwise they work really good tara boyc	12
0	the breathe safe padded sheet also left a mesh imprint on my baby 's face placing a sheet over the breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine 1 \) untying bumper guard moving it out of the way2 \) struggling to pull out heavy mattress from crib3 \) removing washing sheet mattress pad4 \) wiping off mattress with soap water5 \) replacing sheet mattress pad6 \) returning heavy mattress to crib7 \) re arranging dust ruffle8 \) re tying bumper guardother than that it seemed like a good idea searching for a better product	12
0	with the rear facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan this mirror limits driver visability when the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror a large section of the back windshield is blocked i'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror	12
1	these bibs are the best my son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out when meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch must have for any new parent	12
0	the quality of this swaddle blanket is very good i'm not complaining about that the problem we 've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks this triggers his newborn rooting instinct which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger i recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item we own two of them and they keep our baby very cozy and warm	12
0	well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it so she decided not to sell it to me so i never got this car seat i really do n't understand why i need to write a review on it	12
0	i was really hopeful about this diaper bag when i ordered it through amazon the size is small and convenient but i found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck also the clasp broke after i had it for only 2 weeks ! i am really disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag	12
1	i installed this today though i have n't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy i was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo but after getting it and installing it it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me it also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat i'm giving the chair five stars because i ca n't think of anything negative about it	12
1	we were downstairs one night watching tv and kept hearing crickets turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor this thing is so good i can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up there is no doubt i can hear anything my daughter needs i can tell from her cry through the monitor whether i need to prep or bottle get a diaper ready or its time for play	12
0	i thought that these would be great but could never get them to work right sometimes they would flow sometimes not i would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over to many pieces to much trouble i would be upset and my baby would be also ! switched to avent and loving it	12
0	i bought this potty seat for my daughter and i took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets the second i put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet ! the seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets that is a lie my toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through a waste of money and a safety hazard	12

1	lightweight high quality construction we are very pleased with it and our 1 5yr girl just loves it the carrying strap is a very convenient addition do n't waste your money on a 20 umbrella stroller spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller	12
1	after months of sleeplessness i received this pillow as a gift from my mom it is wonderful but not for the reasons i thought i thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins \( which it is \) but the real relief is that i barely wake up as i flip from one side to the other since it is nicely wedged between my knees	12
0	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin i wo n't ever use it again	12

1	i originally bought this bag for a trip to disney world it held everything great stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack although i was not using it to carry children 's gear i carried an umbrella 3 bottles of water granola bars sun glasses cellphone keys wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great ! i am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far	12
0	this was way too quiet even on it 's loudest setting my infant did n't benefit from it at all the sounds are fine and not too repetative as with some machines but even in a small room \( really small \) i found it too quiet to be effective	12
0	i was very excited to try out this tent at the beach we got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him one of the supports had broken it was the first time i 'd used it i was very disappointed	12
0	buy the baby bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk no matter how i tried i could n't wrap my baby to where i felt he was secure and safe and comfortable plus it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me by the time he was in he wanted out	12

1	my 6 month old got these for christmas they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg but it broke i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	12
0	i bought this for an older model graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it the mattress measures 27 x 39 and before washing it my husband and i tried it out to see if it fit it 's too small i know it 's supposed to be snug but the mattress wo n't even lay flat with this sheet on it it seems like it 'd be a great product if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly	12
1	my boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it it 's fun and it 's a miniature size adult potty they love it the seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already but we are making it work we have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger	12
0	this seemed like the original johnny jump up i had for my first child 13 years ago we loved that one so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it did n't work very well it just did n't seem as springy as it should be i ended up returning it and getting the 40 version with the tray instead \( the jump go \) people have complained about the tray pinching baby 's fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier also our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot	12
1	we just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters they 're great they 're strong enough to keep our 11 month old baby from falling through we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened i still intend to watch him carefully when he 's up there but these will definitely protect him in an emergency just be sure to follow directions tie them tightly ! ! they 're not that bad looks wise either i can still see my spindles through the netting so the look of the stairway is basically unchanged of course looks are less important than safety ! i think i'm going to get these for our outdoor deck as well i 'd recommend them	12
1	when i had my daughter i had no clue where to begin with breast pads so i bought several different types a friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite i wish i had never wasted money on the other pads i did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands it was worth it because they were so much more comfortable i did n't have any chaffing like with most others also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive	12
1	i was given a swaddle me for my third child she has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks my oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not i owe it all to the swaddle me but at three months she outgrew the small size i thought she was old enough to go without swaddling boy was i wrong it took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size i have had my large swaddle me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then thank you swaddle me for helping me keep my sanity	12
1	i have used many infant tubs and i love this one ! it folds so nicely i keep it in the kitchen pantry it fits in the sink and i keep the faucet running like a little shower and i can rinse her with fresh water i actually think the angle is great for an infant but with a newborn i use one of those yellow bear sponges in the tub for extra support \( but i use one with all the infant tubs i have used \)	12
0	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas when they 're using the bottle you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips every time my little girl uses them it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them i would recommend dr brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these ultimately the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause	12
1	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often at just 14 months she could jump with both feet off the ground it is a quality product at a reasonable price would highly recommend	12
0	we ordered a tub from baby because which was delivered then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered on route the formula fell off a ups truck and was lying in the street for over a day a neighbor saw it and gave it to us baby because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it we expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day they said it was n't our concern and to just give it back	12

1	my daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out then we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic amen ! i do n't care how many parts there are it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting	12
1	i purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old at first he seemed a little intimidated by the toys and would cry when i put him in it once he got used to it he really enjoyed it now he plays with all the toys and he likes that it wobbles around his favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads i did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about just lucky i guess the seat is really hard to remove for washing which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of	12

1	i have no idea how our parents had us with out these ! they are the best invention ! my son likes to play with plates so i can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating i have a toddler and a 9 mo old neither of them have been able to remove these things and beleive me they 've tried so i dont know what that other review was talking about they 're inexpensive easy to use and clean	12
0	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies i bought a starter kit and several other bottles i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid nothing helped my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them i switched to another brand and now we are very dry	12

1	i had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an avent bottle \( which my first took beautifully \) so i called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice they suggested the evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple they worked great after swearing by avent with my first i never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an old fashioned type bottle it works though so i will stick with them	12

0	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week the prima pappa is comfortable and secure in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles	12
0	this wipe warmer is more trouble than it 's worth the water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table as a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes i emailed the manufacturer regarding this product to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective they failed to respond	12
0	do not buy this mattress it is not safe this mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins when i called kolcraft to inform them the cs rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit and that they have n't had any complaints she also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size we have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug the kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily	12

1	my daughter received this as a gift from mommy when she was about 3 1 2 months at first she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face but if you take off a ring take it higher your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy the only complaint i have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child the mirror distorts your child 's vision so i took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it ! my daughter loves it she could be eating her breakfast or sitting in her swing and all she 'll do is stare at her playmat ! a definite must for all parents	12
1	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front i broke down and bought this this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty but it 's beauty is its simplicity he is able to sit and do his business carry the urine poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself \( he was not even 2 yet ! \) i would highly recommed the potty training book potty training in less than a day it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on	12
0	we have the graco ultra clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years with a new baby on the way we thought we 'd upgrade to the new technology oops it turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the ultra clear \( could n't even make it to the other side of the house \) and the reception was quite poor and the annoying beeping was the clincher i sent it back today and bought another 40 ultra clear oh and i tried the fisher price private connection also and had the same issues	12
1	we are using this bather for our son who is one month old what we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby the fabric is also very soft quick drying and removable for machine washing the model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby 's waist to keep him warm we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath since we do n't fill up the tub with water slippage has not been a problem	12

1	i ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality softness of the fabrics it 's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy i have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed so what i did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition i also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa i have in the room	12
1	well made and well priced your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart buy buy bu	12
0	my baby slid both down and off the side of this i thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base rather it acted as a swivel and i found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner i am involved in a sids research study and this product alarms me ! she could have suffocated ! i am trying to contact the company to report this item please do not buy	12
0	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago a week ago it just stopped working i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore so i went out and bought the exact same steamer i used it for 2 days and then on the third day yesterday it would n't turn on anymore i'm taking it back today and getting something else	12
0	i did n't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out and it does take standard garbage bags after a few months of use the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off i assembled it back together and within a few days the spring broke in half i tried to get another spring by calling safety first they only had the blue top without the spring the guy said i 'd just have to buy another pail if i wanted a working pop top	12
0	does n't dry your bottles at all it leave a condensation and does n't dry completely i give it one star for all the stuff it holds but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it	12
1	this monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night i test it frequently and it works there has never been a false alarm \( everyone warned me i would lose my mind if it went off by accident it has n't \) the only drawback the channel is not so clear there is static when you listen to it but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny \( i have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when i just want to monitor noise during the day but i would not have another monitor for his bedroom	12
0	i thought i would love this but just returned it it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time \( 10 minutes \? \) maybe i'm too small \( 5'2 \) or my baby \( 5 months and 18 pounds \) is too large either way i still find the bjorn much more comfortable i would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the bjorn but i could n't stand wearing ! very painful	12
0	i received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter i thought it was a wonderful toy and so did my daughter after playing a while with it on the floor my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands and fell down and the toy dropped on the floor at this point the toy started to malfunction the music would play sometimes and not others and after being dropped to the floor a couple more times it stopped working altogether i think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be great toy but it did n't last long	12
0	i was really unhappy with this lock it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	12
0	this product is a mess i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50 down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun	12
0	we love this monitor but only when it does not have awful interference unfortunately in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours we do not live in an apartment or townhouse \( which i read was not recommended for this product \) but we do have wireless internet only we are n't using it when there is static so who knows i love being able to see my boy but the static makes the monitor really annoying	12
0	i did n't like these for a few reasons they take up too much room in my freezer they take too long to thaw i do n't care for the avent isis pump i have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and i can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker	12
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone we just love it and so does our 6 month old	12
1	there are two types of dekor refill one regular and one 'plus' the sizes are different and you better be sure to order the right one	12
0	i bought this pump because it had the medela name and i thought it was reliable i was wrong this is the worst pump in the world everything the other poster said is true this is the worst breastpump i would not recommend this breastpump to anyone	12
0	i thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that i have clean nipples for my baby unfortunately when you read the instructions for most latex nipples they are n't dishwasher safe and you are instructed to hand wash so having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless i use mine as a container that i can airdry my handwashed nipples in do n't waste your money	12
1	i really like this i have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess i think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what my bottles fit just fine i use the avent bottles	12
0	well we ordered this for a trip and it 's delayed even though it says it 's in stock we got a vauge email that says delayed but no promise of delivery do n't order it from amazon if you 're exhausted chasing an escaping baby ! go to a local store and purchase it waiting waiting waiting	12
1	this is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it i am very pleased with the purchas	12
1	this seat is wonderful my daughter ca n't quite sit on her own yet but this keeps her secure and comfortable make sure you loop the belt around your child and the cart or high chair this seat is small and very easy to use it 's a great product	12
1	it works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it ! ! sometimes there is a little interference but if you just move the monitor \( sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference \) it will work great ! we have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again ! ! the night vision works great even in our son 's dark room the color is great as long as there is sufficient light	12
0	i recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide within one week of use the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable i am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type this gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for	12
0	its a great price but its very small its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small there 's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it	12
1	love these i use them everywhere i really ca n't imagine not having them since my son throws down all plates and napkins still	12
1	i really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good the only thing i don acute t like is the way the strings work there are not enough and also they rip off easily not stitched well for the price generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed also suffication could be a problem we have bought a convertable crib \( common in europe \) which can be used till approx age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later anyhow we still love it it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari	12
0	lucky for me i didn't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps what a waste of time you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked	12
1	we bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly this one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again i also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean	12
1	i definately recommend this product i used it every day for my baby for the first 9 months great both indoors and outdoors !	12
1	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool it has rechargeable batteries image and sound are clear enough night vision works perfect monitor is not bulky at all \( no color at all though \) and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us	12
0	did not work at all ! had to return it ! we prefer the tinkle toons potty with a moisture sensor the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work	12
1	this is a great organizer i read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until i received this one it is great ! we use the avent bottles and they and all of their parts fit very well there are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers it did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter but once we mastered that all is well	12
1	i like this car seat it is very soft for a bab	12
1	finally a cute pink car seat it is duralble and easy to lift around i wish they had this cute color for my other daughter ihave not deliverd yet so i do n't know how she will fit in it but i also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is there is not any other pink combo out there i just hope it works as well as it shows off	12
0	do n't bother with these they are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary it is much easier to buy storage bags if you are pumping full time you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time i also found that i did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby 's belly and the result is gas or worse colic they also flow too fast for newborns	12
1	the mom who received this gift was very pleased with it	12
1	this has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk formula and now baby food jars it heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it i wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child i think that this is a very good investment especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it does n't heat anything evenly ! !	12
1	easiest purchase just love the crib and the price was unbelievable including shipping cost	12
1	i received this as a baby shower gift from my mom and love it ! it is so easy to manuever you can do it with one hand the stroller has ample space for bags purse etc below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items the drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus the material is so pretty and the colors are great the best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather i would highly recommend this item	12
0	this is o k if you 're using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	12
0	unfortunately despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway i have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards it was not sturdy at all returned it	12
0	hi i bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension i was so wrong ! if your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure there are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either i ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub but i have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it it has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play so if you are searching for a bath seat i dont recommend the safety 1st at all	12
1	they 're a little pricey but they work great they are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make	12
1	if you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow ! ! ! they are awesome and easy you can wash them they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere love it ! ! !	12
1	i purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training i like that the top has a non slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet she really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training	12
0	they are messy when they opened i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much i do n't have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it 's like 17 for ten	12
0	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep but it did n't work worst yet her head would slide off the edge i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around	12
0	i do not like these bags the twist tie closure system is cumbersome the bags are small the plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen the only advantage i can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly	12
0	this stroller is way to heavy too long steering is very difficult and too bulky it is huge when folded try something else	12
1	this product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home while others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes i found that i could keep it velcro 'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom my daughter really liked this but quickly outgrew it at just one month old she did n't want her arms tied down so the usefullness of the product is limited for a baby who loves being swaddled this is an indispensible item i 'll pass mine on with our hand me downs you never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled	12
1	this crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it 's way great customer service the quality of the bed is outstanding we purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes	12
1	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly and i do not miss that i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry it has always worked well and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately the picture is clear the sound is excellent you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in but the cords are all generous in length we would go nuts without it	12
1	the armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because i was expecting something else i still like it very much but i wanted a part to hang clothes and it does n't have one it is very pretty and from the outside it was everything i was expecting ! ! ! thank you	12
0	if your baby has fingers or teeth this is not a trap they can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee	12
1	put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo	12
1	such a great product for my baby she loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time it builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together the plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands such a winne	12
1	what a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter when my son wants me to play a game puzzle or play on the floor i just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time i have also found it helpful when i fold laundry i can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what i am doing it props the baby 's head up just enough better than just laying flat on the floor the lounger also cradles the baby i wish that i had found this when my son was a baby i recomend this lounger to every new mommy	12
1	i read some other reviews that were poor but i disagree my son loves this toy he smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room it plays music continually for 12 minutes so in the middle of the night when he wakes up i turn it on and he 's asleep by the time it runs out we have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy however it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees this completely contradicts the interactive play mode since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons	12
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
1	this was a gift and in shopping for a pack n play it seemed the best value for the price	12
1	this jogger is great i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo	12
1	i was that parent who said i 'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer and then i woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who does n't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me i am now a big fan of the warmer it works very quickly and does n't dry them out and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up definately a nice product	12
1	the floppy seat is a great item no more worrying about baby 's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs i recommend this to all new moms and give it an a	12
1	i bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers with the touch of one button i can keep track of how long it has been since i fed my baby i do n't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone the first unit i was sent was defective and i received terrific customer service when i contacted the company i am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because i 'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well maybe a future model	12
1	we registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby upon receiving it as a shower gift i knew this was going to be great i love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in it 's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag this is a must have for every new parent	12
0	i used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since i'm engorged and found out the motor is broken i'm very disappointed since i trusted the medela name if i could afford it i 'd replace it with the pump in style but unfortunately i 'll have to try a manual pump	12
0	i bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born it is awful ! it gives strange readings like 94 5 and 95 1 when in fact i know that she has a fever ! i bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings do n't buy this its a waste of time and	12
1	i found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two year old easier she loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked the security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x ray machine	12
1	i bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features overall i am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it but few things i wish it had is one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention overall for the price it is good	12
0	my son is ten days old i tried these bottles and was highly disappointed the liners are a pain in the butt once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again i changed to dr brown 's bottles and my son is having less gas and is n't wearing his food	12
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we	12
1	i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased it works great for my new pomeranian puppies the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it i feel the gate is great for animals i have not used it with children as of this time	12
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces it is also more stable than others we used we like it	12
1	this is the bmw of all highchairs it 's super sturdy and the italian leather seat is easy to care for ignore the reviews about being a pain to clean you need to clean every highchair nooks crannies and all	12
1	this is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks i had more leaks with disposables we are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes i am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth and delighted with the ease of use of this product	12
1	i 've had the hippo faucet cover for over six months and i think it 's great ! my son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt it is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise i think it 's worth it ! the only problem i found with the hippo cover is that it does n't really dispense bubble bath well	12
1	i used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place it works great ! her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better which is a plus	12
1	as i am not personally using this i can only pass on what i have been told it does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away	12
0	this sheet is cheap ugly and scratchy instead buy a portable crib sheet they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors they are softer and more durable	12
0	i should have read the reviews i purchased this item and it quit working after a week of normal use	12
1	this seems to be a secure seat and our almost 5 year old is comfortable in it the buckling system is a bit inconvenient you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped i wish our son could buckle himself in at this point but this seat makes it too hard it 's also not a seat you want to do air travel with as it 's unwieldy to carry around but all in all i would say it 's a good purchase	12
1	i have two children now and i wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born i have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car and nothing worked 100 of the time this however does it is one of the best things i have ever purchased for my child and it 's very inexpensive	12
0	i hate hate hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy	12
0	i would not recommend this crib mattress pad i followed the washing instructions prior to first use and the pad would not fit on the mattress when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore luckily amazon took it back	12
1	i buy a lot of stuff from amazon this bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as i bought it the price reduced on amazon this had been a constant problem on amazon and i think somebody should do something about it i think i should get a refund \) thanks shobhn	12
0	the item is sloppy looking and feeling unlike the photo of the black ellaroo i did n't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip maybe i just never got it adjusted correctly but i read the instructions and gave it many tries however on a positive note i was refunded my money with no problem there was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front so i have no problem with the seller	12
0	my 8 1 2 mo granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night i 've got the correct bumper pads etc but babies do move she had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset i 've only had the crib 1 week she 's gotten her leg stuck 2 times we caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer	12
0	this item is packaged horribly if you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price received changing hutch and tower crib and toybox intact very happy ordered this dresser twice both times damaged good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6 8 plus weeks my suggestion is to order two dressers take the best pieces from each and return the rest believe me you will be glad you did	12
1	my granddaughter is one year old she absolutly loves her new walker she is small for her age so the adjustable height is perfect	12
0	tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed ihave a product from nano bags that beats this one in construction and comfort this was nice only received as a gift but nothing more washed poorly disappointed	12
1	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer for the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting anyway i'm just writing the review to offset the bad review there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they 're supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table	12
1	this is such a great idea i just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib we can make our own	12
0	i unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift did not use one with our first child i got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before i decided to return it you literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir which slides on has no rubber seal or other watertight implements can leak everywhere judging by the other comments i'm glad it leaked before i had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes	12
0	the design is pretty narrow my 3 4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described the product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry unless you have a very small and quiet baby otherwise it is not a wise choice	12
1	i had one of these with my second son and loved it we just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary when it was hot out we could uncover him and when we went into somewhere with air conditioning we would just cover him up it is soft and cozy we found it so convenient we will be purchasing another one for number three who 's due in may	12
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile possibly injuring or killing your child do not buy !	12
0	i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it i find it a nightmare ! if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out it does not work when on the charger it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts what a piece of junk i would in no way recommend this product to anyone	12
1	i absolutely love this walker the songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained i also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere there are also great safety features such as the grip strips on the bottom the wheels are very easily manuevered also i would definitely recommend this product to other moms	12
0	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	12
0	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same other covers i 've seen just slip on this one has to be tied on also it does n't cover the entire cart there is an opening that my baby 's fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle not a great product spend the extra money and buy the better one	12
0	this seat is very dangerous and set my daughter 's potty training back months the seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it ! thank goodness i was still holding her ! she did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after ! potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse ! the only reason i gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one	12
1	it 's kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad it gets the job done it folds rather compactly i think it 's well worth the money	12
1	i wish that it would zip up all the way the top is coming down all the time and i have to adjusted maybe it 's better for a two and up age child	12
0	these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing ! i bought two of these one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside i constantly have to cut the strings \(	12
1	we have n't used this set yet because our baby is due in june but have set it up in our crib the fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking the bumper fits well in our crib and the tags say all the fabrics are 100 cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100 polyester we are very happy with this set for our future little girl	12
0	i bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the tear resistant cover material all she does is sleep on it !	12
1	i love this sack and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !	12
0	the item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve i ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completleydifferent diaper these are thicker better quality and have blue stitching and gerber stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers the diapers i got were thinner plain white and had no stamp buyer beware ! you will not get what you see in this current photo	12
1	i have been very impressed with every avent product that i have purchased i have found these pacifiers to be so nice they are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them my baby loves hers we ca n't live without them	12
1	i bought this sheet for my graco pack n' play and it fits great it 's very soft and looks great wash after wash	12
1	i think this product is fantastic the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing the timer is also a nice feature this is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby the sheep is cute and surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it 's tummy	12
1	i love the 5 point harness my daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt this seat was easy to install and we love it	12
1	the first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep \( need i say anymore \) \? it fits nearly every shopping cart it 's easy to fold and unfold and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs are n't coming home with us ! well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me	12
0	i bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet we have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar it is not ! it has not fit on any public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place she does n't want to use it which leaves me with nothing ! i would not purchase this product	12
0	rather than this sling i recommend you check out for your sling they are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors this is a far better buy than the native baby carrier	12
0	we had better luck than some the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out called customer service and they said it is n't a replaceable part too bad it was easy enough to install and worked well up until it did n't anymore the click is pretty loud we found ourselves trying to close it two handed to avoid waking up the baby disappointed it did n't last as long as we needed a gate but my daughter is only 2 1 2 and i still need a gate at the top of the stairs i'l be replacing it with a different product obviously	12
1	this backless booster is a simple last step booster bottom for kids who are ready to buckle themselves and like to change where they sit and are old big enough to know their part the booster is light but well made its use is super easy but the one piece arms help giude the passive restraint seat belts the fun color was a good bonus	12
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12
1	we like this stroller it seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability \( shoulder strap \) make it ideal for trips especially in airports my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall \( 6'4 \) but it is fine for me \( 5'3 \) we like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice overall a good stroller for the price	12
1	these bags work fine in the dekor diaper pail it would probably be easier if you could just buy trash bags from the store instead of special ordering them but i am borrowing this diaper pail so these are the bags that it uses they do work great keep the smell inside etc if you order be sure if you need regular or dekor plus diaper bags there is a difference in the size of the bags	12
0	i bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay my son pees over the top of this plus it being on is n't to comfortable for an adult 's back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often the whole on it is also pretty small	12
0	this thermometer is totally worthless it does n't read the correct temp on myself husband or baby when my little one was sick at 3 months old this thing read 96 7 degrees on all three of us i picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm works great cost me 3 i ca n't give this one away	12
1	this a wonderful stroller i have a large 35lb 2yr old and he is very comfortable great folding mechanism folding is easy and i can do it with one hand nice pockets for storage	12
1	used this for double stroller while on vacation in hershey park fantastic ! easy to put on easy to store ! i do n't know why strollers especially doubles have such dinky canopies anyway ! but this did it 's duty	12
1	i bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind which i love come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often you really are supposed to do that because otherwise you will get an breast infection especially if you live in the south where it 's warm and humid i recommend the ultra thin pads the other ones that come in the variety pack are just ok	12
0	we got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock but lo and behold it only lasted a week our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib so when he kicked this the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib where it could have posed a choking hazard ! pass on this and get a fisher price one ocean wonders or the one we got flutterbye dreams which he loves	12
1	i purchased this item \( not from amazon \) and my child loved it ! the puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great not the usual 'kid drivel' that usually is part of any kid item some hbb 's come with contemporary music and i will be picking up one of those soon highly recommended	12
1	i loved having this easy swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart the velcro worked really well as it gave room to grow swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two she just totally outgrew this it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift	12
0	we had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son boy were we wrong the first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart so we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again he only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50 i would definitely not recommend this to anyone	12
0	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose if you use these mats the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents don't buy !	12
1	i brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet the suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet i going to buy more for my other room	12
1	as im sure all mothers can relate my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart i looked at a lot of local stores for a cover i couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt 80 this one is great ! its reasonably priced wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts ! !	12
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
0	i am returning my roxy safe seat ! it was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door the material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat at a grocery store the seat just fits into the whole cart and i have no room for groceries its not worth the hastle i admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy the seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place sorry graco the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	12
1	the crib tent is great ! we originally got it to keep our cats out but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too \) until at 27 months he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper ! ! ! ! o so now we 're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week ! it is hard to change sheets with the crib tent but just get the ultimate crib sheet it 's a piece of cake ! \) also it is possible to put down the side rail of the crib but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head	12
1	she really enjoyed tummy time on this mat loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab	12
1	this doll is attractive does everything it is supposed to do comes with appropriate accessories and above all children love it appears to be well made with a soft cuddly body and our 6 year old granddaughter loves it	12
1	if you have an ipod or mp3 player i 'd recommend getting this i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week and tested it out \( our baby has n't been born yet \) the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo and i'm 1 2 deaf i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color my only criticism is that it takes batteries \( no ac adapter \) we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly for 20 i think it 's great	12
0	i heard lots about the avent brand while pregnant and registered for all avent bottles boy am i glad that someone gave me soothies and parent 's choice anti colic bottles too ! ! the nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them she loves the other two brands and i love the parent 's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot do n't waste time or money with avent !	12
1	i was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib nothing was inside except the sheets and baby as you can imagine this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails so number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper ! i still worry about sids but i feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy highly recommend	12
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
0	i bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective ! after a few days they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down this product is a piece of junk	12
0	this idea is nice but the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap next the tray is hard to get off and wash next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray and that is really hard to get off by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash unless you are super woman i would not bu	12
1	i agree with the above reviewers this rug is large and very well made perfect in any little girl 's room	12
1	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
0	i did n't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter 's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated ! i figured it out sort of but to this day when i push the diaper in the film rips then when it comes time to change the film the top does n't cut the film so i have to use scissors my sister in law told me to register for it why did i listen to her ! do n't buy it ! dont register for it ! it 's not worth it ! i want a refund	12
1	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12
0	the crib tent did not fit our crib it 's not deep enough or long enough i called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned i am very disatisfied with this company and the product	12
1	i ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up and not just the sides this is also sometimes refered to as a 4 sided changing pad since all 4 edges are raised it seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser effectively converting the dresser to a changing table the only reason i did n't rate this higher was that it did n't include a non skid pad on the bottom of the pad also it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover next i need to order some covers for it since the baby does n't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface i am not sure which covers to order	12
0	i thought tiny love products were good so i bought this the first one i received had the water leaking out the second one does n't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying my baby seems to like it but it does not live up to what it advertises	12
0	the product is flimsy the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine and the seat is too large for a toddler my child does not feel comfortable using this potty	12
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity yes activity at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving no moving no peek a boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby a good value at any price	12
1	this pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited i even use it at home when just watching television it creates a natural relaxing position it is a must have	12
1	i bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one this is the only one i still wear traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes i bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when i go out i sleep in the medela bra and wear it around the house i am quite large breasted and i find they have plenty of support i even do low impact aerobics in it it is worth every penny	12
0	i bought this sling when i was still pregnant after my son was born i tried putting him in it but he just did n't seem secure so i threw it in the back of the closet when he turned one i dug it out again thinking it would work well as a hip carrier but it is even worse for this ! i had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful first of all the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone it is very painful with a heavier baby i took him out of it and will never touch the thing again	12
1	this cup holder works great i attached it to a pull cart that i needed at work to put books etc in after i had foot surgery it also works on walkers	12
1	i purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care it has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other the picture quality is great and the sound is amazing i can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house ! i would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children it will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along	12
1	i purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well it is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded my son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way we 've only used it a handful of times so far but i ca n't think of one bad thing to say about it we 're very pleased with our purchase	12
0	i have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers if i install this lock the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening it also means that i would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet i'm returning it	12
1	my son is 5 months old and loves this jumper ! ! ! he can keep himself entertained and i am able to do some things with both hands ! plus it 's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down laughing ! i love the tray around it it 's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way also the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out we are going on vacation in a month and this will be making the trip !	12
0	i received a box as a shower gift and they worked okay unless i changed them a lot though they ended up leaking i was resigned to just living with wet spots until someone gave me some of the lansinoh pads to try i have no idea why babies r us does n't arry them but they really need to these things absolutely do not leak they hold tons of liquid	12
1	after using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub this one is the best ! i only wish i would 've just bought this one to begin with my little guy is 6 months old 24 pounds but ca n't sit up yet he still uses the side that lays him down in the water and he loves it ! do n't waste your money on other tubs this one is the best this one will grow with your child while saving water too	12
1	i absolutely love these paci keepers and highly recommend them they are the only ones that my son does n't manage to rip off of himself i got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear facing car seat that made for a horrible trip i purchased these and they are awesome !	12
0	i agree with several others about it being very difficult to clean there are so many nooks and crannies i used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when i had my son and it was no different my son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that i do not want to let him practice because i dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal i went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great ! now i have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair	12
1	granted it may not work for every single baby \( haha \) but i know a ton of women who swear by this blanket it is the gift i give at every shower do n't second guess yourself about whether or not to get this brand over a less expensive one you wo n't regret it	12
0	we have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us we were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us so now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor if you live out in the middle of no where or you do n't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you	12
0	we loved the monitor at first the features are nice and the price was reasonable then without event or explanation it died one day and we have n't been able to recharge one of the handheld units maybe we got a dud	12
1	it fits our baby trend car seat hooks easily to the latch anchor points and in our mid size sedan leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side	12
0	i tried this swing then this fisher price 's open travel swing in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way finally i bought the fisher price aquarium swing i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place \( so it wo n't fold over on baby \) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	12
0	i brought this gift for my son and his wife their daughter was born on 2 21 07 when i questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer they just did n't get around to using it i insisted they read the directions and start using it the next day my son stated wow mom this is the best baby shower gift they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked how much timed it saved them as new parents and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time my son was so thankful that i insisted he use the product	12
0	the image showing for this spoon set is not correct the image is for bendable spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old when you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant	12
1	i had a hard time finding a play pen for my grand daughter there are many pack n play items but i wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago this one was exactly what i wanted she has room to roll around and play with toys and it 's easy to set up and take down	12
1	the sizes are perfect especially the small one for my 5 month old the suction works fine so far but we will see as baby gets older	12
1	i cannot say enough positive things about this item ! i absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night this item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids	12
0	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage i'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend \( great proper latch ! \) and treatment for a mild yeast infection hope this helps	12
1	great fun product my baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min couple times a day we own it from 2 months he was 4 months old he simply loves it he jumps and plays with the toys absolutely the best buy	12
0	this remote is of awful quality i 've been through two of them in the past year i would n't complain so much if it did n't cost 30 ! it 's worth ten at most most people would be better off buying a cheap dvd player rather than using the xbox	13
1	you get to be different animals it is a really cool game i recommend it to other kids to buy the cheetah get shoot bow and arrows	13
1	this game was great ! it 's easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast in this one nancy is on a train that might be haunted lori girard \( your host \) invites a bunch of people including frank and joe hardy \( you actually get to play as frank in one part of the game \) then odd things start happening on the train lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train 's emergency brake is pulled this is a really fun game !	13
1	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
1	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
1	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
0	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
0	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
1	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
0	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
1	the reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because i am currently running a game of iwd1 with windows xp as i make this post	13
0	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
1	when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com	13
0	if you are looking for an xbox vertsion of another chapter in mechwarrior series this isn't it this is an extemely dumbed down version of mw even if you \( mechwarrior fans \) forget about having no customization remember this you can only fire one weapon at at time you have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets i was bored after about 5 minutes again people who never played mw series may like this game better	13
1	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
1	monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video they cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping saved 20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days i'm happy	13
1	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
1	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
1	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13
1	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
1	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
1	this was a top notch game i really enjoyed playing it it was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter the good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly \( especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time i was \) if you 've already played halo and you 're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	13
1	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
1	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
0	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
1	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	this is the most complete and most interesting racing game ever developed in the history of video games the best graphics the most cars the precise handling and did i mention the graphics wow this is amazing playing this game makes me wonder what would the next one will look like how can sony make anything that's better than this \? it is already the best racing game in the world it is simply amazing no other game could ever come close gran turismo has always been immitated but never duplicated a five out of five	13
0	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
0	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
1	very good stealth type game this game is really addicting and keeps you playing its a really intense game and gets harder level by level one of them games where it makes you think you gotta think what your next move should be like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it should you take them out \? or sneak past them \? alot of stuff like that hands down a really fun game	13
1	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
1	all i had to do was plug it into the console and bring up xbox live and it connected the only thing i did not like is that i would have preferred an ethernet connection in lieu of the usb connection other than that the product worked as intended	13
1	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13

1	i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics did n't annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba it 's kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpg 's like this it 's short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot ! it 's a lovely game	13
1	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13

0	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13

0	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13

0	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13

1	pros 1 \) wireless2 \) small3 \) lightweight4 \) you can talk to your friends when you 're in the bathroom 5 \) it has a lot of noises to tell you it 's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max cons 1 \) cliking and poping noises2 \) my charger does n't connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 \) there is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 \) have to charge it why ca n't it just have a fuel cell \? 5 \) no mute statis or indicator 6 \) it makes poping noises and a white nois	13
1	i have this monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable \( about 65 for both \) and can say that it 's the best connection you can find for your old xbox however i ca n't really recommend them due to their high prices if you can find the microsoft hd pack get that as it 's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable the only reason i bought this setup was because of their length \( 10 feet \) which can go from one side of my entertainment center \( where the xbox is \) to the other side \( where the stereo receiver is	13
0	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13

1	if i had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors i 'd choose the ds now i'm glad i have the option \( i e money \) to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where i could only take one system well you get the idea in a way the ds reminds me of the ps2 it 's a bargain it 's backwards compatible so it plays gba game the games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 you ca n't go wrong	13
0	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
0	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13

1	if you 're going to play karaoke revolution this is the mic for you i now have 2 so that my wife and i can play in duet mode it 's much better than the headset for just 17 bucks you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural if you play kr a lot invest in this microphone	13
0	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	13

1	gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 xbox and ps2 's controllers have buttons that are the same size it 's really confusing really on gamecube 's you know the a buttons the big one b 's the small one and x and y are the kidney shaped ones hard to tell them apart right	13
1	i enjoy having wireless especially with broadband i have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong set up is easy for most although if you have a linksys router wrt 54g ver 2 get ready for some work it took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice since then i have not had any problems a little expensive but worth it in the long run	13
1	when i first came home with this game and tried it i thought it was going to be kind of dumb but it is lots of fun and kind of addicting i even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking plus it is a good price	13
1	the xbox version of this game is way better for one the graphics are enhanced not crappy like the ps2 version and second of all loading time and processing time is is literally cut in half so dont buy this version suck it up and buy an xbox oh and if this game bores you you either were n't using cheats or u havent played the missions atleast throughlos santos	13

1	this game took my 9 year old son 2 days to complete it was a disappointment since i paid 30 for it but the action adventure games make younger kids to make wiser decisions overall this game deserves an a not an adult type game but fun for kids	13
0	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
1	5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves a must buy for anyone looking for a non stop action game	13

1	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
1	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
1	i like the gta series of games and this one is great too i can turn up my settings to max \( my computer is over a year old \) and there are no problems the kid reviewer claims that he does n't like the n f bomb that is why this is rated m for mature \( so he should not even be playing it \) to give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated this is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions	13
1	i 've played them all and enjoyed them all sorry this was the last one	13
0	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
0	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	13
1	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
0	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
0	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	13
1	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	13
1	this game i purchased for my sons they both told me they enjoyed this game a little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges if you want a game that is not too easy this is the one ! have fun and do n't let losing take the fun away it is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills	13

0	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
0	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13

1	this game was a lot of fun the microphone headset works great the only downside is i wish it had more songs but i guess that is what sequals are for overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself	13
1	i have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w the game i liked the stage where you can get on to the great wall of china \( i think thats what it is \) and my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8 10 ! he said it could go up if he played more the controls are so easy and fun ! ! ! i highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii	13
1	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
1	excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar	13

0	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
1	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
1	i bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that i havent been able to play it too often it was taken away from me hehehehehso my review is his and he sais that it deserves five star	13
1	i \( 37 \) played this game with my nephew \( 8 \) the other night on his birthday this is a great game funny characters have great individual personalities traits ! just like ever with any cool game we started playing laughed alot lost track of time 1 hour had passed he was playing ps2 im buying it for my xbox tonight you should buy it for your system definitely worth it ! !	13
1	i 've been a gta fan for a few years now and to me san andreas has got to be the best one for the first time you can swim ! ! i fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character the graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you 'll get used to it the language is terrible \( more so in this gta version \) so young kids should avoid this like the plague	13
1	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
0	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
1	it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline	13
0	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
1	the gta series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created	13
1	this is perhaps the best of the final fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated ix had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay the characters are some of the most delightful in the series personally i think vivi and zidane are the coolest characters ever lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline on a sidenote this game definitely deserves a remake there 's a lot of hype about final fantasy vii its own prequel and a remake coming for ps3 i feel that final fantasy ix should be remade on the ps3 i love the story line better than vii the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible	13
0	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
0	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
1	this game rocks you 've got action storytelling quests your own path linear gameplay and the world is alive people have jobs and work times and play times the controls are a little quirky but worth the hassle	13

1	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	13
0	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
1	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
0	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
0	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
0	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
1	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
1	i have been a staunch final fantasy fan for years while waiting for the newest release which kept being pushed back i tried out xenosaga let me tell you i am grateful i have ! this game is one of the most entertaining and interesting games i have ever played the world is absolutely amazing and the characters are unique not to mention a plot that has profound depth you will fall in love trust me if you are looking for an rpg that will draw you in and keep you playing for hours it is xenosaga	13
0	i bought this for my xbox 360 and it does n't work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews i 've read here at least by not working it is n't damaging my xbox 360	13
1	this game is alot like call of duty 2 the graphics are better than 2 the play is almost the same the online play is where the game thrives the online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game if you love shooters you will love this game	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
0	the controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything i'm a long time gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme plus for all the people talking about immersion i just do n't see it i just could n't get myself to care about the world or story i was in it did n't grab me like some games do	13
1	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
0	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
0	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
1	before kurt warner had a career with the st louis rams he played for the arenabowl champion iowa barnstomers when he endorsed this game called kurt warner 's arena football unleashed the music is rockin' and up to date you can crank it up to the sound effects are great on this game if you hear that doink ! sound it looks like a hanna barbera cartoon and the commentary is way better than that tim guy from nfl blitz oh and for every touchdown you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6 this game is way more better than nfl blitz unfortunately it was the last hope for any more arena football games on any system	13
0	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
0	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
0	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
1	the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin	13
1	this is the original playstation controller and it is the best it feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy if you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling i strongly reccommend do not buy the big mad catz controller it does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks just stick with the sony controler it is the best of the best	13
0	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
1	the e reader is one of the best things that happened to nintendos gba this is so swea	13
1	basically if you like 04 05 and 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics i like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it this is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge	13
1	the memory card 1019 from nintendo is excellent for saving gamecube saves i used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games and some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them i tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted i have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing i have saved has become corrupted even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like the sims 2 i still have more than enough space left the price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already	13
0	i noticed there were not many new items in this game i found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving this expansion ws not worth the money	13
1	yeah this game is really fun just gets extremely hard at times towards the end have a little over 10 hours into it kind of short i guess but each mission might take you a few tries to complete plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like i did i 'd say it 's easily one of the best games out for the ds though one that everyone should have in their ds collection	13
1	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
0	i really could not tell you anything as i still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago	13
1	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
1	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
1	all of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy tv 's i mean it could be that i have a 20 inch sony trinitron and the halo special edition xbox too but i have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends \( in real life \) or anyone in my counterstrike clan \( on xbox live \) that have old tv 's and regular xboxesreccomendation if the picture is crappy buy a new tv	13
0	every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie \( from russia with love which is actually not a bad game \) recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply could n't resist picking up scarface the world is yours i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love this but it turns out i did n't the controls are really a joke instead of your normal fps 3ps rpg etcetera there are really bland controls you ca n't even tell what to do the dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke for die hard fans only i guess	13
1	i bought this game on ps2 for my daughter who is 12 and she has had a ball playing it though there are english subtitles because it is spoken in very fast japanese that does n't take away from the game 's adventures the instructions given are very clear and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks it really is quite enjoyabl	13
0	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
1	after playing this game for 16 days \( i finally finished it after 91 hours of game play \) i now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards it is just that good ! try not to breeze your way right through it though or you 'll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience take your time and enjoy it not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy this game requires you to think befor you do things it really is a fun game to play and overall that 's what playing games are all about having fun !	13
1	graphically this game is a work of art the shiny surfaces glowing lightsabers and vibrant colors make this a winner as far as gameplay those you can even forget the graphics ! this gameplay is so good you could play it with terrible graphics and still have an aweseome time ! the score by john williams is another highlight the music enhances the tension action and drama of this game overall this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played	13
0	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
1	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	13
1	when it comes to the gc gba cable you wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games but it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing depending on the game and what features it opens up plus it is cheap to get and once you 've gotten this wonderful item you will wonder why you didnt get it sooner i know from my own experience	13
1	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
0	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13
1	this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice	13
0	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
1	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	13
1	i very much enjoyed this game and i think it may be my favorite x box game i own ! i kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better ! one funny part about this game is the part where you are sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable	13
1	this is a great cable for your hd tv while playing you sony playstation 2 it give very crisp and clear images much better than the cable that comes with the playstation	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
1	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
1	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
1	i'm enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when i received it i have n't had the chance to play as much as i 'd like but i will	13
1	this is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the ps2 for all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research ! i can figure out a way to solve the problem and i'm only 13 ! you are all over 21 ! ar max memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that 's the price for cheating who ever said that cheating would be fair \? overall besides the max memory portion this item is great	13
1	mechassault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine destroying other mechs and tanks as well but when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again \? no not if you have xbox live in live you can play capture the flag download new mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more if you do n't have xbox live or a system link that your wasting your money	13
1	this is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game this game works with xp however you need to have a combo drive that includes dvd writer c d combo writer i have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly	13
1	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
1	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
1	this game is just freakin' awesome im not that big into video games and i really only play them when i have someone to play against i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack then came duty i played this game through on all the difficulty modes from medium up and never got bored plus if you 've got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking multiplayer is sweet \( esp if you break up into teams \) and you can talk smack all day long best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen	13
1	this game is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle one time i was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game only three shots will kill you i had to restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it	13
1	if your tired of all the first person shooters and rpgs this game rocks it was 1990 all over again for me love the game since i didnt have anm original playstation i can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me \) the only issue i have is that you cant play 2 player but i can forgive that	13
1	the ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today the black color is a really nice option too i think it looks much more elegant the only complaint i can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black	13
1	i love this game for what it is you cannot expect this to be anything like madden but it is still a fun game injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced fast paced something i cannot say about the loading this game is the slowest loading game i have ever played it actually took three minutes for it to load one time get this game provided that you can wait a little bit	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
1	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
0	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
0	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
1	make no mistake about it this game has more than a few bugs and sudden desktop crashes it is also one of the most immersive and totally enjoyable games i have ever played i am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds if not thousands of video games since the 70 's this game has it all as far as role playing games go one bit of advice about this game is save often save often save often oh and one more thing be sure to save often	13
0	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
1	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
1	this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you 'd be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks chris	13
1	and three years later i buy the game wow ! awesome ! i ca n't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release ! everything looks and feels great on my xp this is one of the only games i have purchased and and not had to return due to the cd being messed up or some corrupted file so i'm happy ! i thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on yep this is a game i would suggest to any gamer	13
0	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs at age 70 those needs are many after approximately two rounds of trying it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general	14
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them i wish i had known this before now i have to waste about 20 in shipping to return it do not buy for body fat measurement	14
1	i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store with school and all it 's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight i 've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early !	14
1	these are great glasses easy to put on and take off and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some amazon was the place to go	14
0	it looks alot better than it works very bad vibrations	14
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago and have been very satistfied with it the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush the price is good the battery life is good and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !	14
0	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight we returned it to amazon probably the first time we 've ever had to do that for the price it should at least work also in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner it earns two stars for looking great i would not recommend it	14
1	looking for something small and portable \? this is perfec	14
1	this book is beautiful outside i love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front what i do not like is how there is no specific places to write in you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page too much like scrapbooking for me i wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in for example one blank page will say all about mom then another that says baby shower etc but the pages are blank i need more structure	14
1	this is the best investment ever ! they start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin it was so easy to set up start enjoying i 've used it on average twice a week and my feet hands are so wonderfully moist even in this winter weather my heels are no longer cracked my cuticles are so healthy not snagging at all thank you for this perfect product so much cheaper than going to the salon ! it 's so relaxing \( i use lavender \) as i do this just before bed	14
0	i thought they might 've improved the hgm 15 model forget about it both models are lousy buy foreign it might work better	14
1	i 've been using the omron hbf 306 body fat analyzer for a month or so now so far i 've been very impressed with its consistency however i would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the omron 's measurements to see how accurate it is it 's well built and very easy to use once you set up your profile it only takes a few seconds to get a read i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with still a good product at a good price	14
1	just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived melted as noted by another reviewer i ended up placing in the fridge and then taking out before eating turns out i did n't find them that great directly from the fridge also they just did n't taste as fresh as the ones i buy individually from wal mart i could n't tell if that was because they had melted or just were n't as fresh to start with	14
1	i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately 9 00 22 00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon	14
1	very handy and portable fits my neck good and i can even walk around with it on and not worry about it falling off or moving	14
0	takes forever to shave and still does n't get everything still have to end up shaving with a razor frustrating but good concept	14

0	i had heard that chocoleans were effective but i was very disappointed they taste good but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate i wound up gaining weight while using these	14
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable not so ! they tear easily better than just empty wal mart bags though but not by much	14
1	great product easy to use and simple to follow instruction keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks i recommend it to anyone it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do buy it wear it be happy	14
0	we started getting a lo message when using the thermometer it said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense this worked for a little while we changed the tip on each use now nothing works after spending near 50 on this i feel like a chump i want to throw it out the window i'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else	14
0	this book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st 2nd and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages so this book wasnt worth what i payed for it	14
0	returned right after i tried it does not get hot at all very disappointed since it is so expensive	14
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c a completely pathetic rip off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond	14
0	this is the worst shaver i have ever used it is cheaply made and completely useless do n't waste your mone	14
0	the price is too high considering the ijoy 550 model is only us 599 99 at sharper image	14
1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review it is an excellent dryer the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers however since it dries my hair fast my arms do n't mind the weight \) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !	14
0	this pedometer is so much cheaper \( 7 \) than the typical decent ones \( that go for about 18 20 \) now i know it is for a reason the buttons are flimsy the package looks very cheap the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen did not work also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device terrible ergonomics form factor would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron oregon sc 18 pedometers much better form factor high reliability and quality	14
1	it is really great ! ! ! sure it does hurt but not any more than waxing i do not shave because i get cut very easily this is a great alternative to expensive waxing even when i have more hair it works i would buy this product again and again	14
0	i purchased these as a christmas gift for my daughter they take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair for the money i do n't think they were worth it	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
0	it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it 's not all that noisy but i had no idea i 'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier does n't have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i 'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room	14
1	this small flosses is great to get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it the little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth happened at least couple of times so i switch to the string floss	14
0	these did not suppress my appetite though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil \( also a hoodia product \) but the next bottle of that nothing i guess like crops you can get good batches and bad batches these struck me as a bad batch as one reviewer said i actually felt hungrier many days egad ! better luck next time ! sigh	14

1	we love this item ! ! ! we get older tv show dvds from netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come if the cleaner does n't work and it generally does our back up is the repair stuff which almost always does i think out of 30 disks only two were not fixed	14
0	results were never consistent many err readings i was definitely no satisfied	14
1	i love them ! i have a fairly expensive 6 piece lithograph and each piece is about 15 lbs we were not only able to hang them with minimal damage to the drywall but have them almost perfectly abutting each other	14
0	the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct the description of this product is a misnomer the heating pad never heats up and takes forever to just warm up on a scale of 1 to 5 i would rate it a zero ! do n't waste your money on this i will be returning mine	14
1	this has helped me more than i can say it has helped with a death of a very close relative without this i would n't be able to lead a normal day at my high level stress job	14

0	i bought this straightener because i wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp however while it is not a horrible product i have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better i would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store this is n't any better than those	14

1	i tried the ear thermometers and never could get them to work our pediatrician used one of these rub across the forehead kind at her office during a checkup and said it was as accurate as the ear kind and much easier to use especially when kids have earaches \( grabbing an itty bitty earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen sore ear canal \? \? \? ouch \) with a minute 's practice \( after reading the instructions \) you get the hang of using it and never dread checking temperatures again	14
0	i also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months i really loved this machine though ! it actually blew air ! and it has the nice safe switches unlike the toggles that most have now i had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while i was gone and almost burned the place down so anyway i'm trying to contact the manufacturer but i doubt it will do any good too bad loved it while it worked hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before i saw the reviews	14
0	it lasted one year and two weeks then the motor died while it worked it was great i am tempted to buy a replacement but will probably end up trying another brand the manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several because when they do work they do a great job	14

0	i followed the directions on the package but could not get these disks to adhere to my canker sore even one in the flattest part of my cheek obviously they wo n't stick to sores on the gumline or inside of lip either cankaid and kank a are still the non prescription products i have found that provide relief and are much easier to apply	14

0	let me start by saying i think the regular guru energy drink is the best on the market i only wish i could say the same about guru lite there is nothing positive about this drink it is awful ! i was very excited about trying the lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage you might as well take a ginseng or ginkgo biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth if you are big fan of the regular guru stay with it and do n't waste your money on their lite version	14

1	i came across the hooah drink because my boss a retired military man running for office always has a case lying around with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long these are invaluable for getting me through the day and keeping my thoughts coherent apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent i ca n't measure that in myself of course but i do sense a dramatic improvement	14
1	this curling iron works well it heats quickly and i'm very satisfied	14
0	this thing did not survive the unpacking inserted the battery put the housing back and bent a plastic doohicky in the inside not worth it	14
0	does n't work on coarse hairs does n't remove only trims okay for fine light hair of course if you have fine light hair you do n't need to try to remove	14
0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair he 's got thick hair that we like to keep buzzed short the first time i used the clippers he complained that they really pull at the hair i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair i 've decided to send it back reasonably priced but not worth the pain not recomended for thick hair	14
1	this is the best and easiest to use back brush ! i have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just did n't do it but with this brush no more missed spots just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time never felt so clean	14
0	the good the massage function works fine no problems with the performance and the battery holds a good charge the bad how much money is saved in construction by using thecheapest foam padding imaginable \? the ugly the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months maybe a cheaper material could have been found but i doubt it overall good in theory but very poor in execution if some real quality were put into the product it would rate potentially 5 stars 'til then you 've been warned	14
0	had this for less than a month and it just stopped heating the only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nice but for the dozen times used it was not worth buying will be returning it	14
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track i was figuring on getting an arm unit but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work the whole system is very easy to use and fast you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy i can say this was a great gift something i use a lot and something that will help me stay healthy	14
1	i do a lot of walking as well as standing on my feet all day for work receiving this product as a test drive was fabulous ! i never knew a cream could work so well at relieving my tired aching feet and restoring my skin i 'd definitely recommend this product	14

1	i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body after drinking monster all day my body felt like a mess \( from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body \) there are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls	14

0	i 've used the cardiochek 6 times and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200 with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points it is a lot of trouble \( and expensive \) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol hdl cholesterol and triglycerides no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek the box says includes check strips but those are something other than test strips	14
1	have used this product on myself for many years when particapating in ultra endurance cycling events as well as on my family when vacationing in tropical area 's where the sun will cook you quickly without adequate sun protection do not be fooled by thinking you will not get tanned by using spf 45 or better that is a misconception why not walk away from your experience in the sun without the discomfort of sun poisoning found best result 's when put on indoors prior to being in the sun	14
1	i really liked the outside design of the book a lot of books were cartoonish and really was drawn to the look of the book i wish the book did not have so much random fill in pages i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events ages of the child but all in all i am pleased with it i would most likely buy again	14
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	these are very tasty they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you they also are great in a diaper bag purse center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination	14
0	this thing is horrible cumbersome to use and does nothing i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug carpet i'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it 0	14
1	this is a good little product did not expect much but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep thank	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
1	i have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies i have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks ! ! my son still fits in the size diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it no leaks no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning !	14
0	this stuff smells bad like a mix of medicine and pesticide had to throw it out	14
0	over time \( 9 months \) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing customer service told me to buy a new one i guess it really is 'all about the money' pass this loser buy a metal body filter	14
0	this razor is not worth the money it did shave pretty well for a few months but the rubber strips wear out really quickly and even though the cleaning option with the fluid seems like a great idea it does not work very well the razor was never clean and refilling the fluid is just a pain i would not recommend this razor	14
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that my soup was luke warm at lunchtime	14
0	my girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday he wo n't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on we can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it the main reason he quit listening is because after i spent time trying to set the station in the morning during his shower the station would automatically change to another one give me a break ! this is a worthless radio it does n't even deserve 1 star	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14

0	this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out i was delighted with the larger size but the new pad did not heat at all i returned it to homedics \( along with the 5 handling charge \) and two months later they sent a replacement the replacement heats up but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted it almost looks like it has melted to itself and it ca n't be flattened out i wo n't be sending this one back with another 5 handling charge it is n't worth it this one goes out with the trash and i go back to sunbeam	14
0	this product was not as i expected it is much weaker than ones used in the past it certainly was not worth the price i paid i returned this item	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14
0	the monitor works really well the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking if you are looking for a good basic monitor this is a great unit	14
1	i 've been using nicads for long long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units gps walkie talkie 's flashlights etc however these newer nimh are just great no memory shelf and longer current life nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a	14
0	i tried this product because i had been using arthred g powder which was discontinued this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it it tasted and smelled rather like soap if you used arthred g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage there is no comparison here ! ! ! i would totally avoid this product	14
0	i had a good massaging heating pad that was great and i used it on my legs a lot thought i could replace it this one is not even in the ballpark absolutely useless i have been had	14
1	i have used opti free enzymatic cleaner for years still with the same great results i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer because my using extended wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock	14
1	this nature made product is excellent however readers should be aware that this products does not contain iron for a very good reason taking iron supplements sets you up for potential health problems if you are a woman over 50 i hope the other reviewer takes note of this	14
1	they are a nice compact size for travel they work as advertised just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated quick curl time	14
0	unfortunately total block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin it caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day i do n't doubt this is an excellent sunblock just not for my rosacea sensitive skin i use it now on my arms with no problems i do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase	14
0	this product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised there are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries i do not recommend this ! just get new glasses	14
0	this bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars that much is true what is also true is that is contains more fat what you will notice with the first bite is that the bar seems somehow inflated there is an emptiness to consistency of the bar you are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a myoplex or apex bar stick with those brands for pure nutrition and far better taste these metrx bars leave you feeling as though you 've eaten something that was bad for you like after you eat a dessert yet these will not be mistaken for desserts	14
1	sedamine is great sleep aid i 've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and i tried nearly everything including old remedies i thought i would go crazy if i did n't find help not sleeping has been awful since end of july i started with the sedamine product and it started working right way i tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone	14

0	we bought this as a cheap easy stocking stuffer it 's simply not woth anything the little file is a good idea but too tiny to actually work my daughter \( 8yrs old \) liked the idea too but was sad that she could n't work with the tiny strip that 's too short for even her little fingers cute but not worth it	14
0	i bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it i was not it snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude very unhappy with this purchase	14
1	i am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk yet i need to work and that means that i have to be standing long hours so when i tried your leg massagers i was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use i now use it every chance i get my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well it is one of the best purchases i have made it was worth the investment	14
0	of course it works great for as long as it works after some time my unit develped a leak unlike better showerheads the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time causing the seals to not set properly resulting in the kind of leak mine developed unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years i 'd stay away fom this model and good luck navigating watrepik 's website to get any help	14
1	saw this product or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns australia it was selling for about 70 australia dollars which is still quite expensive converted to us i came back to u s and found it on amazon for 15 99 with free ship if i purchased 30 so i bought two one for myself one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks less the neckchains which always used to get tangled it 's an ingenius invention	14
1	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out while i do n't use it everday i use it regularly and when needed i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated this nivea after shave is wonderful it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on it gets your day off to a great start no funky smells or textures here give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	14
0	i 've had this straightener for about 3 months i loved it at first but now it 's a love hate relationship the gold plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use the effect my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results save your and buy a professional model from a hairdresser it 's cheaper in the long run	14
0	this will require a large mitten in colder weather this does not appear to use electrical impulse this will require more adapting to than you might think when working it is accurate	14
1	i did n't have any trouble with them being too large i tested them in a battery operated light string against a no name non rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time	14
1	this is a truly amazing deal from amazon where i also received free priority mail shipping the photo does not display all that you will get you will receive 6 boxes of q tips cotton swabs totaling an ammazing 3 500 q tips in all i will never ever have to purchase another q tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !	14
1	great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot the plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit yet the plastic will off gas works best on couch while watching tv movies for anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out i highly recommend this to help get you back into shape	14
0	i bought the duro med 7921lcst bg because of a back injury i need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably this product is very disappointing the material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all if you need firm back support i would look elsewhere \( i do n't know of a good source yet \) if you do n't need such support then i do n't know why you 'd have any interest in this product but i suppose there could be valid reasons that i ca n't imagine	14
1	just as it advertised it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly i bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out well i am sold on this product only drawback now is the high price tag	14
1	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it from a novice 's point of view this is a great meditation aid i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack	14
0	i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i could n't get a consistent reading the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless ! ! very disappointed ! ! i returned it without even the box	14
0	it was an awkward mess smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered much less fit securely it 'd probably be easier without the trays i do n't know if they work or not i gave up i want my crest whitestrips back	14
1	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer i would recommend this hair dyer	14
1	bought this for my husband who has a 2 hour \( one way \) commute by bus to work he loves it now he can nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck it is very portable with a small carrying case and is easy to blow up a bargain for the price	14
0	printed all over the box are the words with infrared heat the instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water 's warm temperatures this would n't be the case the water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice but does nothing at all to keep the water warm	14
1	after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed but it 's been over 2 months and so far so good i sleep on it every night \( i'm buying a real bed when i move in june \) and it is holding up	14
1	this was a gift it came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at so we were happy	14
0	i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone	14
1	loving this air purifier ! this was really the first one i have own so i ca n't compare it to any others it is very quite and takes alot of dust out of the air the first time i had to replace the filter i was shocked by how much dust i could of been breathing in worth picking up just wish it would of had an energy star label	14
0	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap even if i really tighten it up i still get a small leak when i shake it also the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy but overall it gets the job done and having fluid graduations on the side are nice	14
1	shaving cream in a tube is just about impossible to buy at retail outlets this is a great product and i will continue to buy it through amazon	14
1	best hair dryer ever i have long thick curly frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x my hair is shiny and soft the diffuser is also amazing i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz by far the best dryer out there in this price range granted it 's heavy but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones \?	14
1	i own this unit for more than a year bought it in the local drug store for 20 first unit was bad displaying low battary error i exchanged it same day for another one i compared readings with traditional thermometers and found it to be very accurate fast and can show in both c and f the best i 've ever had the case is bad lock broke in a week	14
0	this brush is worth about 10 bucks anything more and you are throwing money down the drain	14
0	it 's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror i suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification the light is not great at all it 's very dim one of the good qualities of the mirror is that it 's cordless and comes with an adapter if you do n't have batteries handy	14
0	i got this as a gift for christmas and i 've tried it twice so far both times i get the same result it does n't work i understand that with wet hair it wo n't dry it obviously but even with damp hair as instructed it does n't get my hair dry as for the actual straightening aspect i still end up with frizzy hair that is n't even all that straight it 's not worth the money spend the extra bucks and get a chi or infrashine you 'll be a lot better off	14
1	i have been very satisfied with the monitor it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included a quick phone call had them on the way i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time etc all in all it is a quite satisfactory device	14
1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids but i find it perfect for me it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber what more can you ask for	14
0	the razor i bought came with packets of this gel as well as the lotion possibly due to the consistency the gel gets used up more quickly it is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is the key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol the gel has menthol so that 's why it can be irritating i read a review of shaving basics online and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol the lotion on the other hand always helps get a better shave and is quite soothing	14
1	i appreciate the gentle yet powerful cleaning of all free clear allergen detergent i have an infant find this cleans her clothes ours well without leaving any harsh irritants so it 's easier to do the family 's laundry all together	14
1	very nice scale worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh	14
0	skip this entire product i made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non scrubbing \( mopping \? \) pads now i ca n't find the non scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county i think they do n't want to compete with their own product swiffer which they also manufacture i emailed them and they suggested i buy online i checked walgreens com and drugstore com and no luck i imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful who gives a hoot rod	14
1	i bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband after the first night i knew i wanted one to put in our rv too my husband complained about the smell when i unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years he had me order one for his sister for christmas i thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now i have purchased four ! this is a wonderful product i would recommend it to anyone	14
0	while the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good this pillow is too small to do an adult much good it is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose it could be perfect perhaps for a child	14
1	i 've owned this item for about a year and it works great comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and never had a problem with it deflating i recommend this item	14

0	they 're ok but definately not as absorbent as the overnight diapers my son soaks through if he urinates during the night	14
0	i like the idea but the slippers just are n't comfortable to stand on it 's great while you are sitting though	14
0	the description says slipcover zips off for easy cleaning but the product did not come with a slipcover the pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern now i have to find a slipcover that wo n't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath	14
0	this item did n't work very well it was n't a close shave at all i used it twice before my dog chewed it up it left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it	14
1	this was my heating pad but my hairless cat took it over he has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one the first day i could n't pry him off i love that it 's washable in fact i'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash of course i keep it pretty low for him being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that 's not enough	14
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these mine arrived with one case broken open although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag	14
1	i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip my roommate is a snorer and i figured i needed the sound i tried it out at home and liked it it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel it was a good buy for my purposes	14
0	this shaver only works on short or fine hair if your hair is long \( more than 1 4 inch \) or coarse it just skips over the hair and does n't do anything i 've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors	14
1	i 've had one of these little trimmers for four or five years now it does its jobs and i 've have no reliability problems at all one word of advice do n't use it on the boys without the little plastic guard or you 'll be sorry	14
0	was initially impressed with the backrest however because the straps are not adjustable it dose n't stay in place the one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place	14
1	this product works great they recharge fast are just warm to the touch not hot and have extremely long battery life battery charger works great and has nice car charger adapter	14
0	i bought this shaver about one year ago for years i was using braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition in spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan i gave panasonic a try shaving is fine it runs quiet and you get 5 7 shaves with one charge after about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3 4 shaves with one recharge month later slowly went dead exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards what make me to believe to those people writing reviews you would expect more shave for 100 today i went to buy braun shaver	14
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them i am very disappointed the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste it 's very hard to clean it 's loud and small brush not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive no thank you	14
0	if you 're interested in the chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots my friend owns one and at first i was envious but now i rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots this model has the same shape as the riviera and as i stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic the riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so i would be skeptical in buying this one the only reason i gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you ca n't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly	14
0	within two weeks the hose connection was leaking the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the	14
0	the mirror did not work the lights and clock did not work and i did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up i would have to get a new box and take it to the ups place to send it which would have cost me about another 10 and quite frankly it was just not worth the time nor the money	14
0	i have had this straightener for about a year it will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and i have to use the high heat settings also my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener	14
1	this is the 2nd year that i have used the neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock spf 45 i have normal to oily sensitive acne prone skin i am fair and can burn easily i think this product is well worth the money it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel it does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out i apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours the time will vary depending on your sun tolerance though it is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile	14
0	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months after about 2 3 weeks of use the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the off position the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks i definitely do not recommend buying this product	14
1	i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this great product ! !	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
1	very convenient reading glasses you could hang them on your neck when not using them and not even notice they are there they are very sturdy and are flexible making them almost imposible to break cons both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair as the glasses would trap your hair against your face	14
1	i used the remington twice up to now and the bottom line it is a great machine you will never need to lube it and that is a big deal with clippers its easy to clean sharp and easy to work with	14
1	this water jet is excellent it allows you to have a separate chamber for water and mouthwash it also comes with different attachments for your gums teeth and tongue excellent product at an excellent price	14
0	worked alright for a few months i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it did n't the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again	14
0	this pad works basically but it does turn itself after 30 minutes there 's no way to prevent that this may be fine for some uses but it 's very inconvenient for others	14
0	i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it	14

0	it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells whistles i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great	14
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb i tried contacting the company with this new one u cannot get an answer the company seems to have a non working number other than that the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it	14
0	i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence it does not work the same and the product is not the same i must clarity that i dont want to confuse anyone here youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh or gritty it is very smooth and makes yours skin incredible and soft	14
0	i'm very sorry but the universal remote control was not what i expected like when i want to turn on my tv the vcr came on and visa versa but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money very pleased about the service thanks regards yoka van dijk	14
0	i 'd give this machine 5 stars if 1 \) it was n't so expensive and 2 \) it was n't so darn small it barely fits anything inside it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two but that 's about it anything else just wo n't fit and the design of the inside with the piece in the middle makes it even more restricting in my personal opinion this product is not worth the money i am so disappointed because it sounded so perfect but its just not	14
0	when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs also this is a big scale too big to store in the bathroo	14
1	item was received in perfect shape it is a wonderful item and a great buy	14
0	i purchased the product found it to be not accurate also in order to get your ldl result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it costly ! ! cumbersome ! ! ! 3 times niddle your fingers ! ! i returned the product	14
1	these are very tasty they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you they also are great in a diaper bag purse center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination	14
0	because if you do this is the unit to do it with ! the combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro 's internal circuitry with metal deposits no i do not work in a metal shop i use my computer solely in my apartment room yes it is from the humidifer the dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas	14

0	this thing does n't massage just vibrate and two of the motors died quickly although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty the customer service is non existent stay away from this definitely not worth the money	14
0	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips wrong answer i was able to play 2 1 2 cds before my box was out of juice game over i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left i figured they 'd at least last into the night but they were finished before sundown do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices i got fooled fool me once shame on you we ca n't get fooled again	14
1	works great no problems after 4 months	14
1	received the monitor quickly it works well the automatic feature is great	14
0	i 've tried this razor for 5 weeks both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that i 've ever used it does n't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble i shouldhave bought a new norelco instead of this my old norelco alwaysshaved me close this panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor or to be used in a pinch but for a close shaving everyday razor this is n't the one to buy oh well i waited too long to send it back	14
1	i ordered one of these for my girlfriend and she loves it friends and family have tried it and are thrilled this product will make holiday shopping easy for several women on my list	14
1	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads different sizes for many years and i'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating i would n't be without mine it helps me manage my arthritis fibromylagia nerve damage pain i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well	14
1	i 've been using 2 of these batteries in my walkman for 10 hours now and they are still going very strong it 's living up to its reputation as described so far	14
1	this is such a great product for nursing moms it is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from happening for a mom this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt	14
0	this was a piece of junk neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly we wound up throwing it away going to target and buying one of their 10 000 steps pedometer that works great	14
0	i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington i liked that shaver so when i found the r 950 at sears on sale for 40 i decided to replace my old top selling brand rotary shaver big mistake after 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck \( especially with drier winter skin \) not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r 950 while trying to shave around the mouth i am going back to my old shaver how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave but it does	14
1	the toothbrush is great feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned	14
1	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate but it takes a while for it to give a reading the first few times i used it it took over a minute to tell me my pulse however the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster so far this is true as within the last 3 days i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently considering the price it was a good purchase	14
1	these seem to be an excellent product there is little or not leakage the wipes were a nice treat	14
1	i bought this product because i had a borderline high reading at my doctor 's office rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop pay just to have it monitored we purchased this unit it works wonderful very simple and gives more information than i expected	14
1	this is easy to use and set up it even has a 3rd space for a guest you do n't have to get your body fat and water each time i like it	14
0	i really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that i'm not too happy about the filter does n't lock down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out the filter plops out of the top causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher it 's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it 's worth the other brita pitcher i have the filter locks into place and does n't do this	14
1	really strong when just sprayed but after a little while it gets soft but at the same time not too soft the perfume lasts for few hours by the time i go to bed the scent would still be there faintly and i fall asleep to it it is fresh and strong at first then soft and sweet love it	14
1	my kids really liked how it did n't feel like suntan lotion	14
0	this is the worst waste of money i have ever had the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups 3x magnification \? \? \? more like 9x ! ! ! you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors my suggestion would be not to waste your money on it its a joke	14
0	paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses	14
1	heats up quickly tends to dry out more than previous chi flat iron i had much more economical	14
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact useful size however the rollers take a long time to heat up even if left plugged in for a half hour they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair i would not recommend this product	14
1	i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b c washable ones were sufficient with my second child i did both and i found these to be the best b c washable ones are not enough they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched they are very thin and discreet other pads are not as big so not enough overage i never bother with the adhesives b c they do n't work they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk i just wished they were softer and less paper like	14
1	i am a foot reflexologist and i highly recommend this product it is very helpful in working the reflexes on the bottom of the feet	14
0	i got this device to help me clean around my place i thought it would be easy to use and it is not the pads do not stay on when you are trying to put them on the solution leaks all over you after working on my shower i saw no difference i wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth	14
1	this is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs also check out elaine petrone 's miracle balls which you can also use in the car and for other things the support is sturdy and has a mesh back which helps to keep you cool and comfortable a great deal for the cost	14
0	i ordered the regular size they were to big the smaller size \? too small neither one fit well but both did one thing well hurt the area under my eyes buyer beware	14
1	a good product to be sure i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased this review is however a cautionary while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads it is only rated for 18 loads just a heads up ! note i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment thus this review	14
0	this was a terrible product i got little sores everywhere i used it believe me i will only use it once wish i had my money back	14
1	this is a great fiber supplement ! ! when you chew it it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet tart i usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you do n't need water they have a good flavor and yes i do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas \) so do n't be in a small elevator	14
1	i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair \( and have it stay straight \) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners and this one is by far the best i have long curly hair and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes much better than the hour i'm used to plus the straightening lasts my hair stays completely flat all day instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener you simply ca n't get better than this !	14
0	this glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse since one still has full function of his her hands when using this you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing when using these gloves your hands and wrist will feel better at first but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse	14
1	after looking into several reviews on blow dryers i learned about the revlon tourmaline all of the reviews were so positive i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are the placement could n't be better on the controls the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive a very good value	14
1	i am so happy with aquasana shower filter i live in a building where the water is so harsh and sometimes discolored as a consequence my skin shortly turned dry and i continuously got skin problems i even thought about buying drinking water to clean my face everyday now that i have found aquasana i feel so happy it does what it promises i could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first time and it did feel like showering in natural spring water i could n't be happier with this product	14
1	i used this product and ca n't say enough good things about it my friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and i lost 30 pounds in 6 months and i was never hungry i ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my dietmate i love it thank yo	14
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out not only did it not work for anything it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass also it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener needless to say i 'll be taking this back for an exchange i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair	14
1	the only sunglass reading glasses i could find plus because they can hang around the neck i do n't forget where they are	14
1	i purchased this dryer for my wife it took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting my wife 's hair is thick and long so she did n't want get anything below 2000 watts this one is light powerfull and handy i strongly recommend it	14
1	i have had so much fun learning bio feedback and learnig to breath the exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation i highly recommned this product i will be purchasing the add on in the near future	14
0	hello i recently bought this blood pressure monitor it functions all well but it gives incorrect readings i mean the readings vary significantly not once twice but many many times i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings purchase this at your own risk my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors atleast u will know that the readings r genuine and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings take care and stay healthy	14
1	i used the huggies overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training i used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull ups to get him through the night without leaks but even that did n't work very well finally huggies came out with an overnight pull up and it really works well ! ! ! excellent product	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle she adores the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly not to mention that i a hearty creature in my prime love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors	14
1	delivers moist heat great large size you wo n't find anything larger anywhere very relaxing as lavender is calming only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes i have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min and lied down with head neck in comfortable position and it did a great job pricey but worth it	14
0	but leaves a lot to be desired in practice just get a small electric or hand crank food processor this is not worth your time	14
0	way too expensive for little in return the same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling	14
0	be sure to measure your arm before purchasing it 's annoying to receive the unit with the standard adult arm cuff \( fits arms 9 to 13 inches around \) and find out i have to order a larger arm cuff ! do n't bother calling omron customer service at 1 800 634 4350 just a typical big company voice mail hell ! it even tells you to call another number to order the piece my 1 star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and omrons customer service	14
1	this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot watch your ears and fingertips	14
0	i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it well i really do n't care for it and now i ca n't find the return sticky label to return it and i'm really bummed about that because it cost 55 ! ! maybe if you could help me with that that would be great ! thanks beck	14
1	for me a good tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer i had the same one this brand for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment i immediately ordered my new tweezer if not dropped i suspect this would last a lifetime	14
0	i returned this biofeedback software and hardware i was happy with amazon 's quick credit back to my credit card but i found this purchase totally lacking the games it had you play were boring and i would n't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback	14
0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist however it is difficult to use extremely messy and the on off button on handle is difficult to press we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience our neighbors bought the same model tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave save your money and go back to flossing !	14
1	while a little dubious i am know a believer really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts start with a single scoop and adjust as needed	14
1	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results the size of the cuff is very important so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results this is true in the doctors office also my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office on his machine just by changing the size of the cuff this is an excellent monitor i could n't be happier with it it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too	14
0	i was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source agree with other users this mirror was no better than an unlighted one	14
1	it 's small folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer i just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot very convenient item if you travel	14
0	while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products this conditioner \( and i might add shampoo by the same name \) was a real disappointment using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one i'm saving my for lush and frederic fekkai	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
1	i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too a v close shave in about 2 minutes i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness i dont use the cleaning station i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased	14
0	the shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible this razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary but using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin this razor does not poduce a light lather it is more like a slime that drips from it i did not notice a tropical scent	14
0	it felt nice when my head and neck were resting on the real ease but the device failed to relieve the tension in my upper back and neck \( past the time i spent lying on the device \) i'm about 6' tall	14

0	no moving parts contrary to depiction above the attachments are tiny plastic 1 5 knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet ! they do not move there is no massaging action you do all the work making your hips and knees sore the massaging foot beds are totally motionless and form a spiky painful surface vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device jets are totally underpowered no fill line indicator so bubbles spill water onto floor heater is completely useless after 15 minutes water temp was no different cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads classic deception in advertising	14
0	i explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand my hands are still buzzing from the night before when i used this product i would not recommend this product to anyone else i loved the crystals cream	14
1	this shaver has met all my expectations it cleans and recharges itself automatically the shave is close and nick free the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes	14
1	i ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well pleased it is much less expensive than comparable walkers the cushioned seat and basket are handy for long trips and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas a good buy for someone looking for a quality walker even ships for free	14
1	i have fought with my naturally curly crazy hair for all of my life i have tried more products that i care to mention but i do love this product ! it truly delivers what it promises frizz free loose non stiff curls ! i just get out of the shower towel dry very lightly put it on and voila ! makes my curls looks sexy !	14
1	my husband is in love with this razor ! he thought he was a norelco only fan until i bought him this model for christmas i purchased it due to the great reviews it received both from consumers and independent reviewers and also b c it cost less than 40 it leaves his face so smooth whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days in fact he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn highly recommended	14
0	the size is good but the second one we ordered leaked the cap did not fit the after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container warmer which costs only 6 10 dollars in the market around too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product	14
1	i purchased this for my wife for christmas and she loves it as do i it is n't too 'perfume y' and smells terrific	14
0	very simple review the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month then it did n't save your box if you buy this you may need to return it	14
0	i found this razor as the same as the other ones do n't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one the only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose et	14
1	i have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette it has a light almost woodsy smell reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something classy yet sporting	14
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle it has no flavor i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !	14
1	i bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser \( well the pink one was my idea \) and this is by far the best product i 've ever used i even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great and it 's usually a nappy tangled mess after i work out there really is nothing better than the chi for straight silky hair i 've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it it 's worth the price	14
1	this scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office easy to monitor weight and fat	14
0	the mirror 's light is quite dim and the magnification \( 5x \) is inadequate for most purposes	14
1	i was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway it does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed this has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it 's time to give in and buy a new one	14
0	the brababy does not function as claimed the wholething came apart with the first wash this device isway too flimsy	14
0	the scale is already broken it just reads lo when you step on it and i just got it a couple of weeks ago it worked for about a week and a half	14
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them i am very disappointed the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste it 's very hard to clean it 's loud and small brush not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive no thank you	14
0	good scale could have been better designe for feet fat measurement pretty close	14
0	i bought this item and had it shipped to a friend out of state it never worked she replaced the batteries when it arrived but that did n't help it was a complete waste of time and money	14
0	perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better my recommendation is do not buy	14
0	this thing messed up my back it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it furthuremore it smells terrible do not buy this product you will regret it \( shipping was n't bad	14
1	i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using he has been enjoying the features offered by this device he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints it was a great price for a quality product	14
1	i purchased this unit for my personal office at work its small and unobtrusive enough so as not to necessarily stand out its runs quietly and well operating on the highest setting for several hours	14
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving and when it does it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving i do n't think it hurts much though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily i am very happy with this product	14
1	received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option shop rite sells individual box for 8 99 so even the regular price of 32 beat that the 10 additional promotion was icing on the cake	14
0	i bought it new after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower it stopped working i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior including the electronics they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower i have not opened the shaver i have not cleaned it in water thus based on my experience this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	14
1	these are marvelous ! ! i had gotten a different style last february for mothers these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids i love the snap strap and the pouch now all of my children want them too ! ! also love the up to date colors !	14
1	clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you your family and the enviroment	14
0	the bed lift system is ok if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read however i did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you were n't centered in the bed	14
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas to my knowledge he has used it only once with no complaints was nice for the main reason he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it purchasing was a breeze thank yo	14
1	these are a helpful item for me the cloth pockets are nice and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple	14
1	i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time	14
0	it ran good and i liked the different attachments but i gave it away because i was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did	14
1	smaller size did not fit me or my son it would be nice if you could use perhaps a hat size to determine right size standard size worked fine	14
0	this hair dryer was purchased as a christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years i could not locate one locally so i order from amazon the dryer only worked for a few days nothing i do will make it work again the reason i have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much	14
1	my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would n't want this new much more attractive kind it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large we put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great what more can you ask	14
0	did not work at all i used cheaper products that i bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them since princereigns promised to be a miracle product i bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them complete waste of money	14
0	i got this as a gift for my husband he used it for about 3 weeks but still had red marks and had to follow up afterwards with a regular disposable razor the whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and was n't as good luckily braun had a 30 day money back guarantee so we were able to return it \( minus shipping x 2 \)	14
0	this hair dryer did dry my hair quickly but it quit working after a month i exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later the buttons were also hard to switch this was a waste of money i ended up buying a completely different hair dryer	14
1	i love these luvs ! they are remarkably thin easy to pull out of the wipe warmer yet still very durable and pliable however they are also remarkably difficult to find locally so buy in bulk when you can find them	14
0	now i try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum like in tea i do not drink coffee so when i took stacker 3 \( just one pill \) i was jittery and could not fall asleep i stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day i felt nauseus too now this was probably because i do n't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it but i do n't recommend stacker 3 anyway	14
0	these glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest poorly made and most awkward glasses i have ever tried on they are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store pure garbage do n't waste your money i ca n't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner	14
0	i was very eager to use this product i had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and i thought this would be a great replacement i was a little disappointed when i had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before i could get full power my disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses we can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle i had big hopes for this product but all i got was a big disappoinment	14
1	i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it so now i'm buying her one for her new ap	14
1	i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer i found it easy to use and accurate however after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor and that was it it no longer works i will probably buy another one but it needs to be treated with kid gloves	14
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
0	this product does not make you hair grow at all im so freakin mad it is such a lie it makes your hair grow im soooooooooooo madddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd	14
0	this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it very bad investment	14
1	i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth it 's a bit louder than the older model probably because it 's got an additional motion and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light overall just what we wanted	14
1	very nice trimmer my hat off to remington i have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard it words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers	14
0	made of cheap plastic generate loud noise the switch broke off the 2nd week i got it	14
0	i was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it	14
0	original purchase had two dead batteries then a replacement set had the same results it 's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order but the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low made in china	14
1	these glasses are a great idea however they do not work with long hair the back strap of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose \( so you can see over them for distance \) long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes i guess most people who need reading glasses do n't have long hair	14
1	just love the homedic foot bath easy to use and very ssothingon the feet the pedicure attachments are a plus the price was just great !	14
0	nice idea for all of us office workers but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support furthermore the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support i am looking for something else	14
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we 're yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it 's been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor	14
1	i 've used this for quite some time now and really like it i do n't have the trouble with the toilet flushing that others seem to but i suppose if you have one of those one gallon regulated toilets you 'd probably have some trouble with this paper it is thicker and tons softer but it does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses running cat 's eyes cleaning the bathroom sink mirror you name it it 's pretty strong stuff and i highly recommend it	14
1	this give an excellent finish to a shave i strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well apply hot water to dilate your pores then apply the oil then shaving cream shave and finally the after shave balm the oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience your face feels incredibly smooth afterward i do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone but i do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after	14
0	i'm not sure if i just received a defective pen or what happened my general experience with cross pens has been very positive this one however is awful it does n't write smootly and leaves ink everywhere	14
1	it is a great product and makes my husband 's face as smooth as a baby 's you know	14
0	before the very first filter ever even finished it started to crack all over cheap produc	14
1	finally tried this and i definitely recommend it it doesnt have a strong smell very pleasant and neutral it feels so good on your skin after you shave very soothing and moisturizing try some you 'll love it	14
0	what a disappointment the reviewer who mentioned the difficult to use switch was right it was a poor design choice needlessly heavy too with poor balance	14
1	i love that stuff ! and now you have n't had it but i need more please make it available again thanks	14
1	this product works well it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going	14
0	though the description of this product says it 's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat i used them once and then packed them away because i do not like the odor i wish the mitts had been unscented perhaps over time or by next winter the odor will be gone and i 'll get some use out of them	14
1	i purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two inch threshold to our house and it has done that but i wish now that i had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline i use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair 's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house it was easy to install however with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable	14
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially but also in your neck and feet your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane	14
0	what a disappointment ! the device just was n't predictable sometimes it would do as expected sometimes not it was just a crapshoot finally unplugged it and it 's in a drawer somewhere yes i played with the sensitivity with no success getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince the clapper to do its thing save your money and look elsewhere	14
0	tried this product for 2 weeks it did improve the clarity and softness but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well seemed to have a sticky feel since then i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare this product performs like magic it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush i can do the treatment 2 3x 's a week \( like your supposed to \) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before it is a magical product bette hampton chicago i	14
1	i recently started weight watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale i figured i would buy a ww product but after reading the reviews i decided to go with the omron scale i am very pleased with this product it has been extremely accurate it keeps a history for both my husband and i i would highly recommend this scale to anyone ! it is also an attractive scale which is a bonus go with the omron scale	14
1	good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu	14
1	overall an excellent trimmer this is what i have been needing all of these years finally a piece of equipment that does it all i have been very pleased with this trimmer it is solid and cuts without problem i love the adjustments and the removeable head thanks remington and my wife for the christmas present	14
1	although the compartments seem small you can fit lots of food into this bowl it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections so you can separate your veggies meat etc the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break \( so i use it to store food in the fridge i have all of the other fit fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken	14
1	pedometer is great ! easy to use accurate highly recommend it	14
1	i have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries \( 6 two packs \) and i must say that they work exactly how i projected them to they hold a charge well enough for my uses in various electronics and my infant 's papasan swing regular duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days these batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and i have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss i am very pleased so far with my purchase get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size d become easily available and cheaper	14
0	i bought this hairdryer and it worked really well for one week but then it just died on me one week	14
1	i got this showerhead for christmas and am really happy with it ! ! it 's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you i do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place but with mine anyways it stays in place while i'm using it and it 's only later that it slowly lowers down then i just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when i want to use it it has n't been any trouble so far i love this showerhead so much that i'm actually already looking for an even larger one ! ! i highly recommend these rainfall showerheads !	14
1	i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago the pain was gone after the first night and it has n't come back since then it supports my neck perfectly i highly recommend	14
0	i found this item to be equal to the conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money	14
1	this is a great product a friend told me about it i finally decided to get one i had bleeding gums in two weeks of regular use bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great just be careful when using the water jet side you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth or it will spray all over the place	14
1	saved my love life literally it worked for me in a couple days and though its a tad pricey well worth the money doesnt burn or sting either if only all other stuff i used worked this good i coulda had a date to the prom cause i tried everything thanks princereign	14
1	my grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist i started to use it and fell in love with it i have suffered with acne my entire life and i have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically i have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night these both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics which has been a problem due to my skin texture	14
1	i loved it and guys really love it the smell is so fresh and clean	14
1	clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture	14
1	panasonic makes a great electric shaver this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years	14
0	broke after two uses not worth the time to put back together	14
0	i ordered this item for my husband and i was extremely disappointed it is poorly made and basically is not worth the money i do not recommend it at all	14
0	this is a very lousy product the lighting around the mirror is absolutely useless when you turn the light on it seems like you 're still looking at the mirror with no light awful product eventhough it 's cheap but it does n't even worth a dime	14
0	this cannot be the real thing the scent does n't last 5 minutes what a waste of 50 00 i am so disappointed	14
1	nizoral anti dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product i noticed a difference the first time i used it there was no residue on my scalp and my flakiness was greatly reduced it produced a very rich lather also the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen i myself am sensitive to many products and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo i would recommend this product to others	14
0	i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w o the wet on off feature over this one it does n't clamp down well on my hair \( i 've got thick frizzy hair \) the results for me are n't that great it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy it 's lightweight which is nice i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair i definitely prefer other models over this one	14
0	i bought this press to do crafts the dimensions i were given were completely wrong i was told the product in inches \( l x w x h \) 9 0 x 20 0 x 15 0 it really is barely 6 1 2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long 17 inces long at the angle it was so small that i could maybe iron one sock at a time also the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website	14
1	i absolutely love this stuff i would recommend this to any person that has frizz it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe i started using it about 2 months ago and cannot stand to go without it just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and do n't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason i tried the chi silk infusion because i thought they would be the same since they are both made by farouk but the chi is not nearly as good i would give this 100 stars i could	14
1	i love the medi beads products and highly recommend them although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto gel i love the moist heat and the weight of the pads i used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients i only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back but 2 of the king sized pads will do it microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave	14
1	i got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base the charger part of the trimmer is just too big even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments he would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for	14
0	maybe it 's my own fault but i did n't get that from the product description it 's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips in my apartment it barely lasts through one night it 's also really noisy i am probably comparing to my last \( normal sized \) humidifier \( a vicks something or other no longer available \) which was great and lasted 3 years until hard water built up too much limescale i would have cleaned more if i 'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it	14
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she is able to do her nail easily the nail attachments work really well and strong the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone compact size easy to store and quick charge time	14
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now but i would not reccomend this one	14
0	this product might do for a backpacking weekend with the boy scouts but compared to a blade razor or even an electric it leaves a lot to be desired i recommend giving it a pass	14
1	alka seltzer got it right and in a big way drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment i prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus	14
1	i use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool i purchased works great !	14
1	this is the 3rd or 4th time i have bought this type of batteries and i am always satisfied with their performance they are a great value	14
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks with nimh rechargable batteries installed and it performs as advertised there is in my opinion a design flaw the start stop button acts as the power on off function and is easily depressed at unwanted times e g putting into or removing from the case they could should have included an ac adapter	14
1	this is the best dispenser we have used it attches to the wall easily is eay to fill and is constructed in such a way that it has multiple uses we purchased smaller ones to give as gifts knowing others would like it also	14
0	i have never used such an impactless \( if that is a word \) product there is absolutely no effect whatsoever not even remotely it is simply a waste of money and bottle i am terribly disappointed you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect	14
0	if you think you are buying the old met rx bars by the same flavors you are in for a very very bad surprise the old bars had better taste and a almost cake like consistency these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one also i could n't get past the taste even the color is different i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day \( years ago \) i gave the entire box away for free i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe	14
1	if you own one of these shavers then you need to replace with these every year buy the best buy these and shaver will stay like new	14
0	i bought this from qvc after i had to send back a braun silk epil the epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness waxing just hurts too much and is really messy this sounded ideal i just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks and upper lip it trims down your facial hair however the next day you will notice stubble you have to really look close to see it but you can really feel it you might as well shave i have not used the brow attachment i saw the demo on qvc but am afraid i will shave my brows off would love to know what others think of this item	14
0	this pad barely got warm it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried i suspect it is n't defective but intentional probably for legal reasons but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it \? \?	14
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick even in the middle of the holidays i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed	14
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer it never brushed well the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly i just never felt i was getting a good brush after using this brush for about a couple of months i went in for a regular checkup my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better that 's all the testimony i need	14
1	i loved this product really leaves my hair really straight without even blow drying ! ! i have curly hair and it worked pretty well my hair was smooth and shiny i'm very happy with my straightener	14
1	maybe because i ordered a medium it works fine otherwise i recommend it	14
1	this parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come it has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it ! it is by far in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo ! i give this bold majesty of the monarchy the \( il duce \) ! five stars	14
1	product is exactly what you would expect i have been using it for 2 months 3 5 times a day with great success i would buy it again knowing how well it works	14
1	just bought this showerhead i have a stand up shower built in with a pull around curtain all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor this is the one it works great i have a shallow well pump with 40 60lbs of water pressure setting my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub	14
0	ordered this item on sept 28 they were supposed to ship it within 1 week after 1 week i received an email they said they needed 2 more weeks another email today \( nov 7 \) they think they can deliver it by november 27 that 's 2 months after i placed my order at this point i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year fortunately with amazon they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order which is what i am going to do right now	14
1	these are a great yuumy snack for someone who counts calories \( or points \) it 's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great ! i have never met a luna bar i did n't like though this is my favorite flavor	14
1	this writting instrument is superb in it 's ability to compensate the energetic writer	14
1	i 've tried a lot of different nutrition and energy bars and these are my favorites \( along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry \) great taste a nice texture \( sort of like nestle crunch \) and much more satisfying than candy bars almost as tasty as girl scout thin mints but not as fat and guilt inducing	14
1	i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep	14
1	good product does what it says however it could smell better it has almost no scent you smell clean but it has almost no scent other than that it feels great lathers great leaves your skin feeling nice and it clears your skin up	14
0	i like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper so i bought tushies when my baby was newborn they seemed to work ok maybe because she did n't put out that much she is now three months old i practice attachment parenting so i know exactly when she has a bowel movement the past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly she was sitting on my lap she had a bowel movement five seconds later i got up to change her the feces was all over my pants this has happened several times the concept of the diaper is great but the diaper needs some work around the legs	14
0	i'm sorry that i ordered these online i should have tried them first they do not fit round heads no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit the bow needs to have an adjustment too the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off would not buy another pair	14
0	as i found it to be really much too fake lemony not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms i mixed mine w a subtle cookie type one i coud n't smell at all now can smell neither even when i put them in closets which was not the idea i like a little fragrance thru the house may look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood	14
0	there are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff it 's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin c a completely pathetic rip off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices if you want an energy drink try rockstar or monster if you want to support the troops buy a savings bond	14
0	this is an expensive fanny pack not impressed to enough room for diapers etc	14
0	my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur	14
0	if i had saved the box i would have returned this product the head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked and it wasnt just one shower i tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes	14
1	i have two penguin humidifiers which i purchased a couple of months ago for the money i think these are great and simple to use i did not have any problems with leakage the key is to make sure that the top is on securely also some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base just carry a washcloth with you no problem super quiet i think it is just the right size for a bedroom easy to clean and fill i had tried others \( honeywell and vicks \) and this is by far my favorite	14
1	dr scholl 's foot cream was excellent it 's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell my feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and i noticed a difference immediately in my dry cracked heels i also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before i went to bed especially my hands were really soft in the morning i 've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed but i think the difference is that dr scholl 's has no alcohol in it and it 's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin	14
1	i am totally satisfied with thids product so far of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few charges i will be dissatisfied i expect them to last tens of reusses if experience can be of any guideline	14
1	i bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower tub combo he loves it esp the height adjustment feature	14
1	i 've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works never falls apart and cut hair great i 'd buy another if this one would ever wear out !	14
0	it warms ok not great but the worst thing is the massage is loud ! i work at home in my basement where it gets cold and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm and was excited to get massage too however i ca n't use the massage feature while i am on the phone it is way too loud and there is no control on the heating element just on and off a disappointment i still use the heat feature but also wear thick socks	14
0	shaker is adequate for breaking down whey but it leaks i always have to wash my hands and the outside of the bottle after making anything with it	14
1	these are the best nursing pads out there i tried several others that would not stick and would leak i 've never had any problems with these	14
0	the razor is n't bad but the cleaning system is a joke mine would n't release the razor kept recleaning it plus and i am surprised that this is n't mentioned in the other reviews that i read before getting the razor the cleaning solution \( which is an expensive printer ink type of gimmick \) stinks like metal solvent bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price	14
1	this edger is a perfect match with the wahl beard mustache trimmer you can do a real professional job with these two items robert paul jone	14
1	this eyeliner really matches the description it goes on super smooth and does n't tug or drag i was told at the counter that it was water resistant but it 's really not i used to wear it under my lower eyelashes but by the end of the day it would be totally smudged and gross i would even try to put powder over it but to no avail however in defense of laura i am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes are n't friendly to many pencil eye liners i was just hoping against hope that laura 's would be different ! so now i only use it over the upper lid	15
1	this is the best perfume that i have ever used i tried estee lauder lancome and i always come back to paloma the scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time buy it today	15
1	if you have smooth skin this product is not for you my skin had no human quality about it after i went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments i suffer from extreme skin dryness uneven and dull skin other lotions made my face look greasy or failed to give it that moisturised look i have tried many products for my extreme dry dull skin issues and this is the first product that has worked for me now my skin looks hydrated and normal it is quite a feat	15
0	if you have some respect for your nose please do n't buy these wipes ! ! ! i bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house ! ! ! and i would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
1	i have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them i 've tried different brands and always come back to this one they have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too powdery	15
1	i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen up mist i have normal type hair that needs to be washed every other day and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day i have very sensitive skin too this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry and it feels awesome on my skin well done jonathan	15
1	this mascara goes on like a dream and stays put throughout the day without tearing or irritation your lashes will look like they belong in an advertisement	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
1	i love this shampoo it make my hair so soft and shiny i cut the shampoo in four and use it every other day then i keep it at dry place this shampoo last long too the smell is great too love it ! i'm going to buy it for my mom	15
1	it 's interesting to see all of the oil that this takes from your face it really shows on the paper and it does it 's job not as cheap as washing your face but more fun	15
1	i have purchased many different brow pencils over the years and finally found one that is truly wonderful ! the color is perfect and the application is easy and the results are phenomenal the bourjois precision eyebrow pencil is the best i 've ever used i highly recommend it also the brow brush that comes attached to the cover is very nice and leave the brows looking 'finished' and natural i have senitive skin and had absolutely no problems with this product	15
1	i like to eat avocados i like avocado face masks and now i can bathe in eau de avocado ! this bath bomb is possibly my favorite very softening great color \( turns your tub into a nice green lagoon \) and great lemony scent i did n't find the glitter to be very noticeable so do n't worry about that stock up on this one	15
1	this product made my skin look absolutely great ! i use it twice a day and within one week i saw a huge difference i 've been now using murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing i get compliments on my skin every day i highly recommend it	15
0	i ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website however i have n't wanted to use this product much due to it 's odor very medicinal chemical smelling makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face ! i used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and did n't notice any difference in my skin i would n't recommend this product unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it	15
1	my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i 've used it ever since it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good just a little of biosilk goes a long way gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair i definitely reccomend it	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
0	i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you ca n't smell a thing yes the scent is great i love it but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me really really disapointed i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines they are quality and can last most of the day this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days	15
1	only drawback it stays wetter onyour face prior to shaving than the competitive stuffi e afta which dries quickly so youcan get to shaving quicker	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
1	the wipes work well they do not irritate my daughter 's face but they stink ! ! ! ! ! i usually use them before she goes to bed so that i do n't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous	15
1	this salve is just perfect under bliss 's softening socks it 's amazing how much you can smear on leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks it leaves feet renewed use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies	15
0	i know this is philosophy 's big seller but i hate the way it smells it reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous my husband hated it too as did my son i like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet that is about as close as it gets if you want a good philosophy scent go with falling in love pure grace or philosophy the scent all of them are better than amazing grace i do n't care to smell like a perfumy granny thank you i 'll stick with my falling in love	15
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	15
1	this is not my first purchase from iman cosmetics i love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well i would definitely purchase this powder again	15
0	i'm in my 30 's light skin everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try did n't work for me after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy it 's not what they say it is i 've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body but the skin care products are a scam go for neutrogena or clinique good luc	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works my skin feels softer and looks more even all around	15
0	i received my order and was very dissapointed the skin tones online are deceiving i ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy does n't blend well with skin suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone	15
1	i love these inserts ! i had trouble finding ones this size not too big not too small they definitely help me to fill out my bras ! i would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts i tried just setting these in my bra but if i moved my arms up and my bra moved around i was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out these are a great product though	15
1	this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp very light and smells great	15
1	beyond paradise is a wonderful flirty floral scent that is n't too overpowering i recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine	15
0	i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line along with adoring the amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent boy was i wrong ! ! if you love amazing grace this smells nothing like it it smells like plastic flowers not appealing at all even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic if you want a fantastic exfoliator try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub those are devine ! i think i 'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on	15
1	i bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands hydrated and soft after leaving them on for half an hour with the glamour gloves gel my hands felt reborn i could n't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated i 've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they 're still doing the job i 've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and do n't know how well they work but these are very high quality	15
1	i recently converted to using powder makeup i am hooked i did n't tell anyone i was using it my son was the first person to tell me how nice i looked ! that truly made my day and was all the convincing i needed i absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel goopy like liquid foundation	15
1	t3 is worth every penny it is very easy to handle my hair is soft and shiny no more frizz it cut straightening time to half no hair pulling and it is lightweight plus 2 years of warranty hellooo ! ! ! bye bye chi	15
0	over 1 000 for moisturizing cream \? as the saying goes a fool and their money are soon parted	15
1	well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there the smell is chrisp and will last a long time it is a great cologne for any acasion i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it ! ! ! !	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
1	this product is fantastic ! i use it for my daughter who has very thick beautiful and coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it is not unmanageable and leaves it shiny and soft this works well with the hair balm ! !	15
1	i was so surprised by this eyeshadow i usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when i tested this on my hand i had to have it ! be mine is a light shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft smooth and lightweight that it glides on and does n't look cakey since i bought this i hardly wear any of the cheap stuff i own this is worth the price and now i'm saving up to buy a few more shades	15
1	this products delivers what it promises i bought it as part of the makeup optional kit and now i am ordering 2 so that i do n't run out my skin is missing it so badly i discovered good skin i never knew i could have so i must have this product the antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin this is my favourite then secondly the purity made simple third the hope is not enough spf cream	15
1	soft sensual made me feel feminine and attractive my husand agrees	15
1	inis has a very fresh crisp clean scent that i love it 's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering which is what i like about it it 's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it whenever i wear it people always sniff and make comments like what are you wearing \? and mmm ! you smell so good	15
0	i was n't really thrilled with this product it smells great but as soon as the shower is over the thrill is gone	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
1	i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth after a week the breakouts went away \( they were minor \) and all i can say is wow my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc etc i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products	15
1	i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho hum scent this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product	15
1	yum ! fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever i use this it smells wonderful deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge this shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin i do n't like it as a shampoo as much when i do use it to wash my hair i'm sure to follow up with a conditioner it 's a delightful product and i'm pleased with my purchase	15
1	i absolutely love this scent i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you 'll love this	15
1	this foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look while also giving a good coverage i 've been using this foundation for years all year long and it is one of my favorites not too heavy and not too light it 's the perfect foundation being asian american and with a light complexion finding a good color match had always been a problem unless i spent 40 for a bottle of makeup zhen is one of the best deals around clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside	15
0	i found this product did absolutely nothing for me granted i do n't have huge wrinkles but the few i do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse ! i wish i had asked around from friends cause if i had i would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money i'm wondering a couple of things what all the fuss is about with strivectin \? is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some do n't \? and is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that really works \? \( if it works i do n't mind spending the money	15
1	no wonder this is a bestseller ! the results are highly visible and real fast i noticed a change in my skin 's pigmentation just a few days after using it highly effective i recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality product and tired of just fancy labels and marketing	15
1	this lip gloss is so wonderful i do n't know where to start long lasting shine perfect color goes on smooth does n't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do mild fruity flavor i highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone the expense is worth it 100x over	15
1	i am seeing results after three weeks i love this stuff	15
1	i love jonathan products and especially how it makes my hairfeel so soft and sexy looking keep up the good work jonathan	15
1	blackberry bath bomb is really relaxing it turns the water a pretty purple color and smells sleepily sweet it 's fairly moisturizing too	15
0	i read the label and it is not a rare tropical oil at all but plain old american palm oil ! false advertising really bothers me it did condition my hair well but i agree that the fragrances \( which are added to it by the way \) make the odor very strong and unpleasant the price is also very high i will not order this again	15
0	this product did not dry my hair as described on the box it did straighten my hair but that was all i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it	15
1	wow ! my husband and i both use this scrub it is very refreshing the salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour ! like the previous review i feel the chill after getting out of the shower then i was full of energy ! i look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work ! this will be a staple in our household !	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
1	foams nicely in the tub rinses away cleanly skin is n't left with any film instead your skin is left very soft and with a good scent falling in love smells sweet and relaxing and makes me think of cotton candy the large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower	15
1	this smells so wonderful ! wear it and you will get compliments it seems like it might be a summertime only scent \( i e very tropical \) but i 'd wear it year round i only wish they made a larger size in the oil	15
0	i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids i was really bummed out try the cinnamon buns it is so much better	15
1	i like that the gloss is n't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you do n't get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i was n't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but do n't know if i 'd buy it again	15
0	i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it 's definitely not for me in any way it 's very drying on my skin even though it 's thick and creamy the label says it 's award winning but does n't state what award it 's received \( if any ! \) i fail to see what might warrant it being award winning the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy also it 's absurdly priced given the quality i 've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed	15
1	this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright shiny hair for me i have nice hair to begin with \( if i do say so myself \) but i used this in conjunction with one of lush 's conditioners \( american cream \) and my friends told me i had shampoo model hair that day i'm not crazy about the beer ish smell which is why i 'll give it a four rating however it does n't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it	15
1	this is a great prodduct at a reasonable price whenever i need these i order and the arrive timel	15
1	ooohh sparklies ! ! ! ! ! you can put this on your face make you very much pretty turn the heads of boy types stops traffic ! !	15
1	not as much coverage as i would like for my mildly ruddy complexion but it definitely smoothes out skin texture and moisturizes very well	15
0	at 23 i do n't have age wrinkles around my eyes but i have laugh lines that i want to soften this product has done nothing for my laugh lines i could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines this product did not	15
0	i received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of my boys the sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length re lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn the scent does n't remind me of vanilla grapefruit more like plain burning sticks which wo n't cost you 13 votivo does candles well but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired not worth the money	15
1	this stuff is amazing i use candle light underneath my eyes and around my brows it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long it 's especially beautiful in sunlight really makes my blue eyes pop !	15
0	jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you ca n't fool them twice i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
0	not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome 's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice	15
1	i find these soaps to be very good there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan if they are to drying try using the correct soap for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep \? it lasts until the next afternoon it 's not even just a weak scent that 's left on you it 's like as if you 've been spraying it constantly but here 's the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it 's great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this is n't the product for you	15
1	i have never found a compact foundation cream or powder that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it until now this is an amazing makeup and the best part is that it does n't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage my skin tends to be red but this does n't even hint at it plus it 's a nice matte without being too dry for everyday this is my time saving face perfecting miracle	15
1	i love auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume pink sugar to death but it is such an overpowering scent that i am often smelled before i am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate aquolinas new perfume chocolovers is similarly sweet but much subtler if you love the sweet scent of pink sugar but do n't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away try chocolovers	15
1	i use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products having bleached hair i did n't think i 'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until i discovered these products they are worth their weight in gold ! they leave my hair soft manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful	15
1	ok i have really large lips and for years i have tried everything to protect them get this tin for some reason the stick does n't work as well and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day it 's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily trust me i have tried everything even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt	15
0	beware ! it is a fake not a real genuine mac lipstick do not buy the amplified creme from this seller he has only fakes amplified cremes i got a few	15
0	i can truly say that this products does n't work i have silky wavy fine hair and i am a hair food junkie so i used a lot of things but this do n't work usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard matted and tangled carol daughter 's products may work for some but it has n't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures	15
0	this product did not live up to jonahan 's claims on the bottle i cannot even begin to describe how bad it was and how it did not work nor live up to his promise	15
1	i have tried every lip plumper on the market \( no joke \) and this is the best \( besides pure cinnamon leaf oil which burns like hell \) i use b e products and i bought a couple of these bc i liked the colors i was not expecting it to work as well as it did now it is all i use on my lips ! it makes your lips feel cool not burning	15
1	i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this product although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there this product is great totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne yes it 's pricey but i think it 's worth every penny	15
0	this product did not dry my hair as described on the box it did straighten my hair but that was all i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it	15
1	i liked this product so much i'm buying some for my family members who live out of town ! only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft shiny and moisturized and it 's great on my ends especially with roller sets ! plus my darling hubby loves the scent i use it along with the khoret amen hair oil	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair will not purchase again	15
1	'do n't know what these others are talking about chocolovers smells yummy ! what 's great about this fragrance is that it 's not overwhelming and it 's not going to make you smell like dessert it 's got chocolatey tones but it 's not just about chocolate it 's warm and musky with orange oil hazlenut vanilla if in doubt you can always go to sephora and try a sample first \( see sephora com for store locations \)	15
1	to be totally honest i'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about but i do know one thing this stuff really works ! after using this for a couple of weeks i started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face it was n't dramatic but i kept using the repair formula and about a month later i could definitely see a difference ! people have commented on the way i look and i recommend it to all of them it just makes your skin look healthier	15
1	i got this as a gift from my mother last year this product saved my hands and feet ! it helped them stay soft no more itchy ankles or knuckles i preferred to use this at night but i do use it on my feet almost everyday before i put my socks on for the day it moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling	15
1	unbelievable results was considering botax when i heard about this product thought to try i have used several other products never saw results like strivectin sd used it as directed mainly between brows on top of the lips and the neck within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck have been using it for over 30 days family and friends are noticing it thank you for a great product got all my friends start using ca n't wait to try the eye cream just heard about it	15
0	i have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit i use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks nothing changed i figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so i continued to use this product \( use the entire jar just to give it plenty of time \) still not difference could be seen for me it was a waste of money	15
1	i first tried amazing grace a couple of years ago at that time i had a dresser full of department store colognes the scent of amazing grace is somehow undescribable suffice it to say it is the perfect fragrance and those other scents are history it is pleasing to the person who wears it and is pleasing to someone just walking by you some perfumes walk into a room before the person does or is so strong it makes other people 's eyes water we 've all been around someone like that not so with amazing grace it is just in harmony with you and those around you	15
0	the texture of this product is fine but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore therefore overpriced now if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag but it does n't smell that great it smells rather like over cooked coffee beans the bare escentuals soy mocha spf 15 has a much nicer smell and texture if you 're wanting a bare escentuals product	15
1	this product actually works as described it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks the scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother i highly recommend this produc	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
1	i 've been using this kit for several weeks now and i am absolutely amazed at the results ! i 've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill i was taking they were bright red and no concealer on the market would cover them after one week of using murad i 've noticed the scars fading ! i thought nothing on this planet would fade them but murad is ! i 've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin murad drastically reduces the amount of shine i have i highly recommend this product to everyone	15
1	there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin you spread a few drops on your face \( and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well \) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup it does not irritate my sensitive skin \( i have rosacea and seb derm \) or clog my pores a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money	15
0	bought this to help myself achieve some punch with my existing waves all i got were crimps in wierd places found the instruction booklet completely not useful i tried and tried but could not produce anything remotely close to a wave curl etc save your money	15
0	poor quality construction the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use plus it was much rougher than something like loofah you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that	15
1	i had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months i decided to go to the counter at the bloomingdale 's near my house the sa at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me i was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime i took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on not only that but it is long lasting and does n't crease i may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	i have tried many different products and this one is the best i rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else i have tried four stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it you can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem especially if under makeup	15
0	i was really excited for this ! i hoped it would be a faster easier way to do make up and what not but its not it smears like crazy and the end is so sharp it hurts to apply but that does n't matter ! the end stops working after a use or two i suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes \( for the black is more navy then black \) you 'll be happy i 've always loved the mark products but this is a disappointment	15
1	the best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent apply and leave on the skin for about 20 30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly then you start shaving it 's great because you do n't feel the razor on the skin as much which makes shaving quite pleasant i 've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is anthony logistics which i do n't think as nice as philosophy common man a little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long i would buy this again	15
1	as we 've heard it 's not easy being green it 's more than easy it 's delightful if you 're an avobath bath ballistic infused with avocado \( hence the name \) and olive oil it moisturizes skin the fragrance is fresh rather citrusy thanks to lemongrass and rosewood bath water is a lovely shade of green rather like new spring grass if there 's glitter in it i did n't find any which was as i wished it 's suggested for morning i 'd relax with an avobath any time of day	15
1	i have this lip gloss in sweetie and will be trying other shades i am very pleased with it ! i wear it over stay on type lip colors in other brands and it keeps my color on all day \( even after eating \) ! it does n't really feel too sticky if you blot after application i only wish it tasted as good as it smells \( not that it tastes bad it 's just blah \) !	15
1	i just got out of the shower a minute ago and i must say this is the best shampoo i 've ever bought my scalp has n't felt this clean and fresh in a long time washing my super thick and waist length hair did n't feel like a chore for once and i actually look forward to my next washing the smell reminds me of the hippie shops on haight street in san francisco i love it	15
0	this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses this scent does n't linger and is too subtle not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil i do n't recommend this unless you are 16 and under i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it	15
1	this is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from cargo i would very much recommend it the lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin the four stars are because i love smelly things and this one just smells like lipstick it could smell yummier i suppose but so far i love it	15
1	naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it lucky for me i like ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby 's butt' \? erm no \? easy simple to use obviously no messing with jars or bottles just go to town massaging those pesky areas i'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise	15
1	i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you	15
1	once again spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is worth it this is the only toner i have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over drying my skin i alternate with 3 depending on the weather	15
1	i am in love with this product it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast \( i probably use more than i need to \)	15
1	subtle yet powerful ! i love this scent i actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance many compliments from men women a little spritz does the trick ! you can also purchase a sheer moisturizing body spray perfect for daytime wear especially during the summer pricey but definately worth it ! !	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
1	much better in terms of coverage than the new loreal makeup that diane keaton touts which is more creamy but just does n't cover as well avon 's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but does n't block my pores i highly recommend it	15
1	this fragrance is both sexy and playful it truly embodies the essence of a woman both men and women find it to be a truly amazing scent	15
1	murad promises the miracle cure for acne while the product is good it 's not a miracle i 've been usines murad for two months and while my skin has improved it 's not flawless i still get break outs and they still take a while to heal i 'll keep using it because it 's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows maybe my skin will improve	15
1	to tell you the truth i have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz nothing really worked at all but biosilk is a miracle ! the first time i tried it i noticed a major difference in my hair just add a little bit to your hair and it will immediately smooth it out adding shine and softness it will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy just do n't use that much of it i mostly use this with my flat iron and i get amazing results i happen to like the smell of it it reminds me of being in a salon ! try the shampoo and conditioner as well	15
0	it could cover the tattoo but after while it fails not fully invisible	15
0	i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving the product claims to reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps ingrown hairs and redness from shaving but despite it 's lofty promises and high price it does none of this in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol the directions tell you to apply it after shaving but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving it only made my problem worse i wish i could have rated this product zero stars because it is absolutely worthless	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	this is a great cleaner but i 'd suggest getting the anthony algae cleanser first this glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave but overdries it is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
1	this is my favorite soap in the world a new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks and the scent lingers on my skin as well the soap is gentle and long lasting i recommend it highly	15
1	this product is great ! ! ! i wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when i put a drop or two on at bedtime one night i was really beat too beat to wash my face so i tried putting a little on over everything instead it worked great when i wear it at night my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like i'm 19 again ! \( i'm almost 40 ! \) i ca n't say that everyone will have the same results i do all i know is that i am very very happy to have found this product !	15
0	that 's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it i bought the whole set as i am a sandalwood fanatic i could n't have been more disappointed this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood a complete waste of money	15
1	i am a huge fan of the creme but not of this lip balm for the price they want this should 've been much much better it goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok my l'occitane lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does save your money and do not buy this	15
1	this scent is so clean and not over powering ! i love this product ! it lasts too ! there 's really no need to reapply	15
1	i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it 's ust glittery but i love i	15
1	i have been using this mascara for years i have tried other brands drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else i have ever tried why \? this mascara is smooth it does not flake off and fall into your eyes it does not ever look clumpy it is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes i would not say that this mascara will make your lashes a mile long or dangerously thick or whatever hype you hear from other brands those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara just a simple nice natural looking mascara that wo n't irritate your eyes	15
1	this is the one for you i love love love lavender and this soap is it concentrated lavender goodness very dark purple in color and complex in scent layering wonderful light texture to soap	15
1	i was very pleased with this purchase the perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than i expected 1 oz to be i love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone ! great experience with amazon	15
1	i recently discovered benefit products this is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin i use it to highlight my cheek bones you can use it any where you want a glance to linger the best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin i suggest you try this product it works wonders	15
0	the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all it gets a little cold but warms up in about 45 seconds i also noticed very little over all effects from using it	15
1	smells great ! not too harsh on my thin but long hair	15
0	i bought this from sephora it left my hair a greasy mess and i have dry coarse hair it was very greasy and did n't rinse out well at all	15
1	so i 've been wanting this particular fragrance for a long time now and my boyfriend finally purchased it for me for christmas it arrived on time with no problems and also came along with various perfume samples what can i say \? it was exactly i expected to be no disappointments	15
0	like said in an earlier review after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you ca n't see a thing in it in the shower i run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes then you ca n't clear it with any method total waste not worth a dollar	15
1	do n't be afraid to smile and do n't cover up those smile lines you can eliminate them with this amazing product from clinique	15
0	the texture of this cleanser is waxy i could barely get it off my face and i broke out badly after using it i double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser and that i had n't mistakenly put some other product on my face it smells wonderful though i tried to think of alternate uses for the product but finally threw it away	15
0	this product costs 10 times more then a regular gel but it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face it did not help at all no doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the marketing department because it fooled me just like it fooled everyone 18 for a gel ! it must be more effective i 'll give it a try there is a sucker born every day jose' \( sucker	15
0	used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had not recommended at least for medium wavy hair no frizz control	15
1	lancome 's juicy tubes in simmer tastes like my beverage of choice orange julius when you apply it it feels like you 're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips \( minus the cold minus the cream \) the color is a very subtle pink ish beige but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a simmer ! this is my 4th tube of juicy \( also a big fan of spring fling berry bold \) and so far this is my favorite flavor	15
1	the first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus it 's yummy and fresh and sexy then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in this is a wonderful fragrance for men both of vera wang 's fragrances \( for men and women \) are top quality multi layered emminently pleasing and would make fabulous gifts buy this for your man and enjoy	15
1	this is not sticky lip gloss the rose tone is easy to wear it's sweet and natural tone you can mix colors and than create new color on your lips ! ! you don't need to shop tons of glosses and lip sticks this is it ! plus the palette case is cute	15
1	this oil smells so good i just love it all of my friends say i smell so good	15
1	i absolutely love this kit i love that i can use the great mystery every morning and it is n't harsh on my skin and i love using the greatest love at night and when i wash it off it just melts into my skin i do n't even have to put on a moisturizer for something really nice try using the great mystery and then put the greatest love on top of that it 's really amazing the only caution i would have is when using the greatest love do n't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn	15
1	well i gotta say this one feels goodrefreshing cool calming gives the same feeling you get after you 've just washed your face	15
1	these are just great for cooling of quickly without a sticky feeling unable to find them in the stores	15
0	i fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money save your money trust me ! i used this product 2 3 times a day until the entire tube was gone \( took several months \) and saw no change whatsoever ! i have serious dark circles which is what it claims to help i am very disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again ! what a bunch of crap btw look at all the reviews this product is listed in several places here ! !	15
0	i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh clean scent i was very disapointed when i used it as it reminded me of jean nate which to me is an old lady smell it was more musky than clean smelling i could n't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil that is the only way i can describe it	15
1	this lip gloss smells good goes on slick and stays on a long time great value for the price i love philosophy products they 're all great	15
1	this is one of my favorite perfumes i love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets musk and iris it is a strong smell so go easy on it one spray lasts all day	15
0	i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k y jelly frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams	15
0	you gotta love this woman 's moxy when the high life of being robert prayer requests in the dumpster tilton 's wife evaporated she picked herself right back up and developed a riff of her own selling worthless cosmetics always plenty of suckers to be found	15
1	finish firm hold spray is absolutely perfect for my needs it has a firm hold yet is n't heavy or hard i do n't have a complicated hair style but my hair tends to go flat after just a few hours this product prevents that	15
1	i originally wanted the black ginger aromatic candle but after reading the reviews it seemed that the red currant is the all around favorite the smell is nice but i think i expected something a bit different the candle 's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated and it seems to be burning slowly the candle itself is fine quality and comes packaged nicely ! if i found a scent that i liked a bit better i would be 100 pleased	15
1	i love this soap normally i'm not a bar soap person but this bar really has won me over it smells divine and lasts forever also my skin does n't feel too tight or dry after a bath with this product it is even a pretty color what more could you ask for	15
1	i love this fragance it 's my favorite no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it i love it	15
0	i have an ancient lancome facial brush that i was attempting to replace i bought this brush tried it and went back to my old one in my opinion this brush is far too soft and does n't feel like it is cleaning at all a wash cloth would be better	15
1	this is my all time favorite perfume bar none ! i get millions of compliments when i wear it most people think it smells like baking cookies or marshmallows but not a little girl scent definitely a grown up girl scent men love it because it smells like food a definite turn on ! lol \) you truly cannot go wrong with this perfume it is absolutely faboo	15
0	i use the philosophy 3 in 1 with conditioner it works great and keeps my hair luscious the one time i accidentally bought a 3 in 1 that did n't have conditioner in it my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends after only three applications i had to throw the bottle out i lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair i do n't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality but they do this is one of their better scents however i would recommend using this as a body wash only	15
1	i read many positive \( and very few negative \) reviews before i ordered my first tube i am 65 living in florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months the cream goes on smoothly and i have had no negative reaction friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking with less wrinkles in fact two friends based on my favorable experience are also planning to purchase kinerase	15
1	bobbi brown makes excellent lip colors they are very smooth and have some staying power	15
1	i have ordered a few of these as gifts and the recipients are always delighted responses i have heard about the products are marvelous ! heavenly ! and to die for ! and keep in mind that these are ladies who take there bath times seriously ! ! ! the range of flavors makes it easy to give this gift again and again the order always comes pre wrapped suitable for gift giving you ca n't go wrong with giving this as a gift i give this seller my highest recommendation ! kudos	15
1	i tried the lemon sugar perfume and i am absolutly in love with it it is like no other perfume i have ever smelled before i will probably be using it the rest of my life i hope they never stop making it i think everyone should try it the scent is lemony and sugar just like it says it is light and last a very long time i am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow do not just take my world for it order it today and experience something great and new	15
0	i received this as a gift i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since i only got to use it three times	15
1	this stuff is great i used to buy new gels pommades pastes etc every month because i could never find one that worked exactly how i wanted it to but i first tried this a year ago and it 's all i 've used since and it lasts a long time so do n't be afraid of the price one container lasts me about 6 months so you only have to buy it twice a year i 'll be ordering my third order of it soon	15
1	i experianced a small problem that was completly resolved to my satisfaction what a great company to do buisness with	15
1	i absolutely adore this scent ! it certainly is not just for men ! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this ! the sea salt is amazing ! i literally have n't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person ! never again ! give it a try ! it 'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high	15
0	one i do n't think this is better than botox botox works instantly and more dramatically but it 's more expensive however when you think about how much you 're spending on this strivectin applying it every day for the rest of your life you could get botox \( yes you need to get more botox every several months but the costs are about the same \) not only that but botox simply works better however if you just ca n't afford botox then i would buy rulinea fx which is the exact same ingredients as strivectin but half the price it 's available on hsn co	15
1	this is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer \( hence demon in the dark \) before you put this in the shower cut off the wax then enjoy the tingling soap very invigorating	15
1	i have tried ralph lauren 's romance eau de parfum spray and i love its lush floral scent so romantic and sophisticated i use it only on very special occasions and i 've often been asked what perfume are you wearing \? it smells so good i spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long lasting effect so leave a scent of you behind with ralph lauren romance eau de parfum spray a perfume that means always and forever in bloom wholeheartedly recommended	15
1	i was hooked on sebastian 's shine serum forever then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product it has a nice soft finish so if you like sebastian and redkin 's shine serums you 'll like this i'm not going to go as far as to say it 's a miracle worker it makes your hair shinier it helps a little with my frizz but does n't depouf	15
0	as much as i love fat girl slim i thought i 'd try serious cellulite soap to go with it i was not impressed at all it has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap it was what i thought it would be at all the size of the bar was good the price is good but i am not pleased at all with the quality	15
1	an excellent pair of shears sharp and durable i expect them to last a long time	15
1	having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks i was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores they seem to enlarge as i age came across this product somewhat by accident i was really amazed at how well it works just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth it mattifies the skin all day \( and i have extra oily skin \) other clinique products have made my skin break out but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks highly recommended	15
1	this product is true to its title it is a silk infustion ! ! it made my hair turn from dry and frizzy to silky and soft i hope they do not stop making this product !	15
1	i was unsure about this item in the store but took a gamble i cut 1 3 of the bar up and crumbled it and i was n't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry so i grabbed the rest and tossed it all in wow ! it was so silky and smooth against the skin i jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me ! with some nice classical music on in the background and a tahitian vanilla candle you 'll think your back in the womb all safe and warm the bubbles did n't last very long but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent	15
1	go read the review i wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product cheaper at qvc then amazon like all the other 30 or so products i have shopped around for in the last 6 months go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at amazon ! ! !	15
1	not your typical thick floral smelling perfume this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises like lemon juice mixed with sugar it 's a seasonal perfume \( i ca n't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter \) it smells very crisp fresh and clean which i enjoy a lot but i imagine others would not the same things i like about this perfume could smell like a cleaning product to others go to your fridge get a lemmon squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar if you enjoy the smell you get buy this perfume i highly recommend it if not stick to something more traditional and vanilla floral like ana sui 's dolly girl	15
1	i love this scent it smells warm and spicy on my skin the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful it also lasts all day long which is great because i'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i had an amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on it so happened that i needed new tweezers i read the reviews and thought i 'd give these a try wow i ca n't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers i have ever owned they almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp it is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair tweezerman tweezers rock !	15
1	this tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both as a rn with dermatology experience i have used many tools i like this one as it saves you from bruising or squishing your skin so it solves the problem with a minimum of damage if you have n't used anything like this it may take some getting used to but it 's way better than using your fingers i gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small	15
1	my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid there 's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar i really like that it 's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar it 's great for those who do n't want a flowery bath but who ca n't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar i wish i 'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies plus this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb really probably any bomb would do good stuff	15
1	for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff non greasy no heavy scents it 's worth every penny	15
1	this product is amazing ! i have very dry skin and this just soaks in leaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days i even have used it for my shampoo times with good results there too	15
1	this is not a strong floral fragrance and not sweet but it smells wonderful it just gets better and better on your skin very complex very different	15
1	i received this a a gift for valentine 's day this year it 's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam \( rather than big double bubbles \) it 's chock full of natural ingredients and no sls so it 's very gentle even for little ones i do however prefer the deep steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint	15
1	this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me	15
1	the 2nd day i shampoo d with this bar it was amazing the compliments i received it made my hair right after going to the salon shiny i 'd highly reccomend this to anyone	15
0	i got my bottle of curve today and tried it out my girlfriend said i smelled like dust oops ! too bad they do n't have scratch and sniff on the computer	15
0	this did not help my skin at all i would not reccomend it to anyone ! save your money !	15
1	this is a great finisher use after you 've drenched your hair with leave in conditioner and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape smells great but does n't compete with the smell of other products only con a little bit does not go a long way it 's expensive to stock up	15
1	i got a sample of this conditioner when i bought a similar product by another company i did n't care for the one i purchased but the sample was awesome and i am going to buy the jonathan conditioner i have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products i used this for a week and this is the only thing i have ever seen any kind of difference with i love it !	15
1	very good product and great kind of fruity smell leave hair soft and full of bounce easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long the price here is still more expensive than in europe around 22 euros	15
0	i was soooo excited to get this in the mail i have very oily skin the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed the shipping is insanely high i will stick to mac skincare from now on	15
1	simplify simplify simplify ! that 's what i try to do with my beauty routine hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one step cleanser i'm staying with it because it works no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers one step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished it 's both easy and effective	15
1	i absolutely love the smell of philosophy 's cinnamon buns like the other reviewers have said it does n't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented i only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense i like the other cinnamon buns products also i use the cream and the lip gloss	15
1	i like this scent my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so very fresh and sweet but not too sweet crisp and spring like a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this	15
1	this smells good and the heart shape is cute but it lost it 's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish i liked it but it 's not one of my favorites	15
1	i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously lumpy legs i ca n't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot i 've done weight loss programs before and they 've never addressed the cellulite issue this is the first thing that has seemed to work and it 's great moisturizer too	15
1	i was n't crazy about this mascara when i first put it on but it grew on me the brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however i love it now it brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply they 'll be long and nicely separated and the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day no smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where i feel like it 's a shame to wash my eye makeup off i'm really pleased with it i want to try lancome 's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper	15
1	this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i have n't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i do n't want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and did n't know any better i would probably try to eat it	15
0	i am asian and i have very thick and coarse hair i bought this product due to all the rave but it did nothing for me and it does n't even smell nice after trying numerous products and flat irons i had thermal reconditioning done my hair has never been smoother silkier and so easily manageable no product or styling necessary just wash and go	15
1	after looking and looking for the perfect brown lipstick that was n't red or too dark i tried this and bought it on the spot this is the best color if you 're looking for a shimmer and just enough color this lipstick is n't sticky dry or cakey	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
0	i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer i used just a little bit and it was really greasy i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum it works much better	15
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	15
1	this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important	15
1	ck1 is a very nice toilette spray it has a very good smell to it i gave it as a gift and now i am going to have to purchase it for me to	15
0	on a scale of 1 to 5 the packaging gets a negative 1 you ca n't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle ended up removing top for value of product jonathan gets a 1 for quality of product 3 the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter need to use more than average the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair but no better than other quality brands i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time but bed head has a similar product that 's been out for a while for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price	15
1	this stuff goes on easy stays well \( but will rub off with water wo n't withstand a good cry \) nice not quite as nice as the victoria 's secret liner \( i swear by that stuff discontinued 3 4 years ago \) but way better than anything cheaper i have tried other things plus wo n't irritate my very sensitive eyes	15
1	if you have n't tried lush or creamy candy do it ! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft for soap to match try rock star mmmmm ! ! ! i ca n't place the fragrance it 's cherry but not cotton candy but not it 's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts enjoy	15
1	i thought i was just going to have to put up with fly away hair the rest of my life this product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it it 's serious taming for seriously stubborn coarse or frizzy hair mine falls into the first two categories do n't use too much ! i use it after i 've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair even combing it gently in to reach every strand for the first time in years my razor cut layered hair is smooth	15
1	i really like this product because i have a natural do products that are too heavy do n't work this is perfect for my hair it makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good	15
1	i have had this for many years lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years it is very unique and the scent has a 'rich quality' to it the scent seems to change as the day goes on i really like it	15
1	my skin was winter dry and i expected this product to have richer moisturizing qualities the scent is nice but quite strong not a 5 star product as i usually get at body shop but works fine for more balanced skin	15
1	a clean and refreshing scent not heavy at all its top notes are citrus based and this is appropriate for day or night wear it is one of my favorites it reminds me a little of happy for women which i love but do n't wear because of its distinctly feminine smell cudos to clinique happy is a terrific man 's cologne it smells clean but not like laundry soap \( which too many men 's colognes smell like these days \)	15
1	this is absolutely the best concealer ever i have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup this stuff has n't been a problem ! it stays put all day long and does not shine	15
0	i 've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles and yes it does burn ! the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere i 've had dark under eye circles all my life i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money i will not be wasting my money on this product again	15
1	one of the best perfumes i have tried in a long time my boyfriend goes crazy over it	15
0	i have to agree with another reviewer this product is not worth the price tag it claims to have a vanilla scent and it does but it is barely noticible do n't buy this product based on how it smells as a moisturizer you can do much better for 23 00	15
1	i really like this product i would not however agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent i would actually like it to be stronger and have less peel and more juice smell but it is a nice scent and cleans very thoroughly not the best i 've used but very nice	15
0	i had trouble rinsing this stuff out it weighed my hair down and my hair is dry also my son came up to me and said why does your hair smell so funny \? i think it 's too conditioning for my hair and too smelly	15
1	i bought this along with the some kind of gorgeous foundation faker i do n't have the best skin \( oily \) but like a more natural look these two product together are so great i look natural but healthier and my skin stays less shiny all day i use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	15
1	this pur minerals starter kit is a great introduction to this brand i am absolutely in love with the 4 in 1 pressed mineral makeup \( included in the kit \) it 's so much better than the bare escentuals makeup which i had been using for years the 4 in 1 provides great coverage as it is a foundation concealer and spf 15 pressed powder all in one with bare escentuals i was having to buy the mineral veil foundation and concealer all separately and i still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well pur minerals is a wonderful makeup very lightweight and even the brush is soft on my skin ! i highly recommend it	15
1	i was amazed by the quality of this product when i first purchased it in the summer of 2006 it gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that i have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that i have not seen in years ! tui hair oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two or even longer if you wish	15
0	until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave ins it made my dry curly hair soft shiny and smelling great ! but lately something has changed the once thick silky liquid has turned thin and watery with a distinctly alcohol like smell it 's so disappointing this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book do n't bother with it anymore unless the original formula comes back	15
1	this scent is truly intoxicating i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore this product line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume how nice is that ! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good	15
0	the shipping was very slow and the product really is n't worth 23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer	15
1	it is a little pricey but so worth it to me ! i had a ruddy and uneven skin tone on my face and this has worked wonders for me i love this product ! it really does what it says !	15
1	i love lemon curd so i was quite happy to discover philosophy 's frozen lemon custard lip shine the consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well this is by far my favorite lip shine scent	15
0	i still got the marks iwish it had of helped i used it for a while after giving birth but it did n't help	15
1	i am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in manhattan the yves st laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in what a difference it made a worthwhile investment i use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch up concealer and brightener covers freckles and sun spots too	15
1	this product is perfect for dreadlocks i buy it whenever i am in the us i live in the caribbean and even in the extreme heat this stuff is the best for my hair type	15
1	i like this lotion it is moisturizing retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf	15
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
0	i bought this make up at neiman marcus excited to try it and i was horribly disappointed it was hard to apply \( i accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air \) and what i did manage to get on my face it did not cover much for the price they wanted this is unexcusable i promptly returned my airflash and got my money back i do not recommend this product	15
0	i usually love the philosophy brand bath and shower gels but this was a major disappointment did n't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating there are other gels that are great but avoid this one ! phew ! !	15
0	is this shampoo or sap \? \? what exactly is it supposed to do \? \? i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it not only did my hair feel like straw as mentioned by other reviewers but it was so heavy i could n't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo i 'll save this one for halloween	15
1	after watching anastasia do eye brows on tv i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows after receiving this kit i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves i do however shape my daughters brows in conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person	15
1	due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity nursing babies and losing a lot of weight the girls need a little help \( actually they need a lot of help but we wo n't go there ! \) i have worn bra inserts from the fabric store the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad they do the job but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day i love the silicone inserts iinserted in your bra they look like the real deal and since they cling to your skin they stay in place all day i call them my ex plants ! love 'em !	15
1	this body butter is yummy it smells good it feels good on it is a must for dry skin	15
0	my fiance' left this bottle of prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it it was empty ! ! ! seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer \( pump sprayer \) and then it all leaked out and down the bottle glueing itself to the jewelry box now we have an empty bottle of prada and a ruined finish on the top of the jewelry box i have sent sephora an email explaining what had happened but have not heard back from them beware of where you keep this bottle ! ! !	15
0	i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it	15
1	these are great if you have oily or combination skin just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine it wo n't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere anytime these are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by mac cosmetics except these are cheaper and work just as great i 've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so i guess it would be great for a metrosexual lol ! ! ! you 'll love these as much as i do	15
1	i used the same mascara for years i came across bourjois pump up the volume on an internet site so i thought i 'd give it a go it really does pump up those lashes and it stays put for most of the day too i use this mascara all the time now i think its great	15
0	i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out unfortunately i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess unfortunately the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that 's about it	15
0	i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like lemon pledge it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room	15
1	i have loved this product for so many years but have n't found it for more than ten i flew to spain and the evian was an absolute necessity ! it 's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet it is very refreshing and also brightens fading makeup	15
1	i love this shampoo my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he does \) anyway it smells amazing and really works well with my unruly hair	15
1	what a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow paula dorf says where are the brights \? not here and calls the shadows softly muted that is true but do n't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow it 's also named glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it the selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone i bought the gold which is subtle but is still gold i love the way it goes on and it 's suitable for day or night paula dorf will never have you looking like a clown but i do n't find these shades boring either	15
1	i recently bought all 3 of hard candys key to my heart lipgloss there are 2 different shades of lipgloss a sheer shade and a darker thicker shade my favorite one out of the 3 is pop it is a sheer light purple with shimmer and a darker purple gloss they smell and taste like candy it dangles on my keys and it is so cute ! it might be handy to bring a pocket lipbrush with you so it doesnt get on your fingers	15
0	not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw even my own sylist said whatever you are using stop you hair feels very damaged it goes back to normal texture if i use my other shampoos i made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the jonathan shampoo and it was it went into the trash do n't purchase this stuff unless you 're going for the scarecrow look	15
1	this is truly the best in highlighting products and i have tried many high end and cheaper products out there this is so light and just does n't get all cakey and greasy i have tried so many brands that claim to look natural but they just do n't this really does and do n't let the price fool you either it only takes alittle and lasts a long time so well worth the price for the look it gives i love this !	15
1	so glad to find this hard to find item ! i have tried every kind of polish dryer but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath for years i have used dry and shine with the great success it goes on like lotion drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine and dry nails i love it ! ! ! it is magic ! ! ! !	15
0	did n't like this product all of the actual scrub \( salt \) is at the top and minimal felt like i would 've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub it did smell nice and i like the packaging	15
1	i 've always used lancome mascaras before hypnose i used denfincils hypnose is a great mascara never clumps the non waterproof version is easily removable and your lashes look amazing definately give this product a try	15
1	i bought this item as a gift but i have used philosophy products in the past they are wonderful and have an amazing fragrance ! ! and they produce amazing lather	15
1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	15
1	i thought this stuff smelled fantastic and very similar to a lavender poundcake i guess smell is very subjective though so if you 're not sure about this one you might want to have a sniff at your local sephora or department store before purchasing	15
0	i have to write in caps because i am so irritated i have tried 5 different carol's hair products and none including this one has worked not only that the smells aren't all that great and they scream it's like people who wear bad perfume that's extremely strong but smells horrible they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	15
1	i first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester i fell in love with the sweet sugary light smell of it and so did my husband it 's perfect for all seasons since it 's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you 're wearing i 've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet now i want to try some of their other fragrances if they are half as good as this they win in my book	15
0	not what i expected ! this shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair it has no conditioning whatsoever i used the jungle conditioner after the shampoo it is equally hopeless ! it is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of india ! a waste of money a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype	15
1	i use the whole vitament e series \( cleanser toner spf 15 day cream lip balm and the nourishing night cream \) after a year in the desert my skin still looks great i just turned 40 and was carded for buying alcohol last month ! these are gentle products and work extremely well	15
0	this hairspray was too wet and too stiff it ruined my clean freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker yuck ! ! ! ! i love the voluminizing shampoo conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam but when i lightly sprayed the finishing hair spray it ruined everything i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump sorry jonathan	15
1	all of the bbare escentuals are great ! they make you look so young and fresh i am 61 and people say i look 40 ! even my daugther like it ! she is very hard to please great buy and last a long long time thanks ! ! ! !	15
1	neostrata is simply the best line of products i was introduced by my dermatologist 10 years ago they keep getting better i am 48 and most think i am 36 ! ! ! use all the products ! great	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
1	i have used this product for the past 16 years it is wonderful ! the super double face powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product the product comes with an application sponge goes on dry gives superb coverage ! i do n't even use my clinique concelar when i wear this product it is that good ! this product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin	15
1	this is a really great scent but it could of been better i think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals i mean seriously animals want to smell nice too	15
0	i have thick wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy i do n't think it is worth the money when i have found other poducts \( such as redken \) that work better and cost less	15
0	jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end the only mystery is in the details no real suspense i found the plot to be a little farfetched	16
0	i would give this 5 stars after sitting through about 20 minutes i gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining	16
0	sit down under a tree give it a big hug fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs !	16
0	solar flow is a fine dvd but should not be marketed as something separate from yoga shakti there are no new sequences just remixes of the shakti sequences since you can rearrange all the shakti sequences on your own solar flow is superfluous i do n't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice a little disclosure please ! rebecc	16
0	there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story \( in both regards \) have to do with the story as a whole \? nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin	16
1	i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that 's exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would 've moved along at a better pace but still a great movie	16
0	once again koch for reasons that i cannot possibly fathom assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog were n't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes i know i'm feeling large amounts of gratitude it 's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone right \? at least the copy i bought was used so koch did n't make a dime off of me anyway this is another koch release that you should definitely avoid	16
1	got this on ebay for 18 last year a great deal i am only bothering to rate this as it seems ridiculous that is rated below two other rather shoddy grant collections because of the holiday backlash objectively rating the content instead of the marketing would work for me	16
0	i was very disappointed with this second edition my daughter and i loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting the movie dragged out for the first half and just got worse during the second half i continually kept looking at the clock wondering when it would be over we only watched it once and it will go in the rummage sale later this year	16
0	i watched the first half hour of this and could n't get through it i dislike michael moore as much as anybody but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school it 's an amateurish whining documentary made more for spite \( and those 15 minutes we all want \) than anything else getting called down by michael moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside \( people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night \) does n't prove that michael moore followers are all waffling malcontents dude overall i rate this film fail	16
0	this is arnolds fakiest film i mean a demigod \? i ca n't believe this at all fakiest film yes arnold is in peak condition in this film but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow come on arnold no one talks back to zeus	16
1	flashdance with jennifer beals is such a 80 's icon movie and not only that but it has a amazing soundtrack to follow alex played by jennifer is a trying to start a career as a dancer but has no experience from any dance school so she wants to impress a bunch of dance people to let her in their school the movie has great scencic views and has great songs from a amazing soundtrack jennifer lopez 's song i'm glad has a flashdance theme so if you ever get the chance check out that video if you love your 80 movies then rent this one tonight ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
1	hard to believe it took me until now \( february 2007 \) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award deserving back in the early 80 's i loved this movie it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting especially tony montana a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is \( over 2 hours \) everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime it wo n't disappoint the ending gave me goosebumps it was that good and intense watch it now	16
0	absolute junk one of the worst films i have seen you will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration	16
1	based on a true story and a book called evidence of love this tv movie is made remarkable by the emmy winning performance of barbara hershey she is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex lover 's wife in a self defensive rage hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage brian dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament the movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for ms hershey 's dynamic presence	16
0	i loved these guys as a kid this collection sucks ! ! ! do n't buy it ! the first 3 dvd 's are silent and the 5th dvd is a reunion show the grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4 take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually if i could get my money back i would run to the nearest post office and return this item asap ! !	16
1	this is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish action packed and very smart great cast too	16
0	i was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie i could n't get past the first 15 minutes incoherent beginning and overly stylized particularly where ashe becomes the avenger \( for lack of a better name \) nothing like the original at all which i love by comparison	16
1	this special addiction dvd of reefer madness from twentieth century fox home entertainment is truly awesome ! ! ! includes both original black and white and colorized versions of the now cult classic ! ! ! plus some great extras too including 2 commentaries and the hilarious gandpa 's marijuana handbook ! two thumbs up ! ! ! five stars ! !	16

1	aside from the all star cast this story takes turns you 'd never have guessed it 's a feel good movie in every sense of the word	16
0	i must be missing something i bought this movie when i watched it i fell asleep its boring as hell trust me im a true horror fan and a gore fiend this movie was nothing the only gore was when this guy cut some lady in the heart and it looked so fake the only scary part was the end with this witch is everyone high but me \? this movie sucked ! boring as hell 2 stars	16
1	i'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	16
1	gwendoline is free spirited and lots of beauiful skin adventure and action good choice of entertainment they need to bring back a lot of these typemovies with lots of skin and g rated action nudity mades these films very special if you liked sheena or beast master this is a good choice	16
0	this movie has a good plot great acting and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos the profanity the undermining of parental authority and the lack of closure concerning landon 's journey to faith it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less than mature audience i saw more bad in it than good which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie	16
0	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	16
1	i really like this dvd you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises and she moves quickly from one exercise to another i like the variety of exercises there are not too many rep 's on any one exercise which keeps the workout from being monotonous this is the first programmable exercise dvd i 've used and i like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start \( and once i start i'm fine \)	16
0	i was a bit disappointed in this tape the workouts are too easy i had masteredabs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel 2 i could n't find it so i bought this one but its too easy i found a used abs of steel 2 and i like it much better	16
0	the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)	16
1	i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun filled nostalgia to purchase the entire series of the adventures of superman \( played by george reeves \) the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd 's \( i got mine all at once in a 3 pack collection saving a little \) this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series from the first episode to the last \( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves \)	16

1	the muppets take manhattan will keep your children imused from the very begining the music in cordination with the muppets of all different kinds keep the minds of young children going at all times i would recomend this movie would be great for children starting at age 2 5 and older	16
1	i read over some of the other people 's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it my kids ages 6 2 loved this movie from start to finish the music the characters and the story were great for the entire family i definitely recommend this movie for your family 's movie collection	16
1	there are n't enough movies like this these days family oriented \( centered actually \) adventure with edutainmental attributes great cast great score great \( albeit goofy \) story people give this film too much credit for being implausible which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true if you 're looking for adventure and fun thrilling characters in a family film this is it	16
1	these films used to be on tv all the time i was amazed at how clever the plots were i did n't remember some of them weird woman is my favorite b film and i'm always recommending it to people movies used to be so entertaining ! it 's great to have this collection available to film fans we can overlook chaney 's stiffness as the rest of the cast really compensates for it	16
0	over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself	16
0	she is a little poser ! ! ! kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies wearing that stupid little diaper always so happy she wo n't be so happy when i kick her between the legs also those stupid little cowboy boots she really sucks i 'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry that shown her ! ! ! the movie was good but she stinks	16
1	if your a pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier filmsthis deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellenthighly recomende	16
1	funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block \( region 1 \) is n't really present i took the shot to order this and unlock my dvd player if i had to \( i live in amsterdam region 2 \) but i did n't have to ! ! this dvd is region free ! thanks amazon but in future it would be nice to provide correct region information i bet that a lot european \( and perhaps australian russian and so on \) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region regard	16
0	when i first got this disc the other day it would not play at all i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive and it played however it does not play well at all the video is constantly dragging or skipping the audio is fine though i ca n't really provide a review of the content since so far it is unwatchable this is the only disc that has given me issues	16
0	this is one of the worst films ever made ! and i mean it ! ! one of the worst scripts i have ever come across the acting is hammy and the direction is very weak ! there was no reason for this movie to exist ! quot turbulence quot was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels ! no way ! if you like the 1st mabye try quot turbulence 2 fear of flying quot but stay away of the 3rd this is one terrible movie ! believe me !	16
0	this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood i'm not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition 's music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	16
0	p s has potential both grace and linney are great in it but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring it 's a shame because it could 've been a great movie great acting with a bland plot	16
1	i wish the ones with lex barker would become available i think lex was the best looking tarzan although johnny was still good a good watch although i say again lex is better	16
1	i ca n't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd take advantage of the low price and buy this now ! i'm no expert on the hot rod scene but this was very enjoyable the footage of pinstripe artist skratch is worth the price alone i would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this you get to see the creative process of some great project cars as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members i will definitely be watching this one a few times	16
1	this movie was one of the most honest accurate portrayals of how to play the dating game i have ever seen i liked it so much i bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers ignore the tacked on hollywood ending	16
0	my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u v lamp vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun vampires are supposed to be scary but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable the first underworld movie would be a good model	16
0	this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours characters were n't given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that do n't make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	16
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	16
0	i love speilberg films i really do but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap i just do not like it its not my thing i ca n't belive that richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense if you want to watch it then go ahead we all have different tastes however if you want to see a real speilberg film watch ones like duel jaws et schindler 's list jurassic park the lost world jurassic park and the indiana jones trilogy	16
1	i bought this dvd because i was getting sick of the other dvd 's that claim to be pilates workouts this pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial i am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks karen also keeps you motivated to continue not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one beware that you need a resist a ring for one of the workouts though and those can be difficult to find great great workout and i would recommend it to anyone	16
1	this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it 's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one	16
0	i was so excited when i read the reviews for this intermediate level pilates tape thought i would purchase it for variety from my 'the method' pilates tape i was very disappointed the tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat i did n't feel like i got a good tone workout i actually wanted to fall asleep i felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student i give two stars because i do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but i shall be passing this on to an elderly relative	16
0	just look how many are for sale thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is it has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting i fastforwarded about 70 of the movie ! and what got me was on the back it says family friendly im still laughing about that ! what has this world come to \? i would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone ! even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person does n't buy or rent this movie im embarassed that i rented it ! please turn away now	16
1	a terrific documentary even if you have seen it on pbs you need the dvd to view the great extra material	16
1	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade \( hitler 's killing machine \) sad but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas maybe only the jewish people would truly understand i found it all of these things but with love warmth to the end	16
1	clarification after reviewing the set and then receiving the set i must applaud a amp e for the brilliant 20 minute behind the scenes special on the 5th disc ! finally the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet 's heads ! also on disc 5 they did include the lost footage from the 40th episode ! bravo	16
1	this was a great history movie and in excelent condition at arrival thank yo	16
0	i turned the movie off was that supposed to be funny \? yes some kids' toy \( that happens to be a small motorized electric model of a truck \) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village i mean was this taken from the original stephen king book then shame on you mr king that 's overdoing the terror already so overdone not that the consept of trucks did n't appeal to me but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so called horrormaster so far believe it or not	16
1	i liked very much these series you will enjoy every momets in this moives it is deserve a place in my collection	16

0	what a horrendous experiment in comedy if you like jerry lewis i guess you 'll love this travesty of a film if you are a film snob you will love it personally as neither i am grossly disappointed and just really did n't get quot the joke quot it was trite and dull there was no point the plot technology encroaching on humanity well good try but again not for me if i am looking for a laugh i will watch a good coen brothers film	16
1	i saw this movie twice the second time knowing exactly why i wanted to see it again if you are trying to find out if you love someone or not make sure that you see this movie such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives explains why we are where we are and makes you part of the harmony is love as simple as teaching someone to bike \? think about it if there are no rules against it this film should be renominated for oscar	16
0	i saw tarzan the ape man on hbo or cinemax when i was a teenager and it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was stupid and had no plot	16
1	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever	16
1	this is great holloween movie to watch to get you in the spirit ! i watch it numerous times every year right before holloween with my little sister its a great movie ! ! ! ! ! ! !	16
1	as a kid living in iran this movie was my favorite though it is an old one	16
1	vhs i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever make up your own mind and do n't let others put you off ! i have all jane austen 's bbc series but this is my favourite angie london englan	16
1	i ordered this movie for my husband he loves it ! it 's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over no big plot but it 's got it 's moments i'm quite sure there is something for every european to be offended by so keep a sense of humor and enjoy	16
1	good movie that you do n't have to think about while it makes you laugh	16
0	this was not the entire version of the hbo special i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it	16
1	this is a fantastic movie ! the acting is superb and it keeps you guessing until the end nicole kidman deserved her oscar	16
1	you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut but it 's actually the opposite i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people this movie is the real thing i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too	16
0	i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star	16
0	this animated perversion of star wars is an insult to one of the best sci fi epics of all times the characters are utterly rediculus \( seriously if the jedi were that actually powerful why did they need the clones \? \) there is no plotline to speak of and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting if you want a good build up to episode iii i suggest playing star wars republic commando and reading labyrinth of evil and the other clone wars novels do n't wast your money on this it 's not worth it	16
1	this movie is an action mystery space love story with a lot of interesting charecters and you really get into it there is little swearing and half a second of nudity which does n't show anything but somebodies backside i would recomend this movie the ending is a surprise and there is cool plot twists	16
1	i 've seen it about 20 times now it does n't get old the faces the moves and the lines of matthew perry are always fresh my husband likes selma a lot so it 's a win win for both of us they are great together good stuff	16
0	i liked this workout the first time i bought it as her fatburning workout the second time i bought it re packaged i thought it was a fluke this time i bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training so it must be different nope i have 5 kathy smith videos all three with different titles and covers only three different contents i feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company one month later and i have yet to receive a response	16
0	not a good copy of this great movie i 'd wait and buy the quot restored authorized edition quot even though i bought this version i 've ordered the other that 's how much i like metropolis is general	16
1	yeah it 's true this movie is awesome i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it	16
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction \( he makes the best of a limited repertoire \) it just gets boring	16
1	i was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by cat stevens \( his name then \) i was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection i was and still am a fan of his music nice to see a dvd concert of his it is old music but if you 're a fan of the man you 'll enjoy it	16
0	the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going	16
1	the aids situation is far greater than we are told the corruption in africa is horrific the situation is beyond any horror film's scare anytime this film of lecarre's novel bears great importance to our future our destiny one of the most important films ever made ! actors like ralph fiennes rachel weitz need more commendation for it and director fernando merelles is a genius agripping thriller for the serious moviegover bravo 50 stars	16
1	if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and does n't do bad at all at the acting thing	16
1	this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old	16
0	i got this for my fifth grade class it 's better than the social studies textbook but not fun i 'll probably have to make worksheets to go with it basically a kid reads a history report as a voice over while the peanuts kids occasionally do something	16
1	very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery	16
0	i did not like this dvd at all it requires too many props such as bricks belts towels blankets chairs etc each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations as a beginner i find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention i feel it was a waste of money and do n't recommend it	16
1	the book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game the information is well presented and the cd is a nice addition but really i think counting the the tempo timing to yourself would be more effective at least that worked better for me	16
1	this film is one of my all time favorites i think it 's because these kids remind me of my friends and i as kids riding our bikes going on little adventures etc the cast is absolutely perfect wil wheaton was the best crying kid of all time with the exception of ricky schroeder in the champ lol river phoenix was excellent in this film which is an adaptation of a stephen king short story part road film part coming of age tale all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings	16
1	the quality was good and the stories were also good i am on the list when the first season comes out this is like a tease	16
0	i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what 's up with that	16
1	in 2 weeks i will actually be at the vatican for my first visit this wonderful dvd showed me places and things that i will never be able to see as a tourist but just knowing about the workings of the vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit this is a beautifully done 90 min dvd as only national geographic could have done i was thrilled with every minute i spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when i get home to remember my trip	16
1	this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	16
0	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after \? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i would n't	16
1	my kids really did learn a lot from this movie i would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty	16
0	this is not a good movie ! bad acting story and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it	16
0	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i was n't shocked disturbed or upset just bored	16
0	the movie has a great story unlike streetfighter alpha the movie alpha generations actually follows the correct storyline it had the potential to be a great movie but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately the character design sucks \( why dose n't ryu look like ryu \? \) the english voice acting sucks \( i recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles \) and the fights suck the only fight worth watching during the whole movie is ryu vs sakura this film dose n't even deserve a 1 star rating i just gave it that because there 's no way to go lower	16
1	i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film 's power as a period piece but it totally did n't it was seamless i will buy this for my home collection i have always loved kirsten dundst 's work and this is no exception	16
0	aside from the insanely beautiful lead actress this is pretty run of the mill stuff not scary only sort of gross but i think it 'd be best in print clive barker deserved better than this	16
0	when you look at the cover you think it 's about a fantastic trip into a black hole and what they find inside but it is n't it 's about a nemo wannabe wanting to enter the black hole i especially did not like the ending overall i would rate it story 3 starsactors 4 starsmusic 4 starsending 0 starsoverall 2 starsi am not insulting disney i think it came out just how they wanted it to and as with most disney movies the only pg part is violence i liked the actors and the robots but other than that it is a waste of money	16
0	this film is boring so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop this is a soap opera about politics oil companies it 's weird jump around style is confusing pointless do yourself a favor and do n't bother w this garbage	16
1	eric stoltz give 's a kick ass performance here ! ! how 80 's is this movie \? \? very which is why it rule 's ! ! gotta love elias kotes as a skinhead punk ! ! he look 's a bit like henry rollins back in the day ! ! i like the storyline a lot as well thing is though i dont know why he decided to go for his more friend of a girl as oppossed to tomlin 's charachter maybe because he knew her better ! this a real good view into the 80 's ! ! see it today ! ! !	16
1	i got my movie sooner than expected it was in a new like condition very nice and thanks	16
0	cool band worst videos ever ever makes me like them less fearless freaks is good this is garbage	16
1	a great ending to a great series it left me craving more not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful plus mugen and jin 's final \( for the time being \) battle was great leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle it was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie	16
1	i ca n't wait to see the original film again i remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea thus was born the inspiration for the great pc game lemmings yes i know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide nevertheless i love this movie i hope that they do n't cut the lemming sequence disney has promised a full restoration other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an arctic blizzard the hardships of an arctic existence were beautifully photographed	16
0	i enjoyed the first saw and kinda like the second but this has got to stop no more of the cruel heartless first it was people who didn't appreciate life now it any old hasbeen or no name d talented actor i am willing to watch another saw movie only if paris hilton nicole richie and lindsay lohan are attach large boulder and drop in some in super deep quick sand	16
0	this movie is soooooo boring ! ! ! ! the only thing good about this movie is the superfly soundtrack laced by none other than curtis mayfield ! ! ! avoid this movie it sucks	16
0	i heard that the nfl was releasing the past superbowls on dvd i was excited to say the least then i found out these are only highlight films a real dissappointment to say the least the films are available in their entirety why not release them \? i was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls as were several of the people that i was at a super bowl party with this year too bad the nfl fell short again	16
1	great improvements over the original dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2 35 1 widescreen ratio the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of approximately 2 35 1 which was not true i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price this plays very well on my hdtv monitor i 'll give the old version to someone w an old 4x3 tv	16
0	i'm a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word does n't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf the stories and characters are superficial boring and unintelligent people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get whacked a lot	16
1	i used to watch dinosaurs as a kid but now that i'm older i get the more adult jokes that are in the series and the underlying political and social statements being made in each episode it brings back old memories of my childhood i love it !	16
0	how can people like this piece of trash \? what a stinker ! i think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons and all that endless talk about quot the institute quot which looked like it was setup in someone 's garage i can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational it motivated me to turn off the t v and go for a ride i really believe this movie was produced by satan	16
0	i like almost all of lifetime 's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best the name bring obsessed was not what it should have been called the lady was dreaming and had an illness this movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through this movie was not what i had expected as i said i like almost all of lifetime original movies but i definitely wa n't be watching this one again	16

1	style salsa exerciselevel very fitthis is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market it is a salsa style exercise dvd it contains pure ny shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps it is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market this dvd is made more for the serious salsa dancer who is already fit for people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start i must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd it is very fast paced buy lisa 's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd	16

0	if there is one thing michael bay is good at it 's explosions big 'ol explosions there are a lot of them in this film along with a painful to watch romantic scene involving animal crackers this is a film that ben affleck billy bob thornton \( both in the film \) admit to being ashamed of pure leave your brain at the door entertainment	16
0	my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh ! ! ! ! ! ! so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever ! ! ! the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it 's not as though they could n't find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve	16
1	i'm not usually a ballet person i have n't seen anything since the nutcracker when i was six but this was absolutely brilliant the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop \? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet	16
0	the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on you ca n't do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way	16
0	incredible i saw one review describing this production the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible it is slow convoluted and uninspired no chemistry exists between the actresses with no connection to the audience	16
0	i got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it i bought season two and was pretty dissappointed the show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one i loved the ideas for episodes but did n't care much for how they played out bill got soft cuddles and dan got mean buttons and rocko stayed about the same but it was n't enough great show but stick with season one	16
1	i enjoyed watching queen latifah in a more mature acting but the picture quality of the dvd that i bought was terrible \( thanx to amazon \) to my surprise all the trailers quality were superb but the movie was terrible terrible and terrible to be honest the quality of the picture spoilt the fun side of the movie but still i say big ups to queen \( uyisikhokho ntombazana \) i had to use this platform although its of irrelevancy to comment about the movie format enjoy everyday like its your last	16
0	i am a fan of dbz i am a fan of goten i think hercule is funny and i think 18 is hot yet this movie sucked ! it was missing what makes dbz so great lots of action and a great plot broly is overused and this completely ruins him like most dbz movies it does n't fit into the timeline if we worked it in then goten and trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the fusion technique had this movie taken place after then the fight would be a lot more interesting in short if you want to see every dbz movie then rent it if you insist on collecting the whole series wait until movie collection 4 comes out	16
0	i resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years i make it 200 the other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler i just loved the u s air force personnel with scottish and english accents they must have overrun the 500 budget at that point	16
0	it has been a couple years since i 've seen this and i can still honestly say that it 's like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking a kind of swirly colorful mess with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick and ca n't escape it 's yuck of a screenplay on a positive note jim carrey is n't in it other then that nothing can redeem henry selick kaja blackley and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity and i mean that from the bottm of my heart	16
1	beware ! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer \( not the reviewer 's fault \) this is instead the movie version of return to treasure island and the tv version is by a different distributor	16
1	i do n't understand why there are so many low reviews here this movie was one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen also it was very unique i think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life this movie is fiction all the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what 's real about this movie and just sit back and laugh this movie was extremely funny ! !	16
1	the movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money they are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town wilhelm and jacob grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest this is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale	16
0	ok i'm a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened \? did they run out of money \? did the writer write himself into a corner \? there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you	16
1	notice to parents there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones adult nature a woman grows to 50 ft placing an extra strain on a strained marriage daryl hanna and daniel baldwin this is a light monster film not gory it is good for that it carries some laughs punny stuff and summer flick character no deep story folks	16
0	happy gilmore is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen then i watched billy madison and it was about a totally moronic spoilt rich kid total opposites sometimes do n't atract	16
1	excellent presentation and goes into detail much of which may be unknown to the viewer one minor criticism the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily	16
0	i think i just do n't like pilates because i really did n't care for this workout plus you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you 'll have a round hard belly this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes so that 's the main reason i just did n't like this video	16
0	i could n't watch this till the end bad production values gimmicky desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the nnui if you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken both intelectually and viscerally try something like miike 's ichi the killer makes this movie look so so needless the leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute 2 stars for the eye candy	16
0	what a horrific movie to gear towards children it is extremely violent and just plain creepy ! the scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so wrong i wish i could put 0 stars for this one do not waste your money on this one	16
0	i saw this at a friends house so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot not even lukewarm for that matter the acting is terrible please anyone who had anything to do with this do n't continue in the film industry if it was possible to assign negative stars i would do so for this awful experience run away	16
0	this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin	16
1	this is a typical \( semi slapstick \) gaiday film it is corny well produced and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy the subtitles are just fine you do not have to understand any russian to laugh at this movie buy it and enjoy	16
0	i watched parts of all the let 's dance salsa dvds and what a joke is this guy serious \? he needs to get a few dvds himself to find out about salsa rhythm lead and following and just general concepts of dancing i agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews what qualifies him as an instructor \? i think he 's doing an injustice to salsa if anyone is considering learning from these dvds do n't you 'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing but you 'll be a joke on the dance floor the only worth these dvds have to anyone interested in salsa is for a good laugh seriously amazon should consider removing this product	16
1	with king creole love me tender and stay away joe jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look especially how the choreography should be executed in this film we see elvis presley at his very best he was a stunning actor much more prefer him to james dean it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best it isn`t a classic it isn`t even great but we have elvis the king and that`s the best there is \) \)	16
1	a movie not geared for morons ! what a rare find there are n't many movies that ca n't be figured out half way through this film is great very clever never saw the ending coming	16
1	this is one of the best animes i 've ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew cowboy bebop has now drawn wolf 's rain i love the music played in the series that 's why they made a cd came along with also a stuff amimal wolf i wish their was a second season cause i began to love the show	16
0	this one is just plain awful ! ! it 's a bunch of hollywood brats being histrionic	16
1	this movie was very hard to find found it in dvd an it was new	16
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
0	this movie is a rehash of the first but it is a crappy unconvincing emotionally uninspiring movie let me guess what part 3 will be about a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time does not alter that timeline the way he wants \( i e always worst case scenario \) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else	16
0	about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood do n't watch this	16
0	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to quot act quot in this film after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch do anything you can to get out of sitting through this	16
1	maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre revolution russia the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy sentimental or even tragic	16
1	i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book but it 's not as bad as i remembered some episodes are actually incredibly funny the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie and have her come between joey and ross also the whole story line with rachel 's infatuation for joey could 've been better executed or should n't have been there at all it got bad towards the end but i'm not disappointed the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends	16
1	the series just keeps on getting better the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television the other funny show was newhart which i cannot understand why it has not been released on dvd the whole cast just clicks i wish shows like this were still on television if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !	16
1	quot above suspicion quot offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals the dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man 's \( bakula 's \) past comes back to haunt him consequently tearing his life and his family apart his wife \( sciorra \) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses quot above suspicion quot has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller as well as a heart warmer it 's a must see for almost any movie fan just do n't confuse this quot above suspicion quot with the film starring christopher reve	16
0	the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i 've seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it 's almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film 's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote \? just okay nothing to write home about	16
1	my girlfriend made me buy this video after a night of dancing at the local club all i can say is that the way marlon builds steps made it easy for someone who has no coordination like me looking forward to getting part ii next	16
1	i showed this movie to my students they had red the book and this was reenforcement fore the lesson they really enjoyed it	16
1	this dvd version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable hayley mills is her usual irrepressible self and the supporting cast is top notch the feline actor in particular ! \) i do n't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format it did n't bother me at all disappointment i could understand but this kind of vitriol \? it 's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages and i found it a refreshing change from the dumbed down kid 's movies they tend to make these days adults will enjoy the suspenseful story retro style and feline antics just as much as kids will i 'd skip the remake and get the original	16
0	no reviews for this video as the disk i have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of no disk is displayed as the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a dvd is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the dvd as i have to ship in from india so i can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk	16
1	this dvd is great heck it has the nickel on the cover ! anyways this dvd has a bonus feature of mac 's amazing three point flurry vs san antonio earlier this season in its entirety they used the tnt broadcast a must have just for that alone ! it also has franchise 's game winner during opening night fisher 's 0 4 shot wade 's heroics and of course the classic endings like rik smit 's buzzer beater vs the magic in 1995 larry bird 's game winners and ca n't forget about the best one of them all mj 's final shot in 1998 another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from horry carter iverson and marbury	16
1	ok this definately looks very promising i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago it was good if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector 's edition box set of the older series should be better i am going to purchase this soon once i purchase it i will let you know how good it really is i 'll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series goddess anjanee	16
0	four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction loaded with drugs with paul mccartney in charge what do you get \? magical mystery tour with no plot great music this plays as a too long music video without purpose ok if you 're a beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967 but if you were n't a beatles fan then there is no reason for this at least a hard days' night with richard lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers but this \? too many drugs and too much ego and no direction that 's all	16

0	guess i'm in the minority about this but this play \( not a movie \) left me thinking that i wasted my money i enjoyed madea she is a great character i never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems for me the only thing funny about it was when madea took the stage the rest of it was simply boring	16

0	i take this title form the video store thinking in wynton marsalis when i was watching the dvd i can appreciate that the image is very good \( not great and i have a 720p tube tv \) and the sound is very good also \( not great i have a reference equipment \) but the show is so boring look you just desire this man stop to blow the drum 's solo is just awesome but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	16
1	the dead zone is still one of the best shows on tv and while i agree with some of the other posts the stillson story arc was handled well strangely as for the dvd 's the box reads closed captioned as a feature sadly they are not hopefully usa knows about this and will remedy the situation	16

0	if shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play othello he would remove heaven and earth crying out for justice be an actor in a play of shakespeare it 's difficult and only the best ones can do it not mediocre actors with face of children what 's martin sheen doing here \? he should be in better movies and in this trash if you want a good othello adaptation get the movie with kenneth brannag and laurence fishburne are good actors and a better movie	16
0	horror movies are a dime a dozen now and nothing really speical about them anymore sad to say considering its probably my faviorte genere this movie was a disappointment from the start whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired i mean they are standing there talking and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen i didnt watch the whole movie it sucked that bad i bought this movie used and i 'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge	16

1	the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period there 's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done doris and perry como 's duet together was ok \( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him \) doris day has always been under rated as a singer her voice is sheer perfection it 's too bad that doris did n't do more specials or have a variety comedy musical show like carol burnett	16
1	i have always like stephen lynch his video live at the elray was absolutely awesome i even gave one to my cousin this christmas defintely worth the price	16
0	this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen it takes colossal gall \( to say nothing of immense bad taste \) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella tack on every possible bodice ripper cliche in movies then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original the acting is strictly mid 20th century nyah ha ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn i got this just to see the great luise rainer now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	16
0	after seeing match point which i loved i figured i had to see scoop all i can say is oh my gawd ! scoop is perhaps the worst movie i 've ever seen woody allen really should stay out of his own movies and the rest of it the story acting editing etc were just painful to watch i ca n't believe he went from match point to this dribble	16

1	well season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line \( or the theme as many will call it \) of southpark itself since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off my interest in southpark was revisited with season 6 \( also available on dvd \) however if you like south park or love it this is for you of course without saying however if you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together but this season was good	16

1	i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	16
0	i cannot believe this is billed as a baby video the images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value i personally like the baby miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby	16

1	this has to be the best of the alien films ! this film although not as scary as the original \( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien \) it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on buy the collector 's edition of the first and this and enjoy	16
1	this was a very interesting movie a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key i think i liked the skeleton key better but this was still a really good movie there are a few scenes with nudity in it not a movie for the youngsters we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	16
1	i have n't seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block busters i had to rent it my favorite part is when tom essexplayed by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw thehead and the head said get that damn screwdriver out of my head i could n't stop laughing it was so funny i never really liked many horror comedy movies but this one is really good the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook he was not onlyfunny but he was very brave and sexy to boot if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing he makes me want to watch itover and over and over again	16
0	for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance the dancers are all talented if self consciously hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough \( if you 've ever watched a competition \) and does n't need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess	16

1	have n't we all been there \? wishing we could be better than someone else \? wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight \? this is exactly how the movie cheaters affected me i found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this the plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question what would i do in this situation \? jeff daniels and jena malone give such incredible performances in this movie i believe that they are very convincing if you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie cheaters is the true direction for you to head in	16

0	how could mr cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody \? the production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos but the script and dialogue are so banal the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another \( including leo who was so good in what 's eating gilbert grape \? in 1993 when i did n't yet know who he was i thought he was really a cute little retarded kid yet in titanic there 's just nothing there or nothing permitted \) talk about a ship wreck ! ! only the two studio backed block voting resulted in the record tying oscar wins nominations	16

0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	16
1	this dvd is one of the best i have seen only britney spears live tops this in picture quality ricki sings his best songs in front of new york city backdrop he put alot of energy into this concert the sound quality is the best and picture quality is also great a little bit less fuzz on some objects would have been nice ! but still its great and colorfull with all the lights on stage	16
0	dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless	16
1	this is an amazing dvd i read reviews online all the time saying anyone will like this but seriously i even showed it to my mother who laughed that 's a big deal this dvd follows these four comedians on their two week tour their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city also throughout the episodes it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in america during her time of need interpersonal relationships and anything else they could think of this dvd makes me laugh to tears every time literally	16
0	pablo francisco is like michael jordan on the wizards he just isnt as good as he used to be i hope he proves me wrong in future material save yourself some money and get his old work	16
1	in this cynical day and age it 's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant \( not to mention amazing \) but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage \? this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls' early years and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea it 's all things to all people but it 's never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it 's a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings	16

0	i'm not a big fan of bruce campell but i was appalled while viewing this film i know it 's a b horror film but there was no orginality in this movie i know it 's suppose to be funny but come on people was it really \? the only part that was slightly funny was when campell 's wife was going after the gypsy for the first time needless to say i think it 's interesting that this movie was a book going off subject however on a late night talk show bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a pg 13 horror film i 'll conform with that	16
1	brosnan is great kinnear is really funny a gem of a movie	16
1	i have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv i had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and i have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out the gradual awakening of young ta to which girl is truly right for him and sammy fong 's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts the ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from james shigeta to a professional dancer afterall it 's the music and the story that make this great	16
0	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave pilot dave and fireman dave i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks unfortunately there 's a new dave \( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues \) and it 's just not the same the new dave is not bad perse but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all	16
0	i collect 1950s era sci fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds unfortunately i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape the vhs version by uav entertainment \( the wade williams collection \) is much better hopefully uav will come out with a dvd version soon	16
0	the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame ! the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one 's arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one 's leg that 's it how incredibly dull ! what 's worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i would n't waste your time w this video	16
1	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes plus an extra un aired episode the show was not only far ahead of its time but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies this dvd is a must	16

0	after two decades since watching upstairs downstairs i rashly decided to buy the whole set ! ! ! ! as i watched the first episodes i realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me ! the melodrama was a bit vulgar and very predictable ! later episodes of the set improved but not by much ! it was like watching a biplane that did n't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway i hope you wo n't make the same mistake i did	16
1	well it was good i enjoyed it but it was not the best plot and the characters had 2 d personalitys the worst thing though was how abruptly it ended other than that it had that great japanese animation and it was pretty fun to watch	16
0	the crappiest dvd release ever ! video and audio quality sucks ! this is not a jet li movie buyer 's beware ! i 'll give this a negative rating	16
0	very short game took about 2 hours to finish it \( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it because as always their system is unavailable please try again later took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy \) as to the game you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary gameplay was average for a shooter it seems episodes basically translates to really short game which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something	16
0	travolta was great in saturday night fever but this country version just did n't work although he 's a good actor he just was wrongly cast in this film	16
1	this film can be interpreted any number of ways as a farce a tragedy or just plain shakespearean comedy brenda blethyn has in the past acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill	16

0	i had read with delight the book called mrs frisby and the rats of nimh to my grandsons so i thought the movie would be a nice followup wrong ! it barely resembles the book and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out it might be ok for a child who has n't read the book but we were disappointed	16
1	this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much	16
1	a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity as a big fan of greer garson i must comment on jane bedinger 's review in which she claimed that ms garson was having an affair with the actor who played her son ms garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made i do n't see how ms bedinger could consider this an affair	16
0	i have to say that even though teti hatcher 's performance was good the movie itself was terrible the plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable i can t believe i wasted my money on this one	16
1	the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	16
0	this dvd skips quite a bit making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie also the plastic covering on the dvd casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off i 've never had a movie do that before i would think twice in the future before buying movies from amazon com	16
0	even though tsui hark is one of my favorite hong kong directors this movie did not at all show his skill the story was poor along with the actors performances i may be a little biased since i love john woo and tsui hark killed their friendship by making this movie worth checking out but i would'nt buy it if i were you	16

1	dave is a lot of fun as a look alike gets to pretend to be president gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power and makes high stakes enemies i am a big fan of sigourney weaver and she is very good here kevin kline does well as well the forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love definitely worth a rental if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag	16

0	i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck ! \) and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better	16
1	a great exercise tape plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick if only denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily this would really work	16
0	the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that 's pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could 've been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i ca n't really think who might like it	16
0	spare me another movie about how the big bad catholic church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated mary poppins the film 's agenda is all over it and binoche 's character is just too practically perfect in every way	16

0	i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off the mark african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it was n't his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all	16

0	this is an excellent film which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor i was very disapointed in the quality of the release the picture quality is poor inter titles appear to be missing and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on screen it 's a shame because a film like this one deserves much better	16
1	it is not much live color is to dark and 2 songs are missing 16 17 \( kalimba de luna \) go bey boney m gold 20 super hits it is the best	16
1	this is a fantastic version of taming of the shrew for anyone who is interested in really studying the text \( and hearing it spoken correctly \) this is the version for you ! the actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying \( yipee ! \) they also have an uncanny way of speaking the speech which gets it across to the audience as clear as day you dont need to understand 'shakespearean verse' to see this performance the actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast which i belive they are !	16

1	these lovely little gems are perfect for those women who like me have a second or third ear piercing small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious these would make a great gift for a little girl as well i particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as i suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection at the price of under 10 dollars i was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there how are you	17
1	the watch was in perfect condition and arrived much earlier than anticipated we were very pleased with this purchase plus i could n't have asked for a better price	17
1	these earrings are of very nice quality and were what i expected i am pleased with these	17

0	product is not as pictured looks like a dimestore fake i had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids and now have to spend more money to buy her something else i would not give this to a 4 year old let alone a 34 year old i am very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
1	very well satisfied it 's great for a kid to learn to tell time and the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable	17
1	i like the stop watch functions that this watch has i also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions unfortunately this watch is hard to read in bright light such as sunlight and well lit spaces overall though i like this watch because it looks good well it looks good on me anyway	17

1	this watch looks incredible the case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium it really can go with anything you could wear it with khakis jeans a suit pretty much anything because the color is so versatile if you 're looking for a quality watch that looks good and for a really good price well look no further	17
1	these earrings are really pretty there are not real great variations in the color between each set \( they are all pastel after all ! \) but each has a beautiful sheen and color they are also set very firmly on the backs i was worried that for the price they would n't hold up but they are very nicely made the packaging was okay but not deluxe what i appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls which i found informative all in all a good purchase and well worth the money	17
1	obviously the pearls are flawed but because of their size you ca n't tell even from a short distance away they 're super cute but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own	17
1	the photo of the necklace looked pretty but i did n't realize it would be so nice ! my daughter loved it and i will probably purchase one for myself	17
1	the facets make the chain quite sparkly i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains	17

1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
0	this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases	17

1	this watch met all my requirements and it well suited for my hand i liked the feature of turning the digital display on off the strap is also smooth doest hurt ur skin the only negative remark i found with this watch is the indiglo night light is not that bright as i expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch	17
1	the earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me i was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire these earrings were much more flexible that the 25 year old pair i was replacing i doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well however they do what i need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation	17
0	please read mr marcus c dunn 's review because i agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings in my case i bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee when i first received it today i was really liked the design of the earring but after closer examination i noticed that the blue stone was very light blue good quality earring for a young teenager \( 9 to 14 years old \) but not for the woman i'm going to spend the rest of my life with returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson jewelry has to been seen and bought with your own eyes and not through fancy photoshop website with touchup enhanced photos	17

0	i bought this watch for my husband but did n't take the time to read the description carefully so it 's my fault i had to send it back he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift unfortunately it does not work if you 're more than 2 000 miles from colorado if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch	17
1	what a great buy ! beautiful and high quality watch for a great price it is probably an older version of the seiko coutura watch but it really does not matter	17

1	i came across this looking for angel pendants i bought this one and the matching earrings i absolutely love this pendant ! wear it all the time and always get compliments on it you can wear it year round ! one of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time i wore it ! would n't recommend those ! but this winged pendants is beautiful	17

0	i was hoping for a little bit higher quality but you get what you pay for i gues	17
0	wife liked them so much she asked me to buy her a set of black ones she was also happy that they had 14k gold posts she loved the quality	17
1	nice ring fast delivery i still need to check it out because my daughter says it does n't completely break down the way my old puzzle ring did	17
1	i love knowing the exact time \( even if my mom thinks i am crazy \) and it works like a clock ! i never have issues with the updates \( in illinois \) but i do have a few minor issues the watch is too thick \( 5 8 inch \) the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human the buttons are hard to press and the manual is too small and hard to read still if i had a choice between this watch or my borhter 's rolex i will take his rolex and exchange it for 40 casios thank you casio	17
1	i ordered one each for my 5 year old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine 's day nice pearl color and oval like shapes slightly too big for a 5 year old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult very dainty a great buy for the price	17
1	paid 45 for these and worth every penny they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself	17
0	i purchased two of these necklaces but the first one broke the second time i wore it good thing i purchased two	17
1	i read the reviews for these earrings and i am very pleased with the results i purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too	17
1	this is a really fun and fashionable watch it has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug i like the pink dial that changes color depending on the angle and lighting the dial looks pink yellow or purple i also like how fossil made the band adjustable remove or add as many links as necessary there is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter	17
1	my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first it is nice for dressy or casual highly recommended	17
1	i sent this watch to my five year old grandson as his birthday gift he was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting besides he started playing soccer at that time	17
1	this is my second casio watch of this type the watch is maintenance free adjusts itself every night and takes care of daylight savings time	17
1	i have three holes in each ear and i really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes these are wonderful ! they are small but exactly what i wanted such a great buy for this price	17
1	this ring is just about what i expected it 's fun and puzzling and it looks nice i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it \( i 've always been good with puzzles so it might take someone else longer \)	17
1	prompt delivery good quality well worth the price actually just the right size for all occasions many complements on them thank you kathi abbot	17
1	this watch is definitely something that i will keep with me for a while it is simple elegant and came to me for relatively cheap the free shipping is always a bonus and i also came across it in the gold box deals and when i saw it i knew i had to have it it is pink and is lighter pink in the center the bracelet was large with the extra links so i removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller i think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings	17
0	i was shocked when i received these earrings they are quite small more for a child than an adult all in all they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real ! the price is right	17
1	i bought this as a holiday gift they 're a nice size clear stones with good purple color i'm very pleased with my purchase particularly considering the price if i were to change one thing i 'd have preferred larger backs and a sturdier post	17
1	well this is the watch band that i originally had on my seiko watch i searched the internet to find a replacement amazon had it for a good price i ordered it and got it in the mail three days later	17
0	this item was a nice gift the stones were a little discolored but that 's what you get for only paying 100 for 1 4 carat earings online	17
1	i love this ring ! it 's interesting to look at and i like the design i have n't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle maybe one day i might try it but i like it so much i do n't want to chance it now shipped fast	17
0	these were on my mom 's wishlist so i bought them they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed i 'd return them if it would n't cost me and i was n't so lazy they look pretty darn cheap for starters also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo velour bag with a price tag for 3 30 on it save your money it 's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen	17
1	excellent quality the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do the ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples pits or other defects i am very happy with this purchase	17
1	i 've purchased this watch from mid watch company as you can see it 's a fab casual watch and is worth the price the service was great and on time and i am very pleased with this purchase thank you	17
0	this set of earrings was only 10 and the delivery from silver insanity was fast but false advertising really pisses me off they do not look nearly as nice as the picture and in fact the glass part of the earring is plastic and it even has bubbles in it it 's ugly the other earrings that i bought from them also do not look much like their photos	17
1	i first came across the silver insanity line of celtic jewelry last year when i was looking for christmas presents jackpot ! i confess i spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items both on amazon and on the silver insanity website the teardrop earrings i picked out were quite a success so much so that i recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver celtic knot earrings for myself i 've been very happy with my selection and i just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend i highly recommend the items from silver insanity and plan to order from them again	17
1	this is a very good looking watch it goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well dressed	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
1	great watch bigger numbers and easier to see has all the features	17
1	they 're cool some break to easily but others dont it does not feel like you are wearing a watch and they are very small its just like i said they break easily but i would give it 4	17
1	i bought thes earrings \( and pendant \) for myself they are absolutely beautiful they have so much shine and sparkle to them everyone keeps asking me where i got them i'm reluctant to tell but i do	17
1	my fiance is a horse finatic i bought pendant as a present for her when i received it i was impressed with the detail it is lovely and shines as only silver does and i know i 'll get big time brownie points when she opens it on x mas also a great stocking stuffer	17
0	most of the items were fine they were just given as gifts with 4 damaged i have tried to return without success i am disappointed that i am not able to return damaged or not functioning items i may think twice about ever doing this agai	17
1	bought this to use at work since i had to send in the one i usually wear for repairs lumi is extremely bright when charged the monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive seiko swapped the band with a nato fits a little bit better on my wrist overall a good purchase	17
1	the watch is very lightwieght and is scratch resistant so far ! i wear it at work everyday and its holding up great ! enjoy the watch and always buy from amazon	17
0	i work in nyc and live on long island and the watch would never connect the whole point of th watch was that it did that but it never did i returned right away	17
1	i purchased this watch winder as part of my husband 's christmas gifts this year to pair with his new tag heuer carrera i compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores \( ie neiman marcus \) carry sans branding it 's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over winding you can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one	17
1	i bought these earrings as a birthday present they are very pretty i am pleased with the quality and the price	17
1	this is a gorgeous and delicate looking watch i can read it without my glasses and so far it works i 've had trouble with timex in the past so i hope this holds up well it is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening	17
0	the watch came in a great looking case the face of the watch was attractive then oops could n't fasten it because there was no fastener it came with a return address slip for sending it back which is nice but i 'd rather get what i thought i ordered	17
1	i had purchased similar earrings elsewhere but had a problem because they were n't hypoallergenic when i saw these i got them immediately have had no problems since	17
1	this is the second item i have ordered from this company and i am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money i would recommend them to anyone	17
0	i guess you get what you pay for but i thought it would be a bit nicer than it was very cheap looking not well mad	17
1	this is a beautiful watch storage box great value my husband is a watch collector plenty of room for the large invicta and croton watches nice design and color a must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection	17
1	i 've found that i receive quite a few compliments whenever i wear this necklace great color combo not too heavy the price is right	17
0	having read the other reviews i expected something small but decent the particular pair i received had two defects 1 one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2 one of the stones had a very large visible black inclusion near the top it was visible to my naked eye \( i do n't have a jeweler 's loupe \) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts maybe i just got a bad pair but given those two problems and the small size of the stones i sent them back and did not try again	17
0	this watch was a disappointment it has a huge dial but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny it 's also an extremely flashy watch the image on the web site makes it look classy not so additionally the watch is completely useless under low light conditions it neither fluoresces nor does it have a light up function returned it after a week got my money back	17
1	these are beautiful earrings they are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking my only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and i feel as though i need to handle them very carefully they are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them	17
0	great watch manual very bad all depends on how much time you have to invest it will take it because of sorry manual	17
1	the first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed to amazons credit they sent me a new one right away this watch is fine i needed a rubber band because i am in water a great deal of the time at workand i live near the ocean i am always in the water with my children so far the watch is great and has held up to expectations no problems except when the first one was shipped broken i would buy it again	17
1	these earrings are perfect to wear every day they are comfortable to sleep in no need to take them off in the evening they are small and classy will look great with any outfitthey are exactly what i was looking for and i'm really happy with them to help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone 's ear i 've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear see it in customer images	17
0	seiko has produced a loser of a watch i really liked the design and seiko reputation of building a tough watch i have purchased seiko divers in the past with no problems i didn t know these watches were made in singapore maybe this is why my monster doesn t work who knows toke to authurized dealer for repair he wanted 175 dont buy seiko	17
1	item came to me fast it is very confortable and very reliable i do n't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves i highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people	17
1	this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion \( hard to read in direct light \) also who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph \( instead of a 1 10s dial \) \? but overall for this price a good deal and good looking	17
1	i really love this watch it looks so nice and elegant shipping is supper fast only 2 days ! great deal many thanks	17
1	the shape of this pendant is very flattering \( elongated draws the eye downward \) it looks great with the windows hoops i purchased at the same time the chain is nice and as with all zina sterling the silver is very polished and beautiful	17
1	this watch was purchased as a gift and i was pleasantly surprised when i received it the quality is excellent i had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky but i found it to be in line with watches of the same type this watch works well with casual and work attire and i was tempted to keep the watch for myself in fact i regret not purchasing one for me to keep buy with confidence	17
1	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts overall very pleased and a great value	17
1	wonderful watch easy transaction given as a birthday present recipient loved that it came in a can	17
1	these small earrings are great ! i can sleep in them and because they are platinum i do not have any allergic reaction to the metal ! i'm so glad i found them	17
1	lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert key type clasp it 's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular use type of necklace i think it 's best suited for the nimble fingered traditional fashion person	17
1	i love the workmanship in this piece nicely done and silver insanity has awesome customer service	17
1	great set of earrings at a very nice price thanks	17
1	i'm a pretty big guy so it does n't look out of place but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy it runs well keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability if you 're an extra large person and do n't mind a heavy watch you may be interested in this if you 're average size or smaller i would n't recommend it personally this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet proof in normal use	17
0	i ordered this bracelet as a christmas gift for my best friend based on the reviews it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price however upon receipt of the bracelet i was so disappointed in its quality that i felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet	17
1	happy with the purchase the watch was what i expected casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town	17
1	as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it 's a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller	17
1	great value and excellent quality better than anything that i 've seen locally highly recommend	17
1	i have skin allergies and was not able to find a watch that i could have on my skin until i found this watch the price of the watch could not be beat for the chance that i could not have it on thank you for suppling a great watch	17
1	i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it	17
1	this watch is attractive fairly heavy and well made \( esp for the price \) one small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up 4 1 2 stars	17
1	my husband just loves this watch and ca n't get over the great quality for the price	17
1	classic style and leather too ! the perfect little black watch at the perfect price	17
1	this is my third skagen watch the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons at less than 80 00 each they are a real bargin	17
1	i love the look and function of this watch but guys if you have any hair on your wrists be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band i 've had 3 other fossil watches and never had this problem i think fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one ouch !	17
1	these are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work diamonds are a nice clear quality	17
0	this product is not worth the price by itself it 's fair at buy 1 get 4 free the time function works fine the compass on the other hand is virtually useless having gotten 5 watches all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	17
1	a quality earring good size and very bright the are also very secure	17
0	i was very disappointed in this purchase and eventually ended up returning it the actual product did not live up to my expectation while the cross was of average quality \( not great but ok \) the chain was very cheaply made it did not even have a clasp on it you had to pull it over your head to get it on the price of this item did not match the quality of the product by any means even though i was disappointed with the item i have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back no questions asked	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it he has received many compliments it is high quality and arrived in perfect condition it is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well almost bought the watch at a dept store but saved 25 using amazon great product !	17
1	\( \) the watch has a nice weight beautiful face and is generously sized i need to have several links removed before i can wear it it comes nicely packaged although at first i did n't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included they were hidden inside the top of the watch box it was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time but once i got the pin out it was a snap to adjust the date and time all in all an excellent watch for a great price !	17
1	i bought two of these one each for dh ds and both have found it perfect apart from having to remove a few links \( if you 've got thick wrists it is perfect indeed	17
1	watch is the best on the market i've had it a month now and love it the compliments keep coming in and amazon's price was the lowest i could find anywhere both on the net and at the discount stores if you want to cath the ladies eyes this is the watch for you	17
0	i really liked the way this cross and chain looked unfortunately i only got to enjoy it for about a week before the flimsy chain broke and i lost the whole thing	17
1	this is my second skagen watch my first one which was almost identical to my new one lasted ten years of daily use i love the two tone combination of gold and stainless steel my only disappointment is that at a glance it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand i think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand otherwise i love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face	17
0	this necklace is like a strong circle of silver there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid	17
1	i bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it \( caden \) it looked great you could fit 5 or 6 letters on it it was a good locket	17
1	this is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture very pretty overall	17
1	i love this bracelet it 's very pretty looks just like it was shown looks expensive tasteful i have bigger wrists so i 'd like it better if it came in larger sizes but it goes great with my watch	17
1	i like the unique style of this necklace and received compliments on it when i wore it to work the price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads	17
1	this watch is beautiful the picture do n't make any justice the quality from amazon is flawless highly recommended	17
1	this product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery i am sure it will satisfy me when i want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on but also since i have n scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful i e pliers hammer etc	17
1	i got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much my only complaint is that my wrists are super small and i had to get links removed but that was no big deal i only wear it when i need to dress up so it 's still in good shape	17
0	i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch however it never worked i do n't know if it had a dead battery or if it 's broken the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch i will try to resolve the issue with amazon	17
0	i bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price that is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch but i guess you get what you pay for	17
1	the watch is just as discribed it is heavy and large the person i bought it for had to get several links removed it would be great for a larger man	17
1	it is a good watch under 200 price range if you buy it you will love it forever one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal \)	17
1	i presented it to my sister 's daughter and she loved it very much she loved cell phone watch and even box i felt very happy and i would suggest any one to buy this item	17
1	this is a must have watch for serious runners i have had mine for over a month and i love mine i am a professional track and field athlete and i train very hard to win races this watch helps me train better than any other watch i 've ever had it gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track not only that but it has 5 interval timers which you can set your appropriate rest time on if you are a serious runner like myself i highly suggest you get this watch it is definately something that you will need	17
1	i just received this today somehow i completely missed that the pendant is on a silver wrapped wire and not a chain had i noticed that i probably would not have ordered this piece and i would have missed out it is very nice it has a nice weight to it not too heavy but substantial the wire lays on my neckline just right and the pendant looks beautiful i'm very pleased with it	17
0	the color of the actually received ear rings was quite light a darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive since that showed a much darker colored amethyst i wo n't buy jewelry from amazon again when it comes to a colored stone hsn depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	17
1	the watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo one of the few times when i can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared	17
1	the pendant is striking shiny and great to look at the diameter of the pendant is the size that i expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it great purchase would buy it again	17
0	when i first got this watch i was thrilled it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing at the time i thought he was just po 'd because i didnt buy the watch at the store as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart what a piece of junk ! i regret buying this watch and i advise against it	17
0	it turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife 's ears i assume that the stems must not be white gold \? other than that they are as expected not perfect but not bad for the price	17
1	i bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18 chain for a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter and she loves them both i loved the price ! the earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace she says she only wears them to church and special occasions a great gift for teenage girls	17
1	bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b day she loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them	17
1	extremely reliable easy to read looks like the rolex style only it is very lightweight good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch i would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery	17
1	i purchased this watch for my 7 year old son it is a eye catching and because it 's lego it was an instant hit it has numbers on the face \( not roman numerals or lines \) which is important when they are beginning to tell time the price is fair the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic it gets a bit sweaty all in all it 's a fun cool ! watch	17
0	i recently bought this casio automic solar powered watch and was very excited by the automatic time keeping feture it is agreat watch but does not have a timer built in which i need when working out fartlek runs and in between sets it has a uselesss feture of recording time of events which i am not sure why anyone would actually need this with out the data of what actually happpened during those 30 recorded events \? wish casio would put a timer in it guess i'll go back to a timex ironman later	17
0	i bought this watch as a christmas gift for my boyfriend after 2 weeks the round thing on top of the watch came off the seller says it has to be sent to repair and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back i am so embarassed of the poor quality gift i chose and ca n't belive they will not replace it with an apology their answer is just not acceptable but there is nothing else i can do but write this review i have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews i read i was happy with the gift but now i am so disapointe	17
1	this thing is a rock ! ! its heavy indeed i like that it definetelly feels when i have it on its been taking hits since last year with no scratches what soever everyone that see it loves it the picture dont do any good you have to see it and feel it in your han	17
1	i loved the wiccan protection knot pendant i purchased it for my daughter for christmas and she has n't taked it off since she had wanted a celtic tricetta necklace but absolutely adored this one just as much thank you	17
0	the link remover is too flimsy to work i ca n't even say it works poorly one of the two tweezers is missing the case is nice	17
1	this watch was a very good buy for 45 looks like a nice 85 90 fossil watch the dial looks very elegant with those numbers overall i am very happy with this buy	17
0	these watches sounded like a good deal given the original price i ordered two one for myself and one for my brother they arrived today and both could not be set that is the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out they were both stuck in the case so tight i broke a nail in the attempt and i agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless they go back tomorrow	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
0	band deteriorates rapidly \( 4 months \) design makes it exceptonally dificult to replace withouttedious modification see other reviewactual picture of band shows how replacemnt band fails to follow curve of watch body real dud monthly cost of ownership makes it as costly as a role	17
1	the watch was delivered on time it came with the little box everything was in great like new condition	17
1	nice quality it is a shame that they do not have the same in longer cords as well	17
1	product matches expectations no problems some other customers complained about how lightweight it is to me it seems like what you should expect from titanium \( after all that 's why they use it to make aircraft \) the predictions of it getting sprung \( losing its spring tension \) were more of a legitimate concern to me but i 've had it for a month or two and it seems fine it seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip which is to say maybe it eventually will or maybe it wo n't them 's the risks of life go for it	17
1	the earrings were a gift and were most warmly received ! they were a real hit !	17
1	zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why i am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant the pendant itself is beautiful and the silver shines but the garnet is very small it is a nice red color though i purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three	17
0	got the watch friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny the number lines glow nicely in the dark i willoberserve the watch and come back in a month to say my opinions	17
1	i am very impressed with the detail work on this ring it is really eye catching and quite lovely the shipment arrived very quickly the stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice but the clarity of the stone could be a little better however for the price it is an excellent ring and i would gladly give it as a gift	17
1	i bought this for my wife for valentines day and she was elated she said they were the perfect size and weight when she 's happy i'm happy	17
1	this is a tiny compact watch with elegant design it is fit for the women attending the formal parties plus it works great this price deserves its value	17
1	i received this watch from santa and boy did he do a good job i love it ! it is a very nice watch and it has handle the russle and tussle of a single mom 's life without much marks ca n't beat the price	17
1	i was pleased when i received my earrings however they 're smaller in reality than what 's pictured on the website but they 're still pretty	17
0	come on ! i thought they had erroneously mailed out czs ! these earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them ! what a rip ! the sterling silver was nice and well constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones quite a disappointment ! i had to buy an emergency back up christmas gift for my best friend	17
1	good watch for a firts one ! ! ! ! ! ! simple to handled and very easy to use thanks a lot ! !	17
1	the picture does not do this watch justice it is a very sturdy watch with a nice looking all silver body and band it does not look cheap at all !	17
0	the diamonds are waaayyy too small nothing like the picture sent it back	17
1	i had one exactly like this one for over 20 years but finally the crown fell off i am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine i expect the same quality of my new seiko i highly recommend this model easy to read dial \( especially the white face \) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry	17
0	i bought a nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago the strap is already falling apart near the bezel the watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal even if the problem is poor workmanship	17
1	a really beautiful watch with very very nice casing adjustable strap which fix easily on my 4 and 8 year old children they love it	17
1	works like advertised syncs well with atomic time from colorado \( i am in california \) looks nice	17
1	my last ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business lots of heat grease and water ! my new timex combo dual tech watch has all the same features especially the timers which i can set at different intervals you ca n't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch a plus it has both digital time and good old watch hands	17
1	i am really happy with this purchase ! the earrings came together in an attractive box \( perfect as a gift but i do n't want to give them away \) they are nice and large on my earlobe and look great they are really soft to the touch and i like the colors too	17
1	i purchased this item as a present for my friend and i the piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone i myself have the yin half of the duo the only problem is that the black paint in the yin half is easily washed away now i do n't mean that it all washes away but it does erode the yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint however but i do worry about all of the paint eventually going away other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull i 'll definately be buying from this seller again	17
1	it 's not the most expensive watch but it does n't have to be it 's a looker of a watch classy clean and sharp looking mesh band on the wrist \( any i have a skagen also \) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking terrific buy price	17
1	i had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after christmas after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same ! they just arrived and all i can say is wow ! nice look substantial size and plenty of statement picture does not do them justice all i can say is do n't hesitate you will be dissappointed if they sell out	17
1	bellisimos los zarcillos los uso muy a menudo y el tiempo en que hice la orden fue bien rapida su entrega su tama o real concuerda con las medidas que ofrecen	17
1	i 've had this watch for about nine months now i wear it every day it keeps great time and looks great as well many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it the mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear	17
1	for the price this watch ca n't be beat very thin very light and it gets quite a few comments i am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently skagen is notorious for fragile crystals at 75 however i wo n't be that upset if it has to be replaced overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair	17
0	bought this for our 20 year old son for x mas i was very disappointed with the quality of this 85 pendant and returned it the very next day the chain looked and felt like plastic my initial reaction when i took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine went to a christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for 28 that was 1 000 times better than this 85 one	17
1	perfect watch just as i expected lokks great both casual and semi formal	17
1	my boyfriend got me this watch for valentine 's day and it is gorgeous ! the face is very small as other reviewers have indicated so if the recipient likes smaller face watches \( as i do \) this is a great gift it looks more like a bracelet than a watch good for small wrists elegant looking classy i love it !	17
1	let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m	17
0	the image really looks much better than the actual product stones are quite brownish not red as one would expect of garnet i would n't recommend anyone purchase this	17
1	i got it since two month ago and it looks cool i like it	17
1	very slick easy to read watch with the contrast of silver hands on a dark blue face appreciate the smooth comfortable mesh watchband which easily adjusts to your wrist size	17
0	fair warning had i had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company 's watches i never would have bought one do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money the percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low	17
1	i'm logged in on my wife 's accont i never had problems with the band i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you 'll love it it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works	17
1	i 've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite i love the large face and the titanium bracelet \( you do n't have to remove the watch in order to shower ! \) a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too given the price and quality you ca n't go wrong if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen the work is completed in a couple of weeks ! in summary an elegant watch at a reasonable price	17
1	i bought this item for my grandaughter whose birthday is in august i think she will like it a lot i know i did	17
1	the set is absolutely gorgeous in person and i'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster the clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design and it 's incredibly secure when fastened however it 's difficult to maneuver and i ca n't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on or get it off without assistance that 's the only reason i would n't give this five stars the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great	17
1	i ordered it and it came very quickly \( earlier than expected \) i love this pearl necklace	17
0	these earrings have no blue in them ! the picture is extremely deceiving	17
1	just as my title states this item was purchased as a gift my friend loves the pendant but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
1	i have shopped with this company before and have never been disappointed fast shipping and delivery reasonably priced and always what you expected	17
1	this watch is gorgeus it 's a very big watch \( it does n't look so big on the picture \) the screen can be set to black or red looks good either way very confortable	17
1	i purchased one of the casio men 's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch vq200hda 9bvcf from amazon this watch is great it updates the time automatically \( just switched to daylight savings and i did n't have to touch a thing \) instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates again cool looking great watch ! ! ! !	17
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive yet reliable accurate stylish analog \( rather than digital \) timepiece this is the watch for you easy to set up comfortable to wear no backlight so hard to read in low light a good buy	17
1	great product for the price espeacially for a starter set fear not you cant go wrong here	17
1	these earrings are so cute ! they are a great size for a toddler but probably a little large for a small infant it is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute these are a beautiful rose pink color very sweet	17
1	i found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear they look much better than the ones found in macy 's fine jewelry and they cost less personally i would not go over 1 3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious i am very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	this is a very nice watch the pink mother of pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i did n't even care the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the 10 that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition otherwise the watch is highly recommended even nicer than in the photo	17
1	will be given away as a gift i am pleased i hope the receiver will be i like the chain which i believe can worn separately or with another item	17
0	there are n't any colors in this pendant just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant same happened with heart i ordered from this seller normal swarovski crystals do not have a topaz covering the beauty of the crystals sorry i wasted my money should have bought from swarovski site	17
1	i 've seen very inconsistant reviews for silver insanity items i received this necklace for christmas last year and it 's pretty nice generally i always receive a compliment when i wear it for the price it 's worth it if you 're looking for something nicer you 're simply going to have to pay more	17
1	i bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine the watchband is way too big for him fortunately i am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable therefore he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark as soon as he gets up in the morning though he takes it off	17
0	i am still waiting to receive my item so i couldn't possibly rate something i don't have except to say that its taken way too long to receive	17
1	i needed something to express how i felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me	17
1	i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it ca n't lose with this one	17
0	the clip holds the money but the credit card holder is a bit scary it just does n't work that well plus it is very heavy if you put 5 bills in there even without the credit cards this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket i would not recommend it	17
1	quality of leather looks nice i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off it 's metal squeazed to leather and that 's what i expected you just have to keep an eye on it and do n't sleep or shower in it it looks nice	17
1	great value looks and performes great ! ! ! ! ! ! has a lot of class and goes great with any type of apparel only down fall occurs when placing the alarm it 's kind off complex	17
1	this watch is very attractive and keeps great time it seems to be very high quality and i like all the engraving	17
1	this was a stocking stuffer for christmas my grandson loved it and it is performing well	17
1	i have owned both the black monster with bracelet \( my daily work watch \) and the orange with the rubber strap \( which i sold to an envious friend \) besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint	17
0	i received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch unfortunately the crown would n't pull out \( to set the date time \) so i returned it immediately fortunately amazon 's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping \( either way \) for broken items i 'll probably try again with another invicta from amazon	17
1	i always wanted a titanium braclet and i found this on of all places amazon com i thought why not \? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person ! very high quality the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy it does not look gawdy or bling bling tacky treat yourself and pick this one up	17
1	as other reviewers have stated this watch is large and it 's heavy i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms the night light is cool and effective	17
1	i had a previous expedition watch that lasted many years and served me well i purchased this new version and so far have n't been disappointed if you 're looking for a basic watch that tells time and has a backlight i do n't think you can go wrong for the money	17
1	great item do n't go looking for huge diamonds but it looked good over all and my girlfriend loved it so i guess that 's the most important thing	17
1	the earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find my daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one but that is no bash on the earrings the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment i would definitely buy them again	17
0	i bought these for my wife for christmas 2005 by august 2006 one of them fell apart the gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld which broke it was not due to any abnormally rough handling it would have cost 50 00 to have repaired now they 're throw aways	17

1	i read the reviews of the other buyers while i was purchasing ing this ring the first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect i promised myself i 'd write a true review of the ring once i recieved my own the stone is neither large nor gawdy the silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick the stone is not high nor fake looking the picture gives an acurate display of the product all in all it 's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked	17
1	my husband has become an avid watch collector so i gave him this box for christmas the design of the box is as attractive as its contents my husband says that it is easy to use too from the looks of things i will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection	17

0	the aquamarine earrings do not look at all like aquamarine which is supposed to be light blue they had no color so i ended up returning them	17
0	the stones in the earrings were not at all like pictured they look very chea	17
1	sometimes you realize you need a watch but do n't want to spend a fortune something that 'll last long is solid yet fashionable and easy to use this watch has it all many times girls have stopped me to see this watch it is sophisticated stylish and only 85 no matter where you go the metal stays shiny the glass virtually scratch proof days of the week military time day of month \( problem with this is it does not know if month is 30 days or 31 so u have to set it yourself sometimes but rarely and worth the effort \) i highly reccomend this watch to everyone	17
1	i will buy more items from you guys i got them quikl	17
0	this watch looks good but the movement is terrible i got this watch as a christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand i must warn you if you purchase this watch then do n't be suprised if it does n't work right it may look like a rolex but it does n't work like one	17

0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
0	this watch stinks crappy manual the band is so big it could fit around my leg and when i received it it didn't work now i have to pay extra to fix the band and to get it working so much for what i thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch i would 've given it no stars if i could don't make the same mistake i did avoid this watch	17
1	these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag a very nice gift	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	the item has arrived in perfect timing the earrings are good quality but not the best one	17
1	the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she 's used them for some time	17
0	the chain was much thicker than i expected and it 's pretty obvious that it is n't real silver but if you want some cheap metal bling this will do it	17
1	i have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices this winder is so quiet that i have no problem sleeping even with it on i highly recommend it	17
1	i bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for christmas the girls wear them all the time they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them	17
0	the pic online is not a true representation these are more like baby cuffs was so embarassed to give as a xmas gift	17
0	i did n't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before i purchased the watch this is disney and tinker bell ! the word flirt did n't bother me either because tinkerbell was a flirt wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band i was shocked that this watch is under the children 's section i needed this for my grand daughter 's birthday like it was said before i could have given this five stars but hot and saucy for a young girl oh no	17
1	this ring is beauriful and eye catching i unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded and despite that the ring remains beautiful	17
1	bought this as a gift for my brother he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he 's a tough person to buy something for	17
1	i read the reviews on this diamond just before christmas when it was on sale for 99 00 the diamonds are better then expected and i consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks no visible flaws i am sure if i used a loop i could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair their great for 99 00 diamonds	17

1	i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself it 's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40 below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire	17
1	i needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well	17

0	i 've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped so the crown no longer locks in place i 've tried contacting citizen for waranty and they say it 's not covered citizen claims that i over tightened it or cross threaded it while screwing down so it will cost 50 100 to repair total joke ! i 'll never purchase a citizen watch again i 've always thought they were cheap to begin with this just confirms my thoughts	17
1	these earrings are beautiful they are big so they look best if worn by themselves very light so they are very comfortable	17

1	i was surprised at the quality the bracelet and necklace matched perfectly it was a great gift for my 23 year old daughter she loved them	17
1	i wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this timex design i was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person clear face leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some good weight \( not too heavy \) i have received a few compliments at work co workers were surprised at the value for the cost overall a solid timex offering that you will enjoy if you 're drawn to the style image that appears here in the product details	17
1	i did n't expect the earrings to be so beautiful and they 're really easy to wea	17

1	i bought this for almost 50 less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase the only trouble i have had is with the clasp it is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly i found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open	17
0	this ring does not look as pictured it arrived today \( almost 3 weeks after i ordered it \) and is extremely thin has tarnish marks and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places it looks like it came out of a vending machine and i'm obviously pretty disappointed i wo n't be buying anything from this vendor again	17
1	this dainty heart looks absolutely beautiful on it picks up the colors of your clothing it is an amazing price for such a beautiful pendant	17
1	it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave ceptor and it adjusts time according to the place you are in so good watch !	17
1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival the author obviously knows his stuff what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published i'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j l bourne a deal he 's good	18

0	the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation why could the equation not be solved \? there is a reason for this fact and the mathematical theory explains it well but not this book perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book but apparently not in this one	18
0	i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training including the different levels snd sub levels i would have bought a manual i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing i got neither the characters were neither likeable nor substantive except for the cop next door i have no idea what they even look like or what if anything they care about besides dogs the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear maybe the series inmproves after this book i'm not taking that chance	18

0	i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other type of woman thanks	18
0	is the main goal of every male evo psy writer to attack feminism \? here 's an experiment for you juxtapose the ideas in this book and say pinker 's blank slate with those of i do n't know any two female evo psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages it 's f ing comical but guess what \? the females' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males' are a lot of wishful thinking hmmm aging successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging successful males are made for each other that men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s and to fawn over repressed chastity obsessed airheads whatever	18
0	it starts out like laura bush 's rules for driving but skydives after the opening pages in which the then 17 year old laura kills a young man with her car who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend ! my interest in the book sharply dove after that as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about laura bush	18
0	was given this book as a freebie someone must be buying up copies for an austinite this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth string techno celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when louis the xiv 's chamber pot was carried by except this is n't the sun king guys get a life or at least an authentic artist to swoon over all of garriott 's stuff was strictly derivative now that we have the real lord of the rings to watch who cares about cheap imitations	18
0	if excelsior college did n't require this for the cpne i would take it and throw it off the highest bridge i could find horribly confusing does n't make sense and i cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice the only redeeming feature is that excelsior does not let you write in this so i will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student i do n't mean to sound harsh but this book is n't easy to use it is confusing and contradicts itself	18
0	i bought this book and also last night based upon the gushing reviews you see above who are they kidding \? the main character is a cad it is far from a tour de force in erotic anything his short stories in last night are only marginally better your time is better spent with other authors	18
0	uninspired and unsatisying the writing style is austinesque but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not margaret 's motives and emotions are obscure and the author 's assertion that her quot heroine quot has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed quite the contrary	18
1	after purchasing many dog training manuals and finding them not quite up to snuff i was very pleased to finally find a book which was comprehensive and authoritative it breaks each area of the sport down and is easy to follow the book is intelligently written	18

1	while this book like its predecessor is beautifully illustrated and a joy to read it is the presentation of quiltmaking as a shared experience among family and friends that make both these books so special i loved the first so much i had to have this one the moment it appeared and it has only served to add to my list of pending projects	18
1	i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer is that logical at all \? \? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father \? if he had the senator when he was twenty he 'd have to be 77 is it really reasonable that he 's running around killing people and setting houses on fire it was a very unlikely twist to the end it still was a good book	18
0	as a lecturer of e commerce i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted	18
0	i tried reading it and made it about 3 4 pages i'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign i seem to recall mr sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy guess what mr sedaris \? i do n't give a \( expletive deleted \) about your so called bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough 's books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style	18

0	i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller goes to show you some people have really bad taste the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog it seems like the author was being paid by the word too much repetition entire scenes which added nothing to the story etc i would never purchase another book by this author glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can charli	18

1	i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run down community is a classic of american literature what this book and o'connor 's other novel the last hurrah apart is the writing in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man o'connor wrote very well and his language is beautiful from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all	18
0	i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one 's but this book wasnt in that catagory	18

0	i visit england frequently i have an earlier edition of this book which i find to be very useful even now the new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility i have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an english pint is 16 ounces anyone who is serious about english beer knows that an english pint is 20 ounces	18
0	talk about self absorbed i guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business i thought the man made some good points but few are helpful to anyone in the real world \( or outside the newspaper business \) nausea sets in after the second chapter neuharth will die an old lonely rich man respected by many hated by nearly all luckily i did n't have to sit through this entire book i put it down quickly	18

1	once again mr updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women love lust betrayal self doubt villages relates owen 's life as only john updike can the last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book but i will certainly recommend it to all my friends	18

1	this text was assigned reading in a psych101 back in 1970 but its themes have stayed with me so strongly i am now ordering it for my personal library i was born with a club foot and experienced the power of being different even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely noticed by others stigma gave me an appreciation of the force behind my own shame and the reaction to my difference of others more importantly i learned about the degrees of identity which differences make the most difference \( sex race disabilities \) and the increasing intensity that comes with breaking the most closely held norms a classic study	18

0	i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries	18
1	this book provides great insight on modern business development concepts and design techniques the framework provided will save hours of time spent building common libraries or frameworks the industry support via codeplex and the csla forum site speak volumes of the value it provides	18

0	will somebody please tell me what the appeal is \? yes i know it 's a classic but it 's a really really boring classic the prequel to charlotte bronte 's jane eyre is the story of bertha mason 's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why bertha went nuts it 's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they did n't like little french girls in jamaica racism sexism and classism drove bertha `round the bend there i 've saved you the trouble of reading it now re read jane eyre instead	18
0	i was a philosophy major in college and i hated this book but then again the whole nambla fic genre really does n't do it for me i'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart good for them i'm incredibly well read and thought this one was just a tepid bore save your time read some dostoevsky some dickens some milton \( \)	18

1	this is a straightforward description of reading and writing the arabic script if you have no experience with arabic i think you would still need to locate a teacher or native speaker as some of the letters are very difficult to pronounce as native english speakers however for the most part its easy to follow and would give you a great start especially before you take an arabic course if it came with a cassette with pronouciation i would have given it 5 stars	18

1	excellent book telling a shocking but real story of genocide on an unbelievable scale	18
0	many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm 's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate \? someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read	18

0	i ordered this for a friend thinking it was the same bruce fisher book i bought when i divorced it is only the workbook and really needs a workshop \( or maybe just a book \) to go with it it was a total waste of money and not what i expected when i ordered make sure you are ordering the book not the workbook when you order	18

1	i first picked up this book because i 've always been interested in what young writers have to say but i have to admit even i was a little surprised this story mind the mythicism is a real representation of what young children 's minds sometimes go through that idea of a person you fabricated gaining more reality than necessary congrats to ms oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about she is one i 'll keep in my mind for a while if you like young writers you should check out charles hedji 's fields of discovery i'm an avid reader once again	18

0	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far but secrets was a big disappointment to me as far as i am concerned ms steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins \( some explicit parts i didn`t like at all \) simply not the danielle steel we like the story itselfs is ok \( gives the readers some insights behind the scenes of hollywood \) but some of her books i`ve read over and over again i am not going to touch secrets for a second time however	18

1	like many of the other reviewers here have already stated this is a book to be read by everyone ! i am not a reader of westerns but i loved this book after 800 pages i was never so sad to see a book end lonesome dove has a little of everything drama action humor and a few love stories to boot there are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did by the time your are done you will have new friends woodrow pea eye claire lorena but especially gus mccrea and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening blue duck i ca n't recommend a book any more than this one	18
0	i try to read items that i would not necessarily agree with however this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations misquotes and spin she uses tacky research to make points that do n't exist then brushes off any critique as liberal bias if you are a conservative please read something that will allow us to discuss matters coulters' book should be titled slander liberal lies i made up	18

1	when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop i decided at once that i needed to own it it 's large it 's bulky but it 's beautiful it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom 's works as an artist myself who learnt a lot from tom 's unique techniques i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art both colour and black and white has been compiled into this collection but it 's not just pictures there 's an insight into the man himself a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists like myself waiting for recognition	18
0	book is totally disorganized beautiful pictures but no way of researching values the price list is in the back organized by lot no auction no no reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book no way to look it up starts out promising then becomes a total jumble totally impossible to locate anything too time consuming and then still no resolve	18
1	this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape grounded firmly in love and faithfulness it moves quickly i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that 's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu and it is not transient but deepens miriam abu 's sister remains with me in her moving quietude and the litle girl lela hand in hand with julie plucks deep	18
1	after reading being peace i ordered additional copies for all my close friends this book is both thought provoking and accessible thich nhat hanh has a way of presenting buddhist lessons and ways of being ways of living and thinking about ourselves and our relationships to others and the world in a style that is almost deceptively simple and deeply thoughtful i highly recommend this book as either an introduction to buddhist thought or as a way of enriching any life	18

0	i'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing i kept thinking maybe it 's me maybe there 's something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru they all seem too long unfocussed what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories the quality puzzles me because i'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines i have n't followed this anthology over the years but this particular edition imho shows bad selection and worse editing	18
1	i discovered this in an airport bookshop and it is a great read on a flight i takes some of the most insightful trend study and boils it down so that anybody can get their arms around why design is the most important factor in your business today yes any bussiness this is my hyperbole tom is much better at stating the case but when a management guru like tom puts out a visualy interesting as well as well thought out book like this it is time to take notice read and use or be left in the dust	18
0	i was very disapointed with this book it 's a large volume of just opinions the profile is somewhat useful about 20 pages of good stuff but the rest could be trashed	18
0	the information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids it is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem	18
0	i have not read the original version of this work but the translation lacks originality and art a beautiful story but the writing style lacks grace and creativity this is the only time i have liked a movie better than the book do yourself a favor and skip the book the movie is quite beautiful and moving	18
0	please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature read this book yourself before giving it to your child it discusses oral sex anal sex how to use and purchase condoms masturbation \( for girls and boys \) etc when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth as she would have stopped sucking her thumb the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate	18
0	i 'll be blunt i did n't care for this book i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her i really think the title was misleading as a sidenote lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis	18
0	ms howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one it 's ok to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one so disappointing especially after her wonderful hilarious to die for the trees \( for paper \) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time	18

0	good book on deal structure but if you want a valuation number check out quot unlocking the value of your business quot	18
1	i used this book as a student and still use it for teaching pieces are nice and students are challenged to think musically it moves quicker than some other method books it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate upon completion of the first grade book students can play standard repertoire in the early intermediate level students must have completed early elementary level before using this book because this book starts with playing two hands in c position emphasize phrasing from the first piece highly recommended	18
0	what a disjointed mess talk about cashing in on fame all he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book i could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper i was not that enamored with liar 's poker and this book has done it for me with this author it was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good	18
0	this book is poor it 's not quot philosophical quot in any sense because it 's not logical and it 's not supported by the majority of music scholars today reimer contradicts himself at every turn he does n't understand what langer is really saying and his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy feel good nonsense	18
0	flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking	18

0	i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author 's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author 's former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book	18

0	ed klein is really so desperate in his attack that he ca n't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against hillary ! what a lot of misinformation and outright lies to actually accuse marian wright edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal and to insinuate that chelsea was the result of a rape even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant is disgusting i should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were monica lewinsky !	18
1	this book was an amazing account of the spanish in north america many of the themes that occur during this time period occur in almost every time period and place dealing with religious intolerence slavery econmoy unification and the influence of all people on one another this book captures everything themes this book expresses about this time period are even more evident in today 's information age as more people from different backgrounds and heritages come together on the internet this was a good book to read and made it easy to see the flaws and benefits of the past showing what not to and what to repeat	18

0	a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton 's whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow minded attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in \? sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books	18
1	my two boys ages 3 and 2 both pull this book off the shelf over and over i use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary \( both in english and spanish \) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers \( also in both languages \) as well as colors it 's a great addition to the workbook flip flop spanish and also just for fun my littlest a one year old girl even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them they 're sturdy pages full of all kinds of things the kind of book you find something new each time you open it it has little lists to find items as well	18

0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18

0	i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book considering the title however the actual project does n't make an appearence until the last chapter the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place this book was disappoiting to an extreme	18

1	ever since starting on the simple abundance journey with sarah ban breathnach 's first book i have longed for an opportunity to learn one on one from the queen of simplicity and authenticity we may not be able to meet sarah face to face but now anyone can enjoy a workshop atmosphere in the comfort of her own home women caught up in the day to day deluge of deadlines appointments and commitments can now curl up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self i highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur	18
0	the characters are uninteresting and 2 dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else do n't waste your money	18
0	i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them	18
1	this was by far the best genero kenzie novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down i was happy to see angie and patrick back together the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book i'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane has n't published another it 's been 5 years i will be watching for it	18
1	simply clearly written the book is a very practical guide for someone new to but serious about farming concise yet still comprehensive and fun to read would have liked a section on draft animals but schwenke 's disclaimer for not including it makes sense	18
0	it 's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout truly basic and nothing new here spend your money elsewhere	18
1	a very difficult topic to cover but one which is broadly researched and well presented	18
0	i'm a big nora fan but i could n't even finish this one by the fourth chapter i began to skim way way way to much detail for me which made it boring and slow testing and corrosion is it fake is it real blah blah blah enough ! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother \( i forget his name \) but thats it folks unlike all the other reviewers i hated it i say pass on this one but as you can see i'm in the minority	18

0	i was the commander of my highschools afjrotc rocket club so my godfather bought em this book it is very informative but if you are just building basic este kits then this is way to advanced for you as it was for me and the other cadets in the club but if you are really into rockets this book is for yo	18
1	the previous review is clear about the value of this translation knowing a bit of german i can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for gestalten the real value of the work beyond the translation however especially for first time readers is found in the notes made by david luke these notes are helpful for the historical context allusions to goethe 's personal life and work and allusions to philosophy literature and more all essential to understanding the work	18
0	this is a tough read he gets so bogged down in the details that i forgot what i was reading about	18
1	for someone like myself that is new to selling and licensing art this book is so informative i am so glad that i bought it it is also a good reference book to keep on hand i recommend it	18
1	i would recommend the power of simplicity to everyone this book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy the idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life this book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy although the book is considered an educational read i feel that it is extremily entertaining as well it 's just an interesting book it doesnt get much simpler than that	18
1	mill states here that he still believes traditional gender roles \( as we now call them \) are desirable but being john mill he passionatly believes in the freedom of lifestyle choice for the individual hard to argue with that	18
0	rosalind krauss' theories have some merits and if you are looking at a book that will drive you up the wall the entire time shouting at it read this i would never allow my grad students to read this dribble	18
1	this book is loaded with the most recent medical findings and is organized as a referenced book although i read it cover to cover	18
0	filled with bizarre generalizations and the most pretentious phraseology i 've seen in years this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture history politics or even writing style it seems she should have spent more time with turabian 's manual for writers than surfing the web or watching sienfeld	18
0	this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up	18
1	i had ordered this for hanukkah 2006 but luckily i took a sneak peak first my daughter aged 4 would find this far too scary despite its inappropriateness for the younger more sensitive reader it is excellently written and very well illustrated i have not returned it but it 'll be a while before it comes down from my shelf	18
0	i picked up the audio book from the library and did n't know by the title and author 's name \( my first jance book \) that this was chick lit i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known it started real well and ms jance knows how to reel you in with her writing midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor and then about her friend who died of als and then came the long responses to the blogs it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama	18
1	i really did enjoy reading this book cover to cover it 's very touching and very informative it will change your ideas about a lot of things the writer along with other expert contributors have done a great job bringing out all of these real moving stories i would recommend this book for every human being who cares about other fellow human beings	18
0	i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction apparently oprah 's as well	18
0	if you have this book keep using it for the review only but not for the tests i suggest use 15 tests of meylani for the practice	18

0	i had to buy this book for a class it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it \( as does the rest of the class i am told \) it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp 's his personal opinions are a real turn off and unnecessary	18

0	this book \( i believe \) is one of lem 's earlier stories and it reads like so so pulp sci fi fiasco \( a true 5 star science fiction novel \) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist \( i 've read all of his stuff except 2 books \)	18
1	having spent time negotiating sports sponsorship contracts i have a new found love for negotiating in reading this book the authors have laid out a clear and concise program in which to begin work through and close negotiatings a great book for beginners and a good brush up for intermediates and pros	18

1	this is a very interesting book particularly on the early restrictionists it gave me a new perspective on why americans restricted immigration in the early 20th century and gave me historical insight into today 's immigration policy crisis	18
0	this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family 's experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction	18
0	i bought this book the paperback version the text is good it describes all his letters and tries to do a lot of explanations too however the prints of his paintings are not that impressive they are very dark prints go for some other book if you want to see the corect colors of his paintings	18
1	this book covers all the elements of game theory emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism the philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment the 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key concepts such as the minmax theorem the geometry of equilibria and linear programming the book has not changed much since its publication in 1957 but it is by no means archaic even for those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook quot games and decisions quot is highly recommended as a supplement there is something for everyone in it	18
1	this book is a very detailed starting point for renaisance fans at its heart this is a socio economic history the clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant chapter 5 the human unit was the most informative most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb this is the type of book we all wished we had in school	18
0	other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit picking and general vindictiveness of this book i agree with these criticisms but i'm not going to revisit them here the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari 's party line as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full unconditional scholarly access to miss rand 's papers any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice nor should they be	18
0	i looked for an introduction to the basics of office automation and bought this book every example code i tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial samples from the msdn was just as good as this book if you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there this book is ok but for any real programming it is not very useful	18
0	the author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center he is not an expert in auto mechanics as he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality if you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice you are better of visiting the automotive section of www howstuffworks com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free i bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and i regret it	18
1	this is one of the best biographies i have ever read you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work it 's a true labor of love filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes this one is a keeper who knew miss francis was such a wild child \? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase	18

0	i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	18

1	the essential histories series from osprey could easily be compared to the cliff notes series they 'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with but no real depth most volumns are under 100 pages therefore do n't expect many man in the trenches stories this volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war and presented a bit better than most in the series	18
0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !	18

0	this book gave me insight into german culture it is no wonderthere was a holocaust with children 's books like these max and moritz are adventurous children and they are caught being caught is n't enough they are ground in a flour mill for punishment not even that suits the miller he feeds their remains to the ducks it instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap this story will forever give nightmares	18

1	while i consider myself a regular theatre goer i 've always been aware of kramer 's plays and opinions yet i have n't seen nor read either of these two plays that changed this past weekend when i saw the revival of normal heart currently playing off broadway this is a viscerally emotional piece of theatre and it makes one feel impassioned about what was going on in the world then and sheds a new light as to what 's going on now in regards to the hiv aids crisis it 's a must red if you do n't have a chance to see it	18
0	you get a view into 60 's white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional quot white quot depiction of the world	18

1	it is almost like dream comes true when i saw the revised new second edition out at the bookstore the imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor but has graciously added new updated materials in synthesis you may see it as an equivalent to jerry march 's advanced organic chemistry but a whole different approach the sections on oxidations reductions and organoboranes are excellent since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like nicholaou 's classics in total synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry	18
1	this book depicts the essence of the african american struggle and not just from a woman 's prospective but from an universal one the women and the men in this book are victims evenly naylor is a literary star and her poetic prose is her spotlight which glows undyingly in this classic novel a must read	18

1	this is a highly informative and accurate book it presents the data in a clear and graphic form with a minimum of statistical manipulation the studies cited by the previous reviewer lloyd rowsey are based on econometric modeling since the one he mentions two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results one is by ted joyce the other by john lott and john whitney econometric modeling can prove anything if you want to understand crime in america in the 1990s buy the crime drop	18

0	american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	18

1	i enjoyed this book for the most part i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the quot mountain quot the main characters were all there participating in the problem solving there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode and some food for thought added in as well is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there \? i do n't know but this book presents some interesting questions i await the next book in the series	18
1	this book focuses on a cogent question by way of a true story and invites response from all sorts of people with pertinent experience providing biographies of these respondents the topic is forgiveness i found the analysis by dennis prager an l a talk show host the most understanding of christian jewish outlooks and jose hobday 's perhaps the best of the christian contributions i am eager to discuss it with members of my theology group	18

1	a great read for anyone interested in cards i managed to pretend to my friends that i knew nothing about cards before cleaning them out after reading this book	18
1	patriotic terrorist fighting storyline exposes the political games played in washington that many times put our military in dangerous situations this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave i know the book is fiction but i ca n't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction mitch rapp 's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man again hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it although 95 is absolutely wonderful and inspiring portraying men as real men	18

1	this book melded two things i never thought i 'd see in one book the salem witch trials and modern drug research sounds a little weird at first but robin cook makes it work alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century salem ma make this a very engaging read as with other books by robin cook none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to no matter how rich smart etc they may be great read ! very exciting endin	18
0	there 's nothing unique about this text all the topics discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on corporate finance mergers etc the discussions lack depth the whole concept of corporate strategy has been miscontrued by the authors the link between this and financial markets is very ambiguous blur ! fyi i'm a businessman hold an mba in finance from an international university	18
0	unfortunately this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days even though it may have been remotely funny \( sometimes the author comes close to being bearable \) the book never actually tries to be humour is supposed to be smart however this book gives us the worst case of dumb	18
1	that about says it all bill bryson is a hilarious writer i like reading grammar books anyway but i was always excited to read this book as it 's so entertaining besides that it can teach \( or remind \) you of a lot of good rules of writing the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary and some necessary entries are left out	18
1	this is by far my 2 year old son 's favorite book and he has lots of them whenever it 's time to read to him he says quot toot toot quot and i know that means he wants to have this book read to him sometimes several times in a row the illustrations are wonderful and there is all sorts of stuff going on if you look closely an all around great fun book i highly recommend this book	18
0	when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept i resolved that i would alert other readers generally i enjoy this author 's works and anticipated this latest tome i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it 's clues or probable developments everything was telegraphed and nothing was original the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next	18
0	i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book unfortunately i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard no character seems to even approach reality they are all including the main character and her love interest over the top	18
0	i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book his other books were so good i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be in applying some of the recommended techniques my 11 year old daughter emily thought i lost my mind thank goodness things are back to normal we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice	18

1	o'hara is one of the most underrated of american writers rage to live builds a strong character in grace caldwell tate her passions are handled with delicacy and skill and her story is told with a rare combination of affection and judgement a good place to begin with o'hara if you do n't know his work already	18
0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18

1	perfectly simple and indistinguishable from the real amazon except the price thanks for everything	18
0	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget i was wrong instead it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on all kinds of architectural extravagances perhaps this book could have a subtitle how to spend a million dollars on a 1 500 square foot house if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply this is the wrong book	18
1	in march 2006 there are only three or four books that boast haskell in their titles they are all excellent books but the world can benefit from more haskell books in fact we are in need of such books especially cs1 texts this book is a pleasure to read i suspect that even math haters will not find it hostile anyone learning haskell will find the book and its companion web site a valuable resouce on the web site you will find the source code from the book such as powerseries hs you can quickly play and experiment with it read and learn from it i wish more books are as pleasant and affordable \( 25 \)	18

0	i really want to like thich nhat hanh 's books i want to because people i respect like them because i believe in the value of mindful living but the truth is that i did n't find this book very helpful i have real and continuing struggles with anger and this book while interesting in a round about way is as others have mentioned not directed toward the problem of anger it is a mindful living remix i'm going to keep searching for a great tnh book and when i do i 'll recommend it good hunting	18
1	the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner so it caught my attention i honestly could not stop reading as yasmina khadra does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people 's humanity my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable that said it was still a very good ending that rings true spoiler if you wonder why she did n't come back consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street which led to them being stopped which ultimately resulted in her husband 's death i honestly ca n't wait to read more by yasmina khadra	18
1	jmaes joyce takes us on stephen daedalus' interior journey from pre teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of dublin struggling with sin salvation intellect ambivalence about his homeland and his father 's decline it is not a linear path but then whose is \? the story is not so much about the artist as a young man but about a young man 's journey to artistic sensibility its pretensions and exhilirations jaklak sez check it out	18

0	what to write \? the book is kinda story book and gives passages after passages if you are looking for a book that gives exercises to develop your psychic power this one 's not for you	18
0	seven times the sun is not for everyone it could be a springboard offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life but the songs poems and traditions offered in shea darian 's book are hokey and contrived at best cumbersome and artificial at worst none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book darian is a minister and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent true parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have but i'm just thankful amazon has a customer friendly return policy	18
1	americans who ca n't name five poets will name allen ginsberg in this case that is good since he was one of america 's greatest poets this book attest to this i write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint for the next edition i would like to see at least in limited edition a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow ginsbergs deserves better treatment	18
1	this is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice it is one of those books that is simply fun to read particularly to the wee ones at bed time the illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid very nice illustrations well done recommend this one highly	18
0	i have several dummies books from how to build a pc to ccna i had to read this rediculous book when i worked for a very well known dsl provider on the east coast this book was trivial assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly yes i agree hot bot is a pretty good search engine but it is not the only one out there this book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement easily the worst dummies book in print and im not being a jerk i love dummies books ron gilster rocks but this is absolute crap you can honestly get more informed with a magazine	18
1	a wonderful book you will meet many charming cats on your jounrey here that will stay with you forever although this book is only 150 pages it took me a long time to read it while many things made me smile or laugh out loud far too many things made me cry and i had to stop reading and set it aside for awhile i often wondered if i could even finish it but i am glad that i did it is a book that truly touches the heart	18

1	this town feels so typical at first the suburban couple husband with misc job and wife who 's good at parties the gem in cheever 's writing is to render these people and their neighbors with the true unique humanity and quirks we all possess sometimes cheever 's work can seem stereotypical everyone drinking gin and having weird suicidal urges this book though is a masterful blend of truly normal people and the creepy backstory that lives next door	18

0	i thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself however the truth is you need money to invest in real estate so there 's really no way around it which made her book redundant she just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies in the end the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth i really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties	18
0	i was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book but was disappointed if you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or do n't know how to track trends this book is for you if you are like me \( you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach \) i would n't buy the book	18
1	i am married to a native new yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions many of which we still visit today as an extra bonus for avid cooks there are recipes for anyone who remembers luchows or any of the other venerable now closed restaurants the book mentions it will take you back to happy times and good memories it 's an excellent book and clearly schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love	18

0	i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between quot wicca quot and quot witchcraft quot wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to quot chopping quot of source materials this is a waste of money	18
1	the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed they are art not just stories each story is deep in its unique complexities each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader 's mind and when i look back upon the book as a whole upon the adventurous stories the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely i ca n't help but be extremely impressed	18
1	newt gingrich presents common sense solutions to the pressing issues of our day in a clear concise and easily understood manner this book should be required reading for all civics and history classes in high school and college if the policies dr gingrich proposes could be implemented the us would not only become the shining city on a hill it would also become far and away the world 's most powerful economy throughout the next fifty years with prosperity for all americans who chose to join the ownership society he envisions	18

1	this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form political arm and unloving attitude this book is a real insight into the christian faith of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals especially those who were not self righteous but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives	18

0	i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the 3m cs100 stand i think it is a much better design	19

0	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money 's worth	19

1	opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone	19

0	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine \? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company	19

0	heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?	19
1	i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice	19

0	man were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we could n't figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it 's unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere \? \? \?	19

1	i bought this sd card and took some 100 snaps out of it the card is really fast with my canon a510 camera reading takes a slightly longer time than writing i would recommend this card to anyone actually this card outperforms the 16mb mmc supplied with the camera also the 256mb card will hold upto 200 \( may be lesser \) 3 2mp pictures	19

0	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality	19
1	they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably wo n't cut the cheese	19

0	it 's a super idea but i cannot say it works well getting a free station is a real challenge even in the underdeveloped italy and if you get one but you are driving within 5 minutes \( or 5 miles \) you lose the signal however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel is not good for cars but works at home connecting it to the radio it needs to be improved	19

1	i just got mine from amazon \( after a lengthly delay \) it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i 've already used up 600 mb its a must buy ! plus at 99 99 its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at 104 99 then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too	19
0	if there were a catagory for 0 stars that 's what i would have rated it i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter the radio works the cd works but the tv died after l month and the tv was the only part i was interested in what kind of product is this \? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit carol gruber	19
1	the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express this comes with a 2 meter rca ministereo a 2 meter optical ministereo and a 6ft power cable i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would 've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some	19
0	the only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection it is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3 player snugly but would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen	19
1	i have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my dell optiplex 260 running windows xp my poweredge 500sc 1400 and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted but this may be a function of running windows 2003 r2 on them also the 1800 has a promise sata card which locks up with usb in general making this switch a problem \( i had to go back to the ps2 kvm \) but with xp machines it seems fine	19

0	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19

0	i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you cannot rewind fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i cannot do anymore	19
1	one lvel up from the es30vs much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well remote control is easier to use than the last generation the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button i am very happy with this uni	19
1	turns out i do n't like in ear ear phones the sound on these is good though the bass is a bit much in my opinion the in ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world if you do like this style these are pretty good	19
1	great item picture great sound great connection choices great one problem being located about a foot away from an under cabinet radio the presence \( shut off \) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source ! or optionally move it at least three feet away which in our case is not practical very curious !	19
0	returned it would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients \( note the product does n't advertise support for mac \) why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers	19

1	i 've never had a problem with these dvds they burn and play perfectly and i 've never had a problem printing on them what 's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole it does n't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds	19
1	the only reason i did n't give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once so as of yet i ca n't call it a worthy 'road warrior ' however it is certainly a great case proportioned well and good design with space for essentials would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 widescreen notebook	19
0	got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall i need to purchase a 4 00 part and pay 5 00 shipping and taxes now all the specs say wall mountable not wall mountable with an extra purchase ! ok 8 10 is n't going to break me but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall ! so since i ca n't mount it on the wall i have n't used it yet ! have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in	19

0	i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers i bought 24 of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each i also have several high end chargers that do n't want anything to do with the ones that died on the bright side i have several lenmar dlcrv3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been a after 2 years	19
1	the product works great what i did n't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home it only came with the cigarette lighter power source i had to purchase the other power source seperately i also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources why is that	19
0	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it as you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of non functional when it comes to many small files i had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing stay away or if you really want one buy mine please	19

0	do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small ! \? the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom \( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! \?	19
1	the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off	19

1	i have been using this mouse at work since it came out after many miles of use the scroll wheel has finally started to fail i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls the best feature of this mouse is the battery life a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months but i usually got at least ten months out of mine i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them just to rub it in this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some but overall i would recommend it going to try a rechargable logitech next time around	19

1	this pny 2 0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife 's canon powershot s 900 elph to replace smaller memory cards although 1gb cards worked adequately with the elph we noticed early on that its 10 0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card the 2 0gb holds many more photos \( over 400 shots and counting \) than the 1gb at half the price of other brands the pny is proving to be very satisfactory \( we purchased two 2 0s at once \) we happily recommend the pny 2 0gb photo card for your photos it makes a great gift candidate get yours soon !	19

0	this printer does produce some fine output that is when it works the paper feed constantly refues to load paper the film scanner should have been left off all together \( not worth using \) i have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit \( read alot of negative reviews \) i have been a long time hp fan but after this experience i am going to look elsewhere my advice is to not even consider this printer	19

0	i 've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm did n't go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one \( kudos \) my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight wo n't light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough	19

0	i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista as a result of the windows upgrade this product just lost half its value for me the drive works fine physically but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling as others have noticed here western digital offers zero support for its software i cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem	19
1	its really works fine for my items as well as my son 's toys we both are happy with this	19
1	i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i'm very happy	19
0	i have this radio and it 's a pos remote is n't very responsive and the display is waaaay too bright \( will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person \) and the user interface is terrible the thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced ipod type radio on websites they are trying to get rid of it because it s cks ! ! ! ! ! !	19

0	i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don't buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by 9 00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i'm glad i did just do n't buy the disks from amazon	19
1	this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works greatsmallconvienientbad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wronghas to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way	19

0	i ordered this product and put it in my nikon d200 the product was improperly manufactured and caused the pins in my camera to bend rendering it inoperable i had no idea what the cause was and went to my camera store and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well we took a quick look at the card and the holes were obviously improperly aligned the damage to the cameras was repairable and the replacement card i received worked ok but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment	19

0	i bought this because i wanted a cheap no frills phone with answering system but it 's performed very poorly compared with the one i had previously specifically it 's very hard to hear anything on this phone even with the volume set to maximum definitely not worth buying	19
0	some of the worst dvds that i have purchased i would n't waste my money on any more of these pos discs i wish i could return them to amazon but for what i paid \( it was pretty cheap \) its not worth the effort	19

1	this photo paper is truly top of the line profession grade paper i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints and they always turn out great	19
1	when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others personally its usually red it has caught me with my pants down a couple times going to print out a project the night before its due only to run out of red or blue ink i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case	19
0	i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a 5 credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth 5 he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but do n't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	19

0	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i'm very disappointed and i'm returning it	19

0	i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i'mnot willing to chance it again	19
0	i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about 20 of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270 this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda	19
1	this is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer all in one this unit can protect your sensitive high end audio system computers and video moniters from everyday power surges power sags over voltages and brown outs these surges pick away at your sensitive equipment taking years off their useful life i own and highly recommend this unit	19

0	do n't believe the claim that you can just plug it in and it 's ready to use this product is set up for windows and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software it 's easy to become hopelessly fouled up do n't expect any help from western digital if you can actually get connected to them and your call is n't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so you 'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive their web site help is equally useless	19

0	the one i ordered works but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit i received has a slightly flawed location the nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle \( outlet \) my nub is slightly too high preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet because of this nub it 'll only work in the bottom outlet i see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place	19
1	since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone \( esp with caller id \) this phone is tops this phone and all other at t phones corded or cordless exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable given the other choices this is the one to get	19

1	i have and have had lots of sw radios including a number of sonys this is one of their many gems great perfomance lots of memories and snazzy look good for travel \( certainly not as compact as the sw100 of course \) a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio and do n't want to spend very much good for listening and good for dxing while traveling look no further	19

1	cool ! i can expand my single usb port laptop more flexible from single peripheral to be quadruplet i can plug flashdisk mouse external and digital camera in same time worth money for usefull gadget	19
1	i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but did n't measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds	19
1	it was easy to set up and use our remote was bad out of the box but panasonic sent us a replacement we were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old vhs over to dvd it took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the vhs tapes again to bring back memories	19
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over 6 00 amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !	19
1	i 've used everything from ableton live to protools to reason and this thing is just plug and play very easy interface makes for no brainer recording i'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it 's all about the song the sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles fantastic product guys and for the money it 's a steal	19
1	i lost my monster cable brand m to m cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price plugged everything in and it works super good sound quality and saved some bucks hard to find these cables so i highly recommend it	19

1	bought it for my wife and she loves it it keeps track of where you were and restarts from there the display is small \( no fancy menus like ipod \) but works well sound is excellent be sure to install the drivers and software the software is small simple and easy to use or you can just copy paste files onto it if you don't install the drivers it only works at usb 1 1 speeds and takes a lot longer to load songs with drivers you get full 2 0 speeds	19
1	i purchased this so my pc could share a monitor with my xbox360 does the job at a cheap cost ! so easy to use that my 4 yr old can use it	19

0	this is a terrible product if you can get it to print the labels look great but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find i get an error that it did n't print but no reason why i 've installed on two different pcs one is brand new and same thing happens software is also pretty useless it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive the online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond	19
1	i bought this cd player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully ! when you consider what a fine cd player it is and the incredibly low price it is most certainly a best buy !	19

0	i purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their tv 's to watch programs rather than listen to music reception was horrible ! ! ! while i was in the gym i tried just listening to the radio and could n't even get that to come in clear the only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies ! not impressed at all ! i will be returning this and maybe buy the 12 generic set instead	19
0	i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be 110 for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that 110 i have other eight \( 8 \) lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i 'll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one	19
1	radio shack wanted 39 95 for a similar item so at 9 95 this was a steal swr is good and performance is as much as i need for corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what i need i did have to put a metal plate on the vette \( discreetly \) as it would n't stick to the fiberglass good produc	19

0	this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one would n't play the disc one would n't eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work	19

1	i 've had canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and wo n't settle for any of those knock offs yeah they 're often much cheaper but this is one area where you get what you pay for brand x fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system this has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading pc magazine i have had to install and remove countless cartridges and never spilled a drop the pop in pop out design could n't be easier	19
0	this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	19

1	this lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out well worth while if you 're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder	19
1	when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it !	19
1	i received them ok none broken or cracked this price beats walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases i have ever used i like the translucent back better than the black ones at staples	19

0	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	19
1	ca n't say enough of this machine i view all dvd 's in hidef now and that is a beautiful thin	19
0	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p o s ! !	19
1	also at an awesome price i am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one i have needs to be replaced	19
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs i bought this lens cleaner and voila ! the recorder is working again super easy to use \( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do \) highly recommended	19
1	this is a great card for a laptop however they need to correct their problems with the installer for xp also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line once you do get to them they fix the problem right away seems they know it will not install correctly then it works great	19
1	do n't let the size fool you i do n't know much about audio yet but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using much crisper with out all the fuzziness and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending i am sure the 600 mic is great but this is doing every thing i need	19
1	if you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one replacing the provided headphones is a good idea fm reception a little weak but the tape play time on one aa battery is amazing lightweight and good quality for the price	19
1	in comparison to the component cables the quality is a little better i do n't think i agree with those who say you must have hdmi cables to get a good picture but i am extremely satisfied with the product and i do n't regret purchasing it amazon 's price for this product is unmatched	19

1	i totally love this cd wallet it is not too big and not too small the construction of this piece is very sturdy i 've owned this for a while now and it still looks new the color is a classic the only problem i have with it is that the cd pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable i love it ! ! ! i actually bought another one oh another note do be careful because the if you do n't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught but nothing major	19
0	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1 2 the mile the battery does n't hold full charge i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range	19
0	this is a good product not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory as it is bulkier but it is great for the price the only drawback is it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory running with it can be uncomfortable at times if you are a runner you may prefer a smaller mp3 player one you can put in your shorts pocket	19
1	i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years this is the best mouse i 've ever owned it is fast accurate well formed and constructed i would definitely recommend it the dpi adjustment is a nice touch i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy this mouse is just right	19
1	this was a perfect fit for my 13 macbook tried a couple cheaper ones but was never satisfied usually they were just a bad fit this is by far the best holds the computer in place and is light weight it 's true you get what you pay for one complaint the extra pocket in front could be larger	19
1	i saw the small size of this case and was in love it has plenty of space for dvds and cords \( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold \) it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky it 's great you wont regret it	19
1	i purchased this particular cb because of the front firing speaker the size is perfect for in dash installations and it is very user friendly after installation i tested it out to 8 miles which was more then i expected overall i'm very pleased with the price and quality of this product	19
0	i did not receive the correct product that i ordered i informed the seller and he stated that i would need to resell on ebay myself very disappointed with his service kell	19
0	i use to love maxtor still have one from 1999 so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers well the darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone i did have a lot of it backed up but still what a pain now that seagate owns them spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive or get a couple of these and raid them but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping	19
0	i bought the terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some am and fm radio stations i was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system perhpas because of my apartment building or the quality of the stereo the antenna did n't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory provided antenna i did notice improvement in the static \( or lack of it \) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well \( they went from great to excellent \) but the stations that were tuning in quot poorly quot got no better with the terk antenna overall it was probably not worth the money paid	19
0	along with reception of new hd stations i expected high quality fm am to go with my complete top line stereo system instead the hdt 1 gives me very poor quality even less than a table top clock radio very high output can only turn amp up to lowest level and painful to listen to no response to inquiries from sangean	19
1	you really ca n't go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 \? on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen \? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system \( this is how my daughter has it configured \) it 's our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm \( yes the circuit was 'protected' but so what \) could n't be happier for the investment	19
0	when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support ! if you read the boards on the linksys site you 'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp 's and areas of the us since this item has been released please do n't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage you 'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through	19
0	while i'm driving this thing does n't work at all there 's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still maybe it 's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter ca n't reach it overall i 'd say this product is garbage	19
0	june 04 2006i purchased this radio for emergency purposes however it seems to be very week i am a double amputee and am confined to a wheel chair i depend on my radio to raise help but i am afraid this one will not be dependable i am not asking for them to be returned or for a refund just letting you and your customers know of a very weak product and i could not reccomend this product to anyone cobra was the tops in radios but something has happened to the quality thank you for listening william hembreewmhembree aol com	19
0	it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk 512mb transflash card was shipped from emartbuy and i still have not received my order when i contacted emartcrap all they could tell me was that it had been shipped i am sure that flash card works great i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete avoid emartbuy at all cost do n't settle for incompetency your are better off paying a higher price for better service correction any service	19
1	solid product headphone speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted 40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed ! i bought this great little unit instead for under 30 good audio actually it saved my laptop once too laptop fell from 2 3 feet but landed right on the rubberized turtle beach micro which took most of the force it was bent 90 degrees at the usb connector but it still worked ! proof of solid construction	19
0	the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i'm using the plextor dvd burner \( love it ! ! \) but i'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters	19
0	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
0	i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6db on the box the performance was worse than the original 2db antenna that came with my wireless adapter back it goes	19
0	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter i obviously purchased a lemon have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period how 's that for sound logic i really like it when it works but unfortunately an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button	19
1	this product is fantastic great sound with a small footprint i purchased a jbl on stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days the cta product has been great and it cost a lot less than the jbl product	19
1	jensen jm10 anonymous review i love these headphones ! ! the easy access volume control is right where i need it and i can turn it on and off whenever i need to they are a great value ! the headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great the sound quality is clear and crisp the single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all i would recommend it to all my friends	19
0	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger it works fine however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me 1 the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case 2 the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 better sound quality	19
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player but after the first week the earphone input \( hole in the player \) did n't hold the input jack securely resulting in no sound i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second but could not get it to work continuously unfortunately i threw away my receipt and box or i would return it	19
0	i find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable i would rate the product a zero if it were an option i ca n't even use them because they 're too uncomfortable to wear not worth the money even though they 're cheap	19
1	i ca n't say enough about the tivoli am fm radio ! it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well some folks might be hesistant to spend over 100 for a radio trust me it is well worth it my girlfriend 's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years still sounds great	19
0	sound was n't too bad for price tinny yes but cheap used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play cds and then it would n't turn on at all	19
1	my doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because i had previous carpal tunnel surgery ilove the way it comforts the wrist the gel inside is different than other gel pads i had in the past it really does give great support and comfort it can prevent future problems for your wrist iam glad amazon carries it	19
0	this product has a known defect for serial numbers r641 and less \( see logitech website \) i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r635 it will be sent back tomorrow hopefully amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base	19
0	what a lousy battery used it on my clock and it leaked i would never use it again	19
0	i had this card for more than 6 months and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 transfers went well too then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago my sd usb converter could n't find the card either i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good what a joke	19
0	good product forget about service i e mailed infocus about my faulty projector 8th january 2005it is now 7th january 2006 and i still do not have my projector that 's right it 's been one year sincemy projector stopped working i have given up on it being repaired \( it was under warranty \) and am nowstruggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket check this company 's record atthe better business bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints	19
0	my title is my review the thing worked for a week after that it would n't power up anymore chinese junk	19
0	i would love to try this first one was shipped broken \( make a clanking noise and woulnd't work \) sent it back and got a new one that did n't read a dvd i may try one more time its pretty heavy but i am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i pod type machines	19
1	this is a great product for your mini the armband is well constructed from a neoprene type material \( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty \) with heavy duty velcro all the way around and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance this is n't a super cheap armband but as they say you \( usually \) get what you pay for this should last you for years of gymming running biking	19
0	i ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area wrong ! ! the light is so dim the only thing it might be good for is a night light ! this lamp is a good idea but much too weak to be of any help	19
0	i would like to believe that this hub works well but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info \( 5 volt 2 1 amp center positive \) i 've been to two radio shacks and online they do n't carry it i'm upset any advice	19
1	having a bad view of the southern sky i needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio it maded all the difference great product and it came with 30 ft of cable	19
0	i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices \( all had the same description and specs \) it worked for about 2 weeks and then quit a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose since then it has come loose twice more so i just do n't use it anymore when it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution	19
0	either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me i needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item	19
0	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck	19
1	i use this scanner primarily for text documents and could n't be more impressed you do need text software i have textbridge but i find relatively few errors in the scan proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient best of all i do n't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk caution i have n't used it for photos but it does a great job on text	19
1	this notebook case is a perfect fit for the macbook and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags it is exactly what i was looking for	19
1	this thing is selling in the best buy with 53 33 tax i bought that in here for under 40 with free super saver shipping in jan it 's working very well until now with my sonyericsson k800i	19
0	do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card \( rpsdh01gu1a \) and what i got was a low quality high speed card \( rpsdk01gu1a \) seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon 's blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon 's partners and amazon will do nothing to help you	19
1	for this price these are a steal ! purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it ! the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too ! so you can use them for cd players and amps ! the sound quality is good and the headphones do n't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i'm honestly surprised these ar n't marked for 50 do n't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones	19
1	i 've been using these earbuds for several months now and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod they 're more comfortable and there 's so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! \( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though \) i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength	19
0	this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy there is constant static and clicking in the background making it hard to hear the person on the other end to make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones both obnoxiou	19
0	first i rated it great and it was for two movies then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling the end	19
1	works well for my mac and bt enabled sony ericsson phone other than the built in drivers for the printer in mac osx support for options within the card and printer are non existant still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges	19
0	i'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it i have found samsung products to be very good i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription i already am paying costs for two radios i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account consequently i returned the product without using it	19
0	the card was defective have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works hopefully wo n't have to keep doing this too many times have already wasted a lot of time on this pretty frustrating	19
1	i love my tooldial and its' software my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in design a little overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet	19
1	i bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work when i hooked up the cable between my laptop and tv wow this is really worth a buy	19
0	i'm sure it would work well somewhere just not for our small business i put it behind an adsl router and used it to authenticate pppoe it was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected after hours on the phone with tech support from linksys and the dsl router people nobody could help while it connected it did work very well it just did stay up too bad	19
0	true to its name it has high sensitivity too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live start moving in all directions on my couch the mouse is dead if the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive but when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck the paws foot of the mouse is sticky not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse i am returning this product even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen	19
1	i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office the reception on this unit is great bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound	19
1	after reading several reviews on this unit we purchased it the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to get in the game it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it all i can say is wow ! the performance is phenomenal we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works i cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid highly recommended	19
0	it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony 's compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc30	19
0	in general i 've been happy with belkin accessories but this cable is the pits it lasted less than a month ! i used it to connect my hd dvr cable box to my receiver no crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent i do n't like to support the monster cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one so far no problems	19
0	would of been great to receive so i could of gotten some use of i	19
1	i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price \( i 've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past \) these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands not surprisingly the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor 716a drive i have n't tested a whole lot yet but the ones i did test burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run there were no errors you really ca n't go wrong with verbatim just buy them	19
0	o k i purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now these batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives i do n't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these did n't last being on the shelf for a little over a year i will never buy this brand again	19
0	this card is such a disappointment it is soooo sloooooow i use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq it takes forever to copy anything to and from it	19
1	excellent value for money my razr is a fully functional mp3 player now ! thanks	19
1	first time i 've ever written a review i'm not a high tech type and sometimes it 's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff this remote was a breeze to program and works fantastic my wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it any problems with use just press help and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem highly recommended	19
1	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case what i received is what i expected lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane other than that it was a good purchase for the price	19
0	these blank discs are defective i was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them the maxell blank discs that i have did the job fine	19
0	if you do n't use the printer on a daily basis these cartridges dry up only days after you stop given that the bjc 80 is a portable printer i only use it while traveling which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip a real money drain	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
0	nice product before they decided to save a few pennies i have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' not ! 5 stars if it still had the handle or if you do n't need one	19
1	i have n't had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it	19
1	got 3 of them a few months ago and buying another one now excellent product fits many different plug types no flaws	19
0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
0	it did n't match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player \( i know i 'll be refunded the price of the first changer \) but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss	19
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone this does not work on a mac	19
1	i got the griffin itrip to enjoy my ipod in my car and then i had to get a belkin tunebase for ipod mini ! with the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the itrip the tunebase keeps my ipod charged so that i do n't have to plug it into my computer 's usb port every night after work	19
1	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases other than that it ca n't be beat for the price and quality adorama rocks	19
1	this mount is perfect ! it sticks well to the windshield keeps the gps rock steady it allows you to swing to driver center and passenger 's views and back without any bending or remounting i am very pleased ! my roadmate looks a 100 better on this mount i hated the mount that came with the gps the build quality of this mount also seems to be very good i would highly recomend this mount	19
0	the description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in rugged conditions in reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber i suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling	19
1	my husband and father both have this unit it 's really handy to have on road trips and to use while geocaching from our experience it does take a while to download map information onto the unit and a color screen would be nice but for 200 i think it 's a good value	19
1	great sound fun colored lights great design love this radio	19
0	this item produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x5 is entirely useless the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger i returned mine immediately if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed ill fitting unacceptable piece of worthless junk	19
0	the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours not 60 there is no hands free speakerphone if you use a standard plug in headset the microphone does not work \( tested two units \) there is more the headset is very loud \( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear \) but there is no volume adjustment the microphone has low sensitivity so you find yourself yelling into it the clock resets itself when the power is turned off i returned mine	19
1	i bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and i use italmost every day so far so good i do n't expect to have any problems with it i used to have a small wacom graphire and i used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now i own a new onethe only advice i can give to you is to keep it clean wipe it out every now and then with a wet clothjo	19
1	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	19
1	this wall mount works and hold 's great i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems the instructions are not all that clear but it is not hard to figure out how to instal	19
0	as the title it not worth the money at all even at such a low price the picture quality is bad very bad i 'd rather spend this money for other web cam	19
1	after 8 months of thinking these \( foam inserts that came with my e3c 's \) will last forever i broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty whoa ! the new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened my great sound and comfort was back and the decay was so gradual i did n't even realize what i was missing ! so 5 stars for performance but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs avg 4stars	19
0	very very not user friendly no instruction to install worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house decided to resell it could be its only because i'm apple illeterate	19
0	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1 1 water and rubbing alcohol handy it 's cheaper and more effective	19
0	j r packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival	19
0	terrible user interface you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features pulls multiple papers through so you must start again is a g3 which you would think would be compatible with earlier non g3 fax machines wrong so you ca n't fax to 75 of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use and much less expensive save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon this product was a disaster	19
0	i purchased the dlo action jacket \( neoprene for 20 40gb ipods \) for my wife for use on walks etc around town however the ipod does n't fit in properly the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod 's does n't the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and does n't align either so you ca n't press the play button so since the ipod does n't fit in the case overall this product is useless pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case	19
0	this is the same unit that hp sells but has lite on do its support great unit for about a month support is not good	19
1	i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for herhp pavilion notebook pc \( dv5139us \) screen size 15 4 ht 1 8 wdth 14 1 depth 10 4 the bag is for personal use not business and use will be moderate she did want some extra compartments for organization this case has met all her needs it is light weight constructed of durable material well organized her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease she is satisfied with this purchase we would recommend purchasing this case	19
0	i also was misled into thinking i was getting ten of these tapes not one while the tape is ok it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic vhs tape i am usually a big amazon fan but this advertisement is very poor	19
0	these xtreme cd cases stinks literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away nope finally i threw it away other than the smell quality wise it is ok	19
1	basically this backpack is all that i need in a back pack very well padded very roomy fits an hp pavillion dv8000 17 laptop its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear definately worth the unlike my previous packpacks the straps adjust so quickly and easily that i adjust them every time i put the pack on or take it off great product ! ! !	19
1	this keyboard is the best i 've ever used the backlight is excellent and the keys just have that unique touch that just soothes your fingers great and cool design i recommend this keyboard all the way ! im typing on it right now by the way	19
0	for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children \? it 's going back	19
0	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company	19
0	this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera \( but the fuji and sandisk product did	19
1	i purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up this mic was inexpensive and works fine so far we have n't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time	19
0	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to \( i have several lexmark products \) i returned the printer	19
0	i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint	19
0	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp wo n't do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i'm sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts	19
1	i have been looking for a larger cf card for my dell axim x50v the seagate cf drive does not work finally i got this working for this price i think it 's good	19
1	i just made a long trip from miami florida all the way to s carolina with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 everything worked just fine i installed the software unlock it upload the maps all with out any problems the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard from inside the vehicle worked very well never took more than a minute to track all satellites the street route where very accurate never got lost working with poi 's was very simple did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit	19
0	n e w will waste your time money and your every last nerve before repairing your product eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight	19
0	the product shipped is not the same as the picture apparently this is a common thing for this item	19
0	just a heads up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them given the verbiage on the box it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner i'm not ok with deception like that	19
1	this is extremely high quality photo paper best used in canon photo printers the 13 by 19 is used best with the canon i9000 printer series with a web of 13 this paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality	19
0	maybe mine was broken but i do n't think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter	19
0	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small now i am stuck with something i cannot use your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened how is one to know unless they open it	19
0	i just wasted 16 35 on this piece of junk it arrived quickly and became unusable even faster for those of you used to disposable screen covers there is only one in this package ! the instructions say you can clean it but it came out of the packaging with lint on it which immediately adhered to the sticky side and could not be cleaned off since the package was opened it could not be returned	19
0	the worst customer service i have ever experienced the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said you got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect \? viking cheats so what \?	19
1	i 've seen others coaster from day 1 and i 've seen others coaster after day 60 \( after an actual succesfull write ! \) but these are absolutely awesome highly reliable long term	19
0	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser i got my daughter one as a gift gave it to her bran new in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty \( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything \)	19
1	these fit over everything very well and they stayed put without stretching out which is why my original pads fell off i guess it 's one of those products that you ca n't do much better than 10 for but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something	19
0	agree with the prior message i was duped into thinking 10 vhs tapes were being sold don't order this	19
1	elegant design sturdy construction supports my yamaha sy35 securely after reading the forbidding reviews i decided to assemble it without first reading the directions it took me 10 min	19
1	not a bad product but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well no matter where the antenna is positione	19
1	i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an quot abc quot book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use	19
0	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	19
1	i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable and it is awesome ! the tranfer rate using the usb 2 0 cable to the psp is very good and i love having all that storage space for movies music and images i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests and i have to agree the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp for an extra 5 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance i think it is well worth it	19
0	the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded	19
0	i experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod i was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my tv out signal to on it did n't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting	19
0	the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks	19
1	i 've never had any problems with memorex dvd 's or cd 's when i was ordering and read some of the reviews here i had to go back and look at what i was using to make sure i 've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones i do n't know why some users are having problems but these dvd 's always worked great for me and i record on average over one a day	19
1	great item powered off laptop its fans work quietly to keep laptop cool so you can actually us your lap without fear of overheating your computer an inexpensive solution to preventing costly repairs wish i'd purchased earlier as i already fried my cd dvd drive and had to replace them good product targus	19
1	it 's a usb hub all i ask is that it works it does	19
0	i ordered the cobra hg a1500 high gear cb antenna they keep sending the cobra hg a1000 now i'm stuck with a antenna i did not order nor do i want	19
1	best price i have ever seen for this product and free shipping to boot !	20
0	i hate to rate something so low but my experience warrants a low score the larger burner was defective from the onset the knob turned but the burner remained on and at full it seemed regardless of the knob 's setting i had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on the smaller burner worked ! amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well packing seemed fine too guess it was a manufacturing defect hopefully this does n't happen to many others	20
1	by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non stick pans it 's already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface	20
1	works great can use easily and waffles taste great ! my kids could live on waffles if i would let them and this is an asset to have in any kitchen makes extra light and fluffy waffles	20
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she did n't keep the receipt so i'm writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries i do n't buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands	20
1	looks great just what i wanted i ca n't believe i have filled it up already \( i feel like such a chef	20
0	i have two cats both less than 5 months old i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that 's way over priced my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic save your money and use it on something more useful	20
1	a little disappointing we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we 've had for umpteen years and still works like new we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced we 've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it	20
1	this is my first electric litter box i have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up it really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box it was a breeze to set up i also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor and with the tent they ca n't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a bm on the floor i'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down	20
0	will work fine if you only use a few light coats not designed for a family of four in a colder region it 's now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it 's hooks now shopping for a new one looked nice in the oak	20
1	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20
0	i expected better durability out of this fan it died after just 3 months and had flow problems from day one i tried contacting lasko but got no responses	20
0	do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service	20
1	this is my first grill pan and it work very well i have only cooked chicken on it so far and i have found that i like the way tenders cook better then really thick chicken breasts	20
1	gorgeous unique useful ! i bought this as a gift and it is the recepient 's favorite great gift do not hesitate buy now !	20
0	it looked okay when i opened it then i washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of cranberry colored lint \( wet in the washer and dry in the dryer \) the next time i washed it was better but still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer it is not warm enough alone it might be okay in the warmer months but not what i expected for winter	20
1	this is my second panasonic and i love it it is simple to use and does a great job	20
1	we use it as supplemental heat in our apartment raises the temp of our entire 1000 sq ft apartement about 10 degrees with no problem \( our landlords have the thermostat \) however check the shipping price shipping nearly doubled the price on the item	20
1	this is the cutest comforter not the softest buy my son loves it ! i had n't been able to get him to sleep in his own bed all night but as soon as we got this it was no problem he loves to sleep in his 'thomas' bed !	20
1	this is a great pan i have a larger one but this one fits in my pressure cooker makes a wonderful cream cheese cake in the pressure cooker	20
1	this sweeper is a real bargain it makes a perfect backup for a full blown vacunm \( it is a little iffy on hard wood floors \) well designed and easy to use	20
1	this is a good bat house but does n't come with a pole i would recomend buying a pole or just hanging it somewhere	20
0	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan	20
1	works great ! easy to pump it would be nice if there were a clear window to let you know when you need to refill	20
0	when you first unwrap these sheets they look and feel great but the true test is once they 've been washed a few times they do n't hold up at all they pill after only a couple of washings and are thin and flimsy i was really looking forward to giving these a great review but i ca n't	20
0	saucepan made in indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely there was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit it was in the construction of the pan as a long time user of revere ware we were very disappointed in this product sent to us we will never purchase another revere ware product once burned we will not go back to a second treatment	20
0	poor workmanship rusted inside of chrome cover \( is it really chrome with rust on it \) very poor construction of the rubber piece and is smells like rubber i really do n't want to smell rubber in my closet	20
0	this wok is heavy and unbalanced it can tip while on the element the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task the flat bottom is n't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir frying if i wanted to saut i 'd have gotten a saut pan the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere you need lots of counter space as well this wok just is n't large enough for stir frying for more than two people	20
0	the rubbermaid chrome dish drainer arrived in a timely fashion however the utensil holder was not included i promptly contacted the seller by email their representative apologized profusely in her response and assured me that the utensil holder would arrive promptly two weeks later i did not have a utensil holder and i had received no further communication from the company i plan to return the item and dispute the charge on my credit card i also have found the same item under a different brand name for a cheaper price at bed bath and beyond	20
0	i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i 'd buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one	20
0	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better itemlight and not providing the warmth expected from this price level feels incomplet	20
1	this whale is so much fun i got it for when my sisters kids came down they had a hard time staying on it though but it was fun for me it was such a hit i have two now they got one for me before they left saying now you gots two so next time we come you can ride too overall great strong and fun	20
1	love the soup bowls they live up to the usual fiestaware quality as all of the other products from fiestaware so pick your color and enjoy	20
0	i purchased four of these pillows ! i really should n't have wasted my money they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up i 'd rather sleep without a pillow at all ! !	20
1	this is wonderful i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me i actually enjoy working with this the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this	20
1	the one touch pet gate 150 is excellent ! i matches my hardwood floor and is attractive i especially like that the door swings both ways for easy accessibility	20
1	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully i am very pleased with my purchase !	20
1	this is hands down the best hair removal tool on the market it grabs an astounding amount of undercoat and topcoat hair just one usage of it on my dog cut his shedding by at least 75 regarding the complaints yes hair will go all over the place but that 's stated in the instructions use it in an area where you can sweep or vacuum	20
1	saw a demo of this at a local sur la table and very impressed the coffee it makes is outstanding i plan to buy one later this year amazon is being deceptive about price they state list price is 2400 and they 're selling it for 1798 95 at a savings of 601 05 not ! look at the jura capresso website the list for the impressa f9 is 1799 that brings amazon 's big discount down to a whole 0 05 the higher end impressa s9 is 2399 \( and amazon claims it is 3200 \) do your research do n't trust amazon 's claims for msrp	20
0	while cute this little pan is difficult to use there 's no room to use a spatula so you 'd better like the eggs cooked through you ca n't flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it 's so small that it wo n't fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers	20
1	i absolutely adore these kyocera knives they are the sharpest things i have ever seen i ordered this through witbecks and the first one got lost in the mail that can always happen when i contacted matt witbeck he responded immediately \( that night from home \) and the next day sent me a replacement i have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service and so i want to recommend witbecks to anyone	20
0	i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing	20
0	i bought a haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months i called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one i have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing do not buy anything from this company their products are cheap chinese junk and they do not stand behind their products do n't believe me \? look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and zero customer support	20
0	i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad 's sunbeam silex type coffeemaker it made great coffee and so does the bodum problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem	20
1	yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it	20
1	this is a strudy well built product it was very easy to install i did it in 15 minutes my wife loves it now she has a lot more room in her sewing room we opted to paint it but it can be stained also we reccommend it highly	20
0	i dont recoment you to buy this product i dont under stand why they made i	20
0	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	functionally this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner it is not attractive to look at however my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish the varnish is very high gloss and the knobs are low grade mismatched junk i believe the build is solid but only time will tell final word pay the extra money for a hand crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally this just is n't worth 300	20
1	have had the granos for about 1 month great espresso great latte and great design i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved but only time will tell	20
1	sturdy well made spatula perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks for the price you just ca n't go wrong	20

1	i 've been wanting a knife sharpener for decades but just could n't justify spending over one hundred dollars on one when wa la i discovered the wusthof 2904 model on amazon ! it 's so easy to use and while the scissor sharpener does take some practice it 's wonderful to have useable kitchen shears and regular scissors once again ! sheryl california	20
0	very bad quality not worth to buy it it is not as good as the picture do n't buy it ! !	20
0	this product is ok it 's just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint catching fabric the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast but for what it is this attachment is ridiculously overpriced	20
0	this unit can only dry half of what it can wash which is not that much it takes a total of 4 1 2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in i have a family of five and i am over run with laudry because of this machine ! !	20
0	beware ! on off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged the place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it 's been about 2 weeks	20
1	after failing to find a simple easy to use travel clock in local stores i decided to search online and got this one even though it 's inexpensive the craftmanship is n't shoddy all the parts fit together well and are easy to adjust parts of it glow in the dark \( including the hands number marks and pop up part that lets you know that you set the alarm \) it 's very quiet and does n't take up much space if only more things in life were like this great little clock	20
1	i just love my new multi tasking opener i have arthritis and it was difficult to open jars and this has been a life saver	20

1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party it was the talk of the whole school the kids loved it i used sephra chocolate \( a coupon was included \) so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression the cascading flowing chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine i also saved 25 00 by buying the chp \( champaigne color \) version	20
0	i rate this set very poor in less than six months the face cloth has holes in it the towel absorption is ok	20
0	i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies	20
1	i was very pleased with how quick i received my purchase i had looked for a long time for bunny cake pan	20
1	i bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of calphalon forged kitchen knives that i recently purchased i have used oriental water stones in the past and this stone is as good as any i have used with just a few strokes it will turn a calphalon henckles or wusthof into a gillette with this stone and a good steel your knives will last far beyond your years	20

1	i really like these glasses the glass really does make a difference sometimes i 'll probably next purchase their red glasses	20
0	it works fine but my cat wo n't use it i was thrilled with the reviews i read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived unfortunately i like it better than my cat does he largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass oh well before you buy make sure it 's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat this fountain has no water sound \( pretty quite actually \) i think that 's why my cat ignores it	20
0	i ordered the product and thought i was getting the large size i called the shipper no returned calls and i ca n't really use the item shipped as i needed the large item how do i return the shipper does n't return the calls not a happy customer of this product	20
0	i placed a substantial order mattresses sofa set table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was too much nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio	20
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive	20
0	the add said it would seperate small berry seeds the holes on the smallest grate are about 1 8 you could fit 20 seed through one of them very disappointing	20
0	this electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last five electric blankets we have purchased however it stopped working within a month like the other four who makes a realiable electric blanket \? not sunbeam and not this brand since the texture on this one is nice we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket	20
1	i have ordered two of these from this vendor both times the product was received almost a month after i ordered it the product is nice and of good construction but again if you need this in a hurry choose another place because they dont know how to mail it right out	20
0	amazon is out of red after waiting for 2 months they shipped a white while the packing list states red when contacted they said that they do not have a red for replacement if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for 7 99 not i have to go through the trouble of returning it	20
1	it was nice to be able to purchase just one mug the delivery was quick	20
0	bought one it quit working within 6 weeks the litter box lid never did fit correctly and the unit just stopped running littermaid sent a replacement the lid on the replacement would n't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment after some fine tuning the unit worked for three days before quitting perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived the units i have bought and received are useless as it is i'm out 170 with no hope of a fix	20
0	for the price you get what you pay for they are not the best quality	20
1	great all around microwave for singles the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn	20
1	wife loves this contraption if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall easy to clean and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when i purchased one sweet cup it comes with is great quality peace !	20
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it does n't spill any thing	20
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully	20
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	20
0	this is not even a toy do not waste your money on this item amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a quick machine nothing about this machine functions well never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches amazon should not carry this item it has lowered the quality of amazon 's products in my view	20
1	cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you 'll have bases covered	20
1	i love these glasses i think the traditional stemmed wine glass is fine but i find this far more practical while being elegant at the same time i have the set for sauvignon blanc as well which are very nice i 'll be buying more	20
0	poor suction air filter cloggs every time and it shuts down after 15 min use dont buy	20
0	cat kept peeing on laundry tried this product no change the only thing that worked was constant cleaning changing of litter maybe this works for other cats but not mine	20
0	mazon i ordered 4 for xmas dinner was sent three and they cancelled the 4th one saying the will never get it in thanks amazon	20
1	it is just like having a diaper genie for babies makes it much cleaner	20
1	i was impressed when i received this case for my fiance 's christmas present as i began cramming the body pillow into it i was happy to find a zipper at the opening all of the other body pillows i 've had inevitably fall out of the case thus offering little support during the night when you 're not awake to notice it 's very thick and seems durable i recommend it	20
0	i was very excited with such a inexpensive purchase for high count sheets but very soon i learned it was not such a great deal beware if using them on an older mattress which is not thick ! after putting on the fitted sheet it looked like a huge skin on a baby elephant ! loose material everywhere my real complaint is the pills which appeared only a few days into use they snag on rings watch bracelets etc i would never purchase this material again	20
1	this scale is quite accurate and easy to read the only problem may be that it can be a little touchy when trying to adjust the needle in order to use a different container	20
1	it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before	20
1	i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly does n't make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it 's way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it !	20
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly i feel we made a good choice	20
0	sent it back could n't see the read out with a plate or saucer on the scale needs a tilted or canted face	20
1	i love this item perfect for storing pet food special screw type tops that seals food bugs mice cannot get in easy to wash let it air dry my only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it so those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed over all the best in food storage i know i just about bought them all	20
0	i loved this while it worked this worked great for the first 2 times we used it after that it would n't work it has a 6 month warranty so i am in the process of getting if fixed	20
0	my order was cancel because company will not ship to a fpo fpaddress really unclear as to the reason but i am sure it isa fine product my turtles will continue to bask on their rock	20
1	i got this wok for christmas as a gift it is perfect you are able to cook just about anything on this at a high heat without worrying that the food will stick to the bottom of the pan it is easy to clean so far i have cooked stir fries and potatoes with chorizo each time the food came out perfect not undercooked or over cooked	20
0	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it 's pure crap stay away ! !	20
0	i ordered this griddle and on the third use the teflon coating burned off onto my glasstop stove i called faberware directly since i was out of my return period and after explaining my situation they sent me another \( different model \) griddle free of charge the first product didnt work out but the mfgr made good	20
0	toaster was defective had to send it back cost me 20 in shipping and i have nothing to show for it	20
0	just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them	20
0	this product does not work the dial just moves randomly please tell me who to contact for a refund	20
1	bought this opener because i was tired of trying to open tall cans with an average size electric opener not only does it open cans that are taller but it does it with ease locks on can top stays on through entire cycle my last opener would often get half way through the can and miss spot before juming off track not this one ! i am very pleased	20
1	this is the fourth piece of furntiure i have bought from this line \( mission natural \) i love it i have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center but use them as night stands it fits my 1950 's contemporary home perfectly price is great delivery even better i ordered on a saturday night and received it by tuesday noon i could n't ask for more	20
1	it 's as absorbent as advertised and the color is much better than the photos	20
1	this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces	20
0	the lcd display do not work right line are missing from the display	20
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top i was sent new doors but they did n't fit frustrated i accepted the promised 175 00 off to keep the doors knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later i have yet to receive this refund the delivery was also a major problem there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone so i tipped him to bring it in for me i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now we found it to be a great machine for the price others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on this thing is lite strong and easy to empty the cord retractor is a little lite so i would n't be to rough with it garrett and susan	20
0	read the info about this product carefully this listing is not for kitchen scissors but rather poultry shears chef 's choice does make the 8 kitchen scissors in the picture but that is not what you will get if you order these i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon	20
0	yes watch out pls always try to read review before buying its true the picture is deceiving but what i do n't understand is why amazon keep using this picture	20
1	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you wo n't bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces	20
1	i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i'm anywhere near wine snob status i did n't want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i'm happy with them they 're sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they 're not snobby either i would have given this 5 stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they 're great	20
1	i need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price plus 6 napkins both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and i threw them straight into the washer they are 55 cotton and 45 polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free i am very happy with these basic table linens i like the price too made in pakista	20
1	the price was excellent ordering was quick and easy delivery was prompt the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle	20
0	we ordered a cherry coat rack \( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item \) and it came as light oak i tried to get it exchanged but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause it wasnt their fault i dont know whose fault it is but i ordered a cherry i got something totally different and their customer service didnt service me and wasnt customer friendly never again	20
0	i did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel they are too big and bulky to provide any comfort i guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane i would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow i would n't recommend these particular pillows	20
1	the nordic ware sunflower pan is just what i wanted it came in perfect condition and in a very timely fashion thank you	20
0	i used this item twice the second time i had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack it broke into 5 pieces ! waste of money	20
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc	20
0	the sheets say they are sateen but feel more like basic cotton or flannel since i was really going for that cotton sateen feel i'm not impressed i have a queen sized bed and have not had any problems getting the sheets to fit on the bed even after washing as some other reviews stated	20
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc	20
1	i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage \( despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer \) the unit works great !	20
0	i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here 's why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the quot stainless quot steel does in fact rust and corrode2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly	20
1	clean elegant easy to use and clean but this cutting board has an aesthetic appeal that goes beyond mere functionality clean lines thinner than most boards and the look and feel of wood without the practical \( and bacterial \) problems a joy to use	20
1	this is the nicest pie dish i 've ever seen i dont even make pies but i got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things it 's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too the color is deep and rich i got the cobalt i will find a place to display this dish it 's so pretty got one for my friend too she loves it as much as i do at 20 00 and free shipping you gotta try this ! maybe i 'll even try a pie	20
0	pretty but started rusting on the edges after first wash would not buy these again	20
1	i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working i find it easy to insert the cans it works great if you follow the directions it 's not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink it 's a good buy	20
1	these bowls have been in my home for a few years now we have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave they are nice looking and very functional when we needed another bowl when one broke we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl	20
0	bought this at target returned it the next day not even close to the quality of b d t r o 's from even a few years ago summed up in one word 'cheesy' is the appropriate descriptor	20
1	holds everything makes perfect pot roasts i use all clad mc2 for most cooking but when i need to braise i use this i love it	20
1	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up i use mine constantly and did n't think i would when i bought it we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own i love my fiestaware you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes	20
1	this krups toaster is the best i have ever used ! perfect toast every time the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife the defrost function works great if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices the crumb tray slides out easily eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster all in all the best toaster i have ever owned	20
0	first of all the item is too small it is about 1 3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1 3 as wide so as you can see it is pretty small so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again it does not make life easier good in principle but does not work	20
0	people cliam this fan is quiet it 's not quiet i wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night it 's too loud and keeps me awake	20
0	i purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old 's room he has a 19 inch tv vcr dvd combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a 20 inch tv if you have a modern tv with speakers on the side it will not fit ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the item directly from step2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item ! ! ! !	20
1	i 've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32 and this works great ! i have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor this product lets me pick the length i need it 's metal materials makes it quite durable too hooray	20
0	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it 's simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday	20
1	my three cats adore this playpen just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease they also love snuggling in the bed together \( 2 cats fit at a time \) my only complaint is that i ca n't find the replacement teases they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non catnip styles the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i ca n't find them at petco 's online store i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find	20
1	the flutes are absolutely great ! exactly what i wanted and even better than expected i will be purchasing more of these shortly	20
1	works just fine for my needs i use it to press my 'wrinkle free' dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package 'disappeared' at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups \( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing \) the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	20
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided much smaller than anticipated i can only fit a tablespoon in it	20
1	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it 's also compact i gained a little more counter space	20
1	these bowls are a perfect size for holding one portion much better than plastic containers that melt in the microwave i use one almost every day for taking my lunch to work at 2 99 it more than pays for itself every time you use it \( verses buying a take out lunch \)	20
0	i purchased this reconditioned item primarily to toast english muffins which i eat regularly strangely i had to set it all the way up to its darkest setting \( 9 \) just to get the muffin to be somewhat browned i would routinely have to toast more than once to get the desired level of toasting i suspect there was something wrong with mine but who knows \? i returned my kitchenaid and ordered a krups toaster i am hoping for better results	20
1	this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money do n't buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you 'll be glad that you did	20
0	i received this item in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 unable to use still sitting in the box unused tried to contact the 800 given by the rep to return to date no luc	20
0	first one came cracked second one came chipped gave up	20
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok	20
0	the feel of the sheet is good but the details such as the elastic are questionable elastic on fitted sheet is loose and slips off easily	20
1	my two tanks of cichlids loaches and catfish love this food gives them high energy so they 're active and interesting throughout the day also the tank appears cleaner or clearer even with multiple feedings with this product as indicated versus the regular tetramin that does cloed up the water	20
1	i purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken i could n't be happier with the product i received and i am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that i had a great buy	20
0	if you are looking for a plastic box that rotates then look no further if you are looking for a space heater keep looking	20
0	i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i was n't intending to use the delay feature very often so i did n't bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i'm shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one	20
0	very disappointed with this fan failed within six months of purchasing do n't buy a lasko fan	20
1	they worked so well we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails the mojito 's were a hit we set up a mojito education station on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video then we had a station set up with mint sugar rum lime wedes ice and soda water this muddle was an excellent purchase it did the job efficiently and well even mojito novices got the hang of it easily great buy and good luc	20
1	product arrived promptly in good condition ! this product costs twice as much at vets office somebodies making money ! ! !	20
0	my beagle \( 13 mo \) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks not smaller barking or any form of whining \( even if extremely loud \)	20

1	i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too the product is wonderful it 's being used on a daily basis i am extremely happy with the product the shipper	20
0	thank gawd i did n't purchase this product ! my landlord has it in my apartment and i have to hang dry everything because it does n't dry clothes at all ! ! sometimes it does n't even wash ! go to sears and do proper research on a washing machine !	20
0	i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it well that chance did not pay off even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it	20
0	the coffee is extremely hot from this coffeemaker beware ! i find the product adequate but not outstanding it is difficult to insert the pot all the way in after use	20
1	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans and is made from the same heavy weight metal but the result is darling would be great for tiny garnish on a larger dessert for a tea or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !	20
1	the best product ever ! i have 5 cats and let me tell you if it were n't for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago \( or i 'd just have a very stinky household ! \) have used it for a long time and will continue to do	20
1	i use this desk chair frequently as a student i spend many hours sitting and studying at my desk the chair does n't take up much space in my small apartment and it is comfortable and sturdy plus it was a great value so even if it does n't last forever i am very happy for now	20
1	this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats great product at a great price	20
0	i know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside i took out the battery and found water in the compartment i give it as many as two stars because until the water got in it did work as advertised and seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing i'm wondering if i just had a bad o ring now i'm off to find a better thermometer	20
0	the seals are not air or water tight there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window but i cannot store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove	20
0	beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews	20
0	a drawback of calphalon 's anodized alumninum is that it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher but stainless steel is dishwasher safe and amazon 's product description claims that calphalon 's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe but if you check out www calphalon com and look at the description of their stainless line it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent so it is dishwasher safe but you ca n't use dishwasher detergent	20
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it its the perfect size to make pancakes eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles college students and anyone who likes great things in small packages	20
1	my husband and i fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza a tombstone pizza fits great on this plate	20
1	ice bucket is smaller than i expected otherwise a very good product	20
0	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end also i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere !	20
1	this is a massive skillet ! be warned it 's heavy but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan it 's preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great i would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down	20
0	had this grinder for 8 months two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds i'm tossing it and getting a different brand all form no function	20

0	this was a horrible egg slicer i thought something from kitchenaid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile but was i wrong worked fine for eggs but broke on the first strawberry my previous one broke on the first mushroom ! do n't bother use a knife save the slicer for the eggs	20
1	i got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected well made with a sharp edge that holds up the only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip	20
1	great for the money feel like expensive sheet very happy with it just hope it is available with other colors	20
0	the lid drops in half the time you 're trying to put it on the first six meals or so smell bad \( spoiled \) as they are cooking i think it 's the sealing ring ! what a god awful smell for a kitchen	20

0	i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave	20
1	i have just opened the three sets and they are beautiful they arrived in perfect condition and i cannot believe how fast the delivery was a perfect addition for our dinner table	20
1	i have found this to be the best i have ever owned my daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and i just had to have a bunn also i envied my daughter 's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes i used to only have 12 cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now the best is that you can always have a fresh cup of coffee and it is always hot it makes a clean cup of coffee easily and efficiently we are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone this will be our brand of coffee maker forever	20
0	we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model	20
0	we 've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it 's ok but nothing special it does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality	20
0	i was disappointed when it arrived in pieces they didn't pack this well and i had to send it back i was impressed by the free return postage i do want this item and have requested another hopefully it will arrive in one piece this time then it might be worth more stars	20

0	i liked the blinker light when i got it in fact friends noticed it and i referred them here to get it however in short order it went on the blink so to speak the on off mechanics are not well designed and literally half the time the darn thing is such a pain to get working i either take it apart and reassemble it or throw it back in the drawer	20
1	i love the different speeds it offers i have found it to be really cleaning the dust from the room so far so goo	20
1	although it has two prongs to do two shapes at the same time i had problems with the cookies sticking together so i would recommend only using one mold at a time	20
1	these pans are made by ekco and durable the nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease	20
1	this is great ! easy set up dishwasher safe \( top shelf only \) and super quiet \( there is a very faint humm \) our cats went right over to check it out it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher 5 stars ! ! ! i 'd give it more if i could	20
1	i love this carafe it is perfect for making flavored water with sliced lemons limes oranges the narrow neck means that the fruit wo n't fall into your glass while you are pouring and the fruit staying put also means it can steep in the water longer yu	20
1	i purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines i have had no issues with the decanture being delicate infact we machine wash it after each use the only issue i have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture	20
1	this lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting the serving bowl is much larger than i anticipated and great for tossing space the individual bowls are also deep this is a great set for salad lovers	20
1	i really like these glasses they are attractive and pleasant to hold i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line	20
1	this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !	20
1	it is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels \) what you probably do n't see on the picture well it stands on plastic so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding has really easy refill no mess no fuss and you can always see when you need to buy pepper i do n't think there is better pepper grinder out there others i saw are certainly better looking artsy whatever but this one is the most useful !	20
1	i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i'm sure money well spent	20

1	excellent item very powerful and stylish would recommend this mixer to anyone that likes to bake and has trouble with power from hand held mixers	20
0	corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo	20
0	i received my bowls today and was very disappointed how bowls this size can be referred to as mixing bowls i cannot fathom neither do i know what could be mixed in bowls so small the second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl the bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the cereal bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl the smallest bowl is a joke i doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over the material is nice melamine and colorful but those are the only positive statements i can make	20
1	this was a gift to my wife for valentine 's day a good friend of hers had one and after she tried it that 's all she wrote ! we have been extremely pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing one	20
0	while the water tasted better this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place	20
0	i only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on \( not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on \) caused the inner lid seal to break the lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced now i have to deal with seeing if amazon will help me replace the unit even though i already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago i would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein	20
0	i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet so now you do n't have filtered water my husband replaced washer and it still dripped if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined	20
1	this is a good pet bed and a bargain for the prize seems to be well made very puffy my dog was trying to pound it down before laying on it i love the round shape have always had rectangles but this fits the area better and seems to provide plenty of laying room for the dog	20
0	way off target said 350 degrees when in reality it was almost 500 doesnt work	20
0	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
1	when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b c the materials are light weight but i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic it was just so easy and looked so good ! i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer unlike other reviewers i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts	20
0	hi really like drinking wine from these glasses ended up with 8 each in two sizes broke my 4th glass the other day while cleaning it never broke any other end high stemware doing that believe me i 've been very careful too also had one break in a very modern dishwasher operating on a crystal cycle just too thin and fragile despite the resonable price and good functionalit	20
0	the heater works fine but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period i will not buy an oil filled heater again	20

0	this came broken the packaging was not good damage good do n't make happy custome	20
0	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after this one did n't even work out of the box there was no mist just air oh well i figured i was taking my chances anyway if you buy this hopefully you have better luck update nowadays most grocery stores sell pre packaged pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time	20
0	the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i'm almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though	20
0	the slipcover barely covered my sofa will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside it keeps sliding off where i have to adjust it several times during the day if i could i would get my money back	20
0	i 've owned one of these for about a month it 's a total waste of money it rarely sprays just a steady stream of oil i'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads etc i am so very disappointed i 'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it 's advertised	20
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too i replaced the beams but they stop working days later it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium \( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks \)	20
1	we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone i built a knife holder to use in a drawer now with the wusthof 25 slot i have removed my home made holder the drawer can be used to store other items i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years there is no need to buy a lot of new knives just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use you ca n't go wrong with this super storage block	20
0	i'm really upset with this item i registered for it and when i got it the thing did n't work i called the 800 number trying to see if i did everything right but could n't get a live person on the phone i went and exchange the item and the second one did n't work horrible horrible product and business	20

0	we ordered an 8 inch quiche pan when it arrived the nordic 8 inch pan turned out to be 9 inches a 9 inch quiche pan can be bought at any local store i went on line to find a hard to locate item and when i ordered this item it was not in stock so i waited almost a month for delivery and it is not as described i was deceived by the web advertisement unfortunately amazon hides the merchants name in the billing arrangement so i cannot review the merchant	20
0	we bought the scale for starting weight watchers but it does not do weights in fractions i e 1 4 lb etc also it was not as pictured the look of the scale \( in the photo \) was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring average thought its just an average scale and nothing more	20
1	love it ! fluffy warm and light perfect for snuggling up into on those cold blustery days or for building a make shift fort \) big enough to comfortably cover \( and keep warm \) many people and it 's wonderfully light so it does n't bog you down while you sleep wonderful	20

0	i can put up with the weight the noise the poorly located on off switch the spinning brush that is cool but does n't work what i cannot put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on it will appear to be on correctly but if not the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister buy something else i ca n't wait for this one to die	20
1	not fancy but it does the basic jobs well minor concern better at baking than toasting toasting takes a little too long and is not totally uniform but for the price this machine ca n't be beat	20
1	yep i had some 20 year old revere ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem and the lid from the pan fit the steamer it 's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes and probably more exactly what i needed and the price was good too	20
1	my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality	20
0	my holmes humidifer was broken \( no mist \) after 3 months i did send it with a check of 7 more than 2 months ago and have n't receive information from holmes i emailed to ask my case and they tried to fool around i am desperate ! very bad product and bad service ! i never buy holmes product again	20

0	it makes great tea but the pitchers last about 4 to 6 months before the seam on the front cracks and starts to leak it would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available then i would give it 5 stars	20
0	after a couple months the humidity became stuck at 20 even holding it by my humidifier did n't help	20
1	this fan is incredibly powerful it can definitely move air around a room my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium i do n't know if it 's just mine that is that way or not and it is n't a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i 'll tell ya when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse	20
0	i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product would n't even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you 're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen	20
1	my husband was skeptical why do you need a new 200 pot he said well i bought the dutch oven with two days of receiving it i made the best beef stew he has ever had he said the meat was much more tender than when i make the stew in a crock pot never again will he question me when i say i need a kitchen tool	20

1	i received this set packed very well no scratches no broken pieces so i have no complaints the color is beautiful and the dishes are durable	20
1	this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden 's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog 's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan	20
0	i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around i promptly called amazon and they replaced it it was a waste of money the first time i washed them white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out i was very very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again do n't waste your money	20
0	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr electronics geek light sleeper it became a pretty big joke \( and embarassment for me \) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n' spell do n't bother buy the sound screens used in medical offices etc for half the price they 're so much better	20
0	with an old coffee can true it does n't have the odor free aspect but if you are scooping a litter box there is going to be odor i just keep the can by the box and dump it in the trash when full same deal	20
1	i searched for a long time before i purchased this product and have not regretted my decision to buy like all ice crushers it is a little noisy	20
1	once you cure it \( instructions included \) this wok is as stick free as teflon but not as toxic the handle stays cool and it fits nicely on the burner with its flat bottom it 's a well made piece of cookware	20

1	these are my favorite cookers so much so i bought this one for my friend	20
1	i bought this for my husband 's birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that do n't keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee	20
1	nice compact size can be moved easily does freshen the air in the room noticeably on whisper setting is almost silent on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life maybe would sleeping does shoot out air but does not blow with any force over time like a day all the air in our 20'x20' living area changes did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off have n't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks but it would be easy to clean	20
0	after just 7 months so be aware that you might buy into some hassle by exchanging the knifes with henckels i am very dissappointed and will not spend that much money \( 80 \) on knifes ever again at least not on henckels my k mart knifes hold up better	20
0	i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we 'll have to live with the damage it 's a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time	20
0	still can't figure out what this scissor cuts it surely is not poultry or meat or fish i will have to try it on paper but then i didn't need another paper scissor ! ! ! ! !	20
1	i have made 3 batches with it and everyone has come out perfect just add the mix water and a packet of brewers yeast and even a small packet of baking yeast will work its easy no mess and you dont need to add any sugar unlike its lower priced ugly cousin mr beer the only recomenation i have is when you pour half of it with water then add the mix stir it untill almost disolved then add more water make sure its alittle warmer then room tempature alot of it will disolve then add the yeast and wait about 5 days then put it in the fridge for 10 and it will be perfect	20
1	these are simply beautiful glasses they are every bit as elegant as reidel but cost much less the glass is thin the shape is elegant they hold up well in washing i recommend them	20
0	i'm terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute does n't hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself	20
1	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning we 've experienced neither of these make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great highly recommended	20
1	this jewelry organizer is very handy and takes up no room in my closet it makes it so easy to accessorize in the mornings i'm really glad i bought it no more misplaced earrings	20
0	the product description for this is wrong ! ! there is a somewhat hidden zipper but for some inexplicable reason the lining is sewn into the cover so you ca n't separate the two	20

0	we ordered one of these racks and it was ok then we ordered another one and one of the pieces was bent making it impossible to contruct target replaced it and the replacement was similarly defective not worth the hassle of going back and forth to the post office	20
0	this has been a nightmare when i received the chair i could n't wait to put it together however the holes for the screws were too big and therefore i was unable to secure the pieces i called and asked if the the right size screws could be sent i was told that there were no provisions for that but they would be happy to send me another one \( i could return the faulty one in that box \) very nice i thought well i got the second one the screws are too small for the holes ! now i am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on ! i do n't recommend this item	20
0	we made two batches of iced tea in our maker we couldn't figure out why it was leaking but figured most of them do have spout problems my husband found a crack from the spout upward so out it went although the instructions say to adjust the spout we never touched it	20
0	not what i expected i thought it did duo patterns of rosettes but only does one i ca n't not use other rosette patterns with the set it does n't remain the heat so it took longer to make the cookies	20
0	i would rate this zero but that option is not available the weight of the stainless steel is heavy exactly what i had expected for 18 8 however the top does not affix to the base it seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base furthermore the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base that 's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter yuck ! i do not recommend the purchase of this product	20
0	this is a cute vacuum and that 's about it the filter clogs and they are next to impossible to find the canister is a pain to empty the biggest problem i found was there was no height adjustment if you have thick carpet you just need to forget about this vacuum what a nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing mine has gone to goodwill	20
1	this product is very well constructed it is simple to use and easy to clean i use it to cook brown rice and dry beans and it has cut my cooking time down immeasurably i have only had it a few months so far and i have not been able to perfect the rice \( there always seems to be too much water left at the end \) but i will keep reducing the amount of water until i have the perfect mix i would highly recommend this pressure cooker to anyone beginning cooks or seasoned culinary experts i 'll certainly be sending one down to south carolina for mothers day	20
1	excellant co to deal with we had a few questions and they were answered immediately and there was a mailing problem and this co did everything correct and fast we highly reccommend this co	20
1	great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice ! ! ! you have to spray the pan really really well with cookingspray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow thecornbread to come out in one piece i run a little spatulaaround the edges before i dump the pan gave one as a giftat christmas and it was a hit ! ! !	20
1	the step stool a gift for my daughter works well as a step stool the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together	20
0	the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove	20
1	glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter point to reidel anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable	20
0	hopefully i will never make this kind of mistake	20
0	this tea cattle is absolutely adorable it is not practical for daily use the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove the lid does n't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move	20

0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	20
0	i 've ordered three two were broken as were two replacements they sent fragile plastic breaks and ca n't support the weight of the drawers and spices they were really nice about sending replacements and refunds though	20

0	i ordered this product 3 months back as they say got into the line this item was part of an larger order so i could have gotten free shipping now i get an email from amazon stating this item has been cancelled as it was further delayed and as i did not respond to thier email for extending the wait time i never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered if i need one then i will end up paying shipping too amazon is normally good about these things how can they still have it listed on the site when they are cancelling orders in the pipeline	20

0	read the fine \( or missing \) print carefully this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets \( another 100 \) if you want to return this item they charge a restocking fee of 10 and also deduct for the shipment \( even if you got free shipping \) and you pay to ship the thing back we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores which is where the miele came from	20
0	i bought these candles in the store when i got home i set everything up and lit the candles in less that 30 minutes all 5 candles had burned to half way and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too the entire thing was on fire \( a big fire \) i was able to blow it out and take it outside to the trash can i have bought target candles before and love them i am not happy ! !	20

0	this looks like a good idea from westinghouse but if you read the warranty details the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10 year warranty 10 00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years but not really \? what is the point \? extra tape is n't even included when the first strip fails i suggest you use a flashlight	20
1	we have some pretty nasty water from the tap but this pur filter system makes it taste so good i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once the hand held ones i 've used hold about 3 i do n't know how pure the water is but it sure tastes great	20
1	this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it 's durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 ! a great deal	20
0	i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment ! ! they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on ! the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two do n't spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \? \)	20
1	this knife has made me eat more vegetables just because it 's so much fun to chop carrots i was a little concerned with the handle at first but it 's very comfortable and is n't slick at all even in soapy water i also worried that maybe i should have gotten the bigger version of this knife again my fears were unfounded as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation you ca n't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job but if you 've ever had that feeling you already know how you 'll feel using a global when i slice carrots for snacks they come out as perfect translucent discs any vegetable i 've cut has been a joy	20

0	i really like the look of the toaster and it does a nice job on one side the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other will be trying to get it repaired or likely will have to get a new one	20

0	before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i 've tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud do n't waste your mone	20

0	how does it create space \? if you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide and put this large plastic item inside it will that give you more space or take it away \? the manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you do n't need	20

0	while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking i was after the pourer that came with a flapper at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless	20
0	the way this steamer was advertised i really thought it gave out alot of steam and lasted a decent amount of time i tried it a few times and was very disappointed i returned the item	20
1	still allows some dust deposits live in az and do n't have water softener need to change more often than recommended	20
1	let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25 year old woman who is n't really big on doing chores i got a dyson for christmas and just tried out the dusting brush last week my immediate reaction was this is genius ! it is great for dusting computers televisions lampshades bookcases \( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices so normal dusting never seemed to help \) the tops of books cd organizers ceiling fan blades metal bedframes i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment and it works beautifully this attachment will not disappoint trust me it 's already made my life so much easier and cleaner	20

1	this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least	20

0	i ca n't believe i spent good money on this vacuum i 've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems why it wo n't vacuum without pushing it with all my might why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children why the filter wo n't stay in place and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it i have replaced every filter and belt now i am going to throw it away i 'd gladly give it to charity but i ca n't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim	20

1	let 's face it you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated nice furniture and practical book shelves but you do not live alone there is probably a canine or feline lurking around it may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of garfield on it or some cutesy saying but in the long run this durable multi use dishwasher safe bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he she wants a few laps of water	20
0	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it 's useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last	20
1	i have found this to be a very good product and easy to use i would give it a 5 star rating if all the removable parts could be washed in a dishwasher i can't see why they could not be	20
1	our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs	20
1	the plates are modern and good looking always rate compliments from guestts i would like them more if they were a little bigger	20

0	i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it rather than 2 however i used it exactly 5 days and then it died granted the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it but i really expected it to last more than 5 days unfortunately it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed so i was forced to throw it away lesson learned some things are just not a bargain ! !	20
1	i have used this vacuum only on carpet as i bought it for my finished basement suction is very powerful it is quiet and the dirt cup is so easy to empty the cup is designed so that you push a lever and it empties from the bottom very clever and so easy and clean it is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot other nice features include a very long cord and great looks ! the most important thing is suction and this baby is powerful ! ! it 's amazing what this thing picks up overall extremely pleased with this vacuum !	20

1	i ordered this four piece set and really like it the quality seems great and durable the color is defitely not white it is more of a light tan color but the price was too good compared to other sets i 've seen at pier 1 ect so i wo n't be retuning it just want you all to know it 's not white but very sturdy	20
1	when i was looking to purchase a new machine i only was looking for a bunn bunn makes the best coffee machines none can compare every diner coffee house and dunkin' donuts only use bunn machines the a10 is one great machine ! brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly everyone in my office is very happy with the unit if you 're a serious coffee drinker please do n't cheap out on a mr coffee braun or krupps frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed temperature or taste of a bunn unit i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch	20
0	this is the most poorly designed machine i have ever seen it is continually clogging both filters and the hepa filter becomes filled with dirt quickly causing loss of all suction i replaced it with the dyson dc17 which is awesome do not buy this vacuum	20
0	i was very disappointed with this cheese slicer the wire broke after about the fourth use i have always had good experiences with oxo and was very surprised	20
1	this is a fine dehyrator it 's quick and powerful the description says the trays are 13 5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the fd 50 60 this model \( fd 1010 \) has 15 25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13 5 inch tray multiply those larger trays by 30 \( the maximum capacity \) and you got a huge amount of drying surface	20
1	this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i had n't foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it	20
1	my boss wanted extra seating in my office for visitors we ordered online but were a little worried this loveseat was delivered very quickly assembled in minutes and is so comfortable that my boss has decided to keep it in his office ! now i have to wait for another one good thing it only takes a few days	20

1	extremely delighted with this product not only does it perform flawlessly it 's beautiful to look at combine that with the best price anywhere thanks to amazon and target and you have perfection ! thanks	20
1	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set	20
1	just purchased my airwasher humidifier and so far am pleased with the ease of maintenance i felt compelled to write a review and let other consumers know that the required water treatment additive is available from the manufacturer website with no shipping and handling charges www venta airwasher co	20
1	i like this winged corkscrew but i had to repair the plastic once when the cap near the wings busted off superglue did the job and i have n't had trouble since	20
0	this product does work and produces great tasting water for a while i thought maybe we 'd done something to make it leak but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time \( approx 8 months \) there 's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks and then eventually squirts water all over the place there is no way to fix it we wo n't be buying this brand again	20
0	works good except for with the cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly but makes great coffee	20
0	we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift we 've tried cooking rice in it three times and all three times the rice has burned it simply gets too hot like some of the other reviewers we added more and more water but it did n't help the cooker finally does kick into warm mode but by then it 's too late we were thrilled when we realized it was non stick but what good is non stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible	20
1	this could well be the perfect dog toy especially if your dog is a queensland heeler with a knack for destroying plastic frisbees tennis balls etc in seconds flat i 've had one for a couple of weeks now and aside from some dirt spots it looks new it is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not so tender mercies of my dog 's attention this disc is not only very durable it actually flies really well as something of a flying disc connoisseur i ca n't help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries plus it floats perfect !	20
1	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef 's knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	20
0	many times i 've come across great deals on amazon where i 've paid just little for a lot this is not one of those moments this pan feels like it 's made from three layers of tin foil it 's shockingly flimsy	20
1	there is n't a lot to say about this other than this pan demonstrates the kitchenaid high quality that one would expect from kitchenaid it 's extremely well made and of very high quality	20
1	this is a high quality pan with a nice heavy weight to it not at all flimsy i wanted to get one like my mom 's and this turned out to be less expensive but a much better quality and heavier weight i bought 2 of these along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon 's 4 for 3 promotion and it only came to about 30 ! that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality i would absolutely recommend these	20
1	we received the zephyr as a wedding gift ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo the handle on ours is brass instead of chrome it heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup o noodle much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there my wife and i are very pleased with this tea kettle	20

0	i was pleased with the way the hoover cleaned my floors except that i had to empty the containers too many times after using it for 3 or 4 weeks i realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible i hope i can return it because i can no longer use it terry sit	20
1	i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish ! looks great on my table \( along with my red salt and papper shakers	20
1	the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material	20
0	this canister vac might be ok for very light duty but do n't expect it to handle any real housecleaning the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot if i had it to do over again i would not purchase this vac i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum	20

1	i got my grill to go advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far the makers of the grill 2 go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill the open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models it is still easy to transport and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my tarheels play basketball a lot of fun i completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non stick cooking surface for the cooking area	21
0	i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii	21
1	bought this for my wife she loves it perfect for a first time bounty hunters it works very well for anyone that does n't need all the professional features	21
0	even at a cheap price its not worth it spend a few more and get a better machin	21

1	shopped a long time for this one wanted more pit than the copper bowls had to offer plus came with grill cover and handy fire tool nice deal easy to assemble	21
1	this is a wonderful dutch oven i hemed and hawed between the more pricey lodge logic \( which my other cast iron pans are \) and this bayou classis thrift won out and i bought this one i am not disappointed in any way it was easy to season and makes an unbeatable pot roast	21
1	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
0	i bought this clock expecting it to show the humidity in a room show the temperature and to set itself for daylight savings it does neither of the above the temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always way off in the same room i have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately the clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok but it should do more i am very disappointed	21
1	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21
1	i got this feeder for my husband for christmas last year and recently purchased another as a house gift it is lovely even when not filled and is sturdy even though it looks delicate we have had several storms with hard wind and rain and had no problems the glass globes are easy to fill and clean it has not attracted many hummingbirds but as many as the nearby red flowers we did not notice any bees until late october and then only a few	21
1	i bought this as a complete novice to the sport \? \? of metal detecting i bought it with the intention of locating a few property stakes and maybe finding some valuable treasures in my yard to date i have found neither i would chalk this up to my inexperiece and to the fact that i have not gotten out and used it nearly as much as i imagined i would everything i have read about this particular detector indicated it was an introductory model that works reasonably well i would agree	21
1	you know beagles love chewing my new beagle who came from a shelter loves to chew i mean he loves chewing anything he sees ! ! ! since my husband and i work fulltime and we have to leave him in a crate all day every morning i stuff low sodium peanut butter and dog treat and he loves it lick and chew all day ! and even after all day chewing the kong does n't break at all i also like the kong bounds and rolls everywhere because of the funny shape and he loves to chase this is the best dog toy i 've ever got	21
1	i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm this one 's lots better ! the projection feature works ok though does n't really focus sharply at the close distances i 'd prefer to use the eight minute snooze alarm is great just the right interval ! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock	21
1	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
0	aside from the nifty weather prediction this clock is completely impractical the projection numbers are about 1 2 inch tall with minimal clarity the clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible i am surprise this is sold on amazon thank goodness for amazon 's customer friendly returning policy i think amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good	21
0	my driveway patrol worked okay for a few days then stopped sensing cars as they drove past does anyone know what i can do to get it working again	21

1	an amazing little grill with 8 charcoal briquettes i cooked a couple of salmon burgers on it for lunch then put on two cornish game hens put on the cover let them bake for an hour and had them later for dinner note don't peak under the lid when using this grill as an oven the heat escapes and it takes awhile to build it back up instead use your nose ears an excellent little grill for camping picnics and emergencies since it uses so little fuel you can do a great deal of cooking with a single bag of charcoal do n't use lighter fluid use a small starter stick to start the coals	21
1	this is a great umbrella the quality is excellent for the price and it arrived timely and packaged well the color is not a bright yellow but more of a maize yellow but coordinates well with my brightly striped chair cushions ! i think the more muted color will help keep it looking nice longer i think a brighter yellow would fade and or look discolored sooner	21
1	this is our first fire pit and it seems to work great it is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice the only downside and i think this is true of all firepits is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there i find myself cleaning the bowl more often than i 'd like but otherwise is a great	21
1	this is the greatest cleaning system i 've seen it 's sturdy and i can reach to the top of my cathedral ceilings easily the ceiling fan attachement is great a couple of swipes with this attachement and it 's clean no more standing on a step ladder trying to reach the fan blades	21

0	they were on sale and i ordered 2 they arrived separately in two huge boxes via ups and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up sigh the mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing i guess they got beaten up in transit the actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense so i kept them they are outside and hopefully they wo n't fall apart too quickly if you are really picky you better take a good look at these when they are delivered	21

1	this was such a hit at christmas for my son great gift idea and fast shippin	21
0	as was the case with the previous reviewer i did not receive the item that was described it is not a professional outdoor cooker but a commercial grade cooker in addition there are no baskets included this set up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment what you 'll get is what is shown in the picture not what is described	21
0	i used another version of this device in college and found that it worked well this product has not even phased the roaches in my house and to add insult to injury it makes an annoying ticking sound like a clock in every room of my house	21
0	i purchased two cushions to use on small chairs when the cushions i arrived i could hardly believe how small they were smaller than the description stated in addition to the small size the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions	21
1	the bench is easy to assemble and lid actuallydoes work well it is not an item that will lastforever but it is priced fairly for what it is a storagebench	21
1	this is great furniture folks many times i have thought that amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but i cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is ! i bought 4 chairs the settee and b c they do n't have a side table in the bainbridge pattern i bought the shaw table with the ice pit i have recommended these to everyone lol the price has gone up 10 every week for the past 2 weeks get em while their hot	21
1	i was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when i sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what i needed and wanted to cancel the order he very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and i was impressed with this service gayla tregr	21
1	we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too the original one was bought w the 22 wok which is gorgeous we use both w woks and it 's kewl easy to break down for travel too only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available ca n't seem to get one now	21
1	fun gift that works great ! ! ! ! after receiving one to give i ordered one for myself	21
1	these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella very low tech and smart my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for they are totally stationary and do n't have a tilting feature that might be standard i just do n't know but i would have wanted that flexibility oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible and they 're simple to put together and take apart great price and they block the sun and look terrific	21
1	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
1	i got this to go with my new silver b weber and i had the best chicken and ribs that i 've had in a very very long time it is extremely simple to assemble operate and most importantly to clean i 've had two different rotisserie ovens that i dreaded to use based on the cleaning factor alone cleaning this is quick and easy the small parts get clean by simply placing in hot soapy water in the sink i plan on using this a lot	21
0	even after thorough cleaning leaves a terrible metal taste to the food i must 've washed this 5 or 6 times in my attempt to remove the metal odor i also noticed some rust colored powder on parts of the surface after washing yuck	21
1	i recently moved into a house and was seeing spiders and centipedes on a regular basis so i decided to buy these to see if i could get rid of them i 've been using these for about 3 weeks in various rooms of the house and have n't seen a bug since i have to say that they really seem to be doing what they 're supposed to i have used similar products like this in the past \( not from black and decker \) and have also found them to work so i believe that this technology actually works well for getting rid of pests	21
1	i 've used this along with the base station for one year now i 've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine	21
1	my wife and kids love the chair but i do n't care for it that much i thought the chair was a little bit constricting assembly was easy give yourself alot of room for it the base is huge	21
1	the description does n't do this rib rack justice this thing is pretty big and will hold a lot of chicken you will certainly not complain about running out of room ! even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood there 's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8 washing it may be a problem just wash it immediately after using it	21
1	i have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control there are simply too many open seams to allow in air so it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years \( though eventually the firebox will burn out \)	21
0	this is a beautiful piece of b b q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and i'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times ! looking back at the original information it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects i wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect i will let you know what happens too bad about the brush it looked so good with my stainless steel weber	21
0	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
1	i purchased this to monitor my attic and crawl space temperature prior to installation of additional attic ventilation vents and insulation 3 channel readings are accurate to within 0 5 deg f sometimes we lose the signal but it reacquires it relatively easily min max temperature memory is a nice feature	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
1	guys this is a great purchase it 's a quality unit and is bigger than it looks on the package charbroil has done a fabulous job of making such a good little unit for such a good price unless you 're looking for something totally snazzy and are willing to spend a lot of money do n't pass this one up	21
1	we love our water hammocks they are so easy to fold up and carry down to the beach and then so easy to inflate and deflate they are comfortable	21
1	i'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the baby q griddle cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster \( too fast at first \) the lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy it got to the point where i had to remove the bacon remove the griddle dump the grease and continue cooking on the plus side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless	21
0	this item was a disapointment looks great in the picture but is cheaply made peices of the wicker were coming loose the item is also very short i am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches i guess you get what you pay for if you spend 800 1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this	21
1	if you are the type that wakes up during the night and has to know the time this is the clock for you i absolutely love it no glasses necessary and i do n't have to crane my neck to find the time if you 're a fanatic about exact time \( i'm not \) the atomic feature means you 're always on schedule i like this clock so much that i will be purchasing several as extra christmas gifts its a great fun item too	21
0	there oughta be a law i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
0	i have had this smoker since august and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better	21
1	i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product we are totally pleased with what we received the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	21
1	i am very pleased with the hose hanger big and sturdy plus it does not look cheap my only problem is that one of the leaves broke off already but for the price it 's a really good buy	21
0	i do n't own this clock but i do own one of it 's sister clocks the tambour style mantel clock and it did not change for dst now that the date has changed even though i 've owned my clock for all of a month and a half river city cuckoo clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect since i would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics i would be very wary about buying this clock	21
1	not a bad product quite sturdy for being made of plastic and all the pieces simply snapping together don't assemble it if the pieces are cold i shattered two pieces trying after the shipping box was in single digit weather overnight let it warm up first ! grinny from m	21
1	i got my husband this hammock for father 's day and he loves it no complaints whatsoever	21
0	very poor construction to the point where i had to return it to the manufacturer pre assembled bench seat had been over tightened so that metal screws were portruding through wood into seating area aesthetically unappealing because of the diverse colors of the wood definately would not reccomend this product	21
0	do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill ! there were warnings with this product saying that it should n't be left outside but i figured it could n't be that bad a couple months later i discovered that my cutting board \( left on a covered porch through a mild california winter \) had completely split into several pieces for a 30 outdoor product this is really unacceptable a plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	21
1	this cushion is extra long and extra thick and should work with most any chaise lounge it has really firm support not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season i highly recommend it	21
0	i have had the unit for about 3yrs rain guage was repaired once did n't work one more year just had a storm with 50 mile an hour winds i watched the wind guage it showed 18 miles an hour need i say more !	21
1	we purchased this grill to take with us when we go camping it is small and does not take up too much room however you can fit a lot of food on it this is a great weber product	21
0	a major concept of an atomic clock to me meant i would not have to reset it for dst other clocks in my home took care of it i waited two weeks and this clock did not i ca n't trust if for the true time so i am sorry i purchased it	21
1	you ca n't go wrong buying this great grill it was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions it heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency no cold spots as far as i can tell so far on any parts of the cooking surface and flame ups are kept to a minimum you wo n't be dissapointed if you bring this baby home	21
1	cover fit easily over grill no problems plus it was cheaper than name brand	21
1	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	i am a southern guy from ga and have been using outside cookers all of my adult life this one is a winner you ca n't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy using an outside cooker with the various size cooking pots you can cook for 2 or 20 very simple to set up and use i really like this one and the price was a bargin	21
0	i keep an indoor garden and i need accurate readings it is of poor quality and unreliable do n't buy this	21
1	we have really high ceilings this works great ! and for under 30 you just cant beat it !	21
1	really goes good in my room i really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings	21
1	this pizza cooker works really well i have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time a couple of hints for using the cooker turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan	21
1	i had used a friend 's hammock chair before buying my own but his was made of very thin synthetic threads that catch quite easily on buttons etc not so with the charleston ! the cotton rope that makes up the weave is very comfortable to sit in all on its own or with the chair cushion that is provided and if it happens to catch on something it 's no big deal all i have to monitor with the kids is how far they swing i love it my wife loves it my kids love it ca n't wait to take it camping this summer \( though i may never leave the chair someone else has fire duty from now on \)	21
1	first experience with this brand very well made elegant i actually had my first compliment ever what a good looking bar b q cover if it holds up well during our 100 summer desert heat i 'll definately choose this brand again along with the great amazon service	21
1	needs to be near a window to get the time signal	21
1	a fully cooked fall apart pork butt in less that 2 hours you 'll think you died and went to heaven easy assembly easy clean up put a whole chicken on and you will never fry chicken again ever	21
1	the cover is exactly what i needed to protect our smoker from the weather it is strong and appears to be durable i felt that the price was fair for this product	21
0	very nice alarm clock easy to set up but huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button very inconvenient ! ! ! !	21
1	the umbrella i ordered is fine just what i had hoped it would be however i subsequently ordered an umbrella stand \( after you prompted me to do so \) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off as a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin i have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store any suggestions	21
1	i was impressed looking at this grill at home depot and was even more impressed at the price on amazon com in using the grill i discovered that the weber is truly better than what i have been used to in the past the food actually tastes better ! the assembly took a little longer than the 30 minutes given in the instruction sheet i had a little difficulty in interpreting the pictures and i feel that some written instructions would have been beneficial	21
1	we were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it but we are really glad we decided to buy it ! so far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around ! and believe me we live in a mountainy area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage i have not seen them ever since we bought this product it is working for us	21
1	the person that i gave this gift to really enjoys and finds it easy to use	21
0	the material and construction are good i purchased this because the ad said it would fit a 9' tree the bag is 6' long	21
1	this is a good product i'm very happy with the atachments the squgee works real well its hard to find a good one with treads to screw onto a extention pole the pole should extend to 15 feet its only 10 feet long fully extended but nice and short to carry around in and out of viechels i would order this product just for the attachment	21
1	down here in southern mississippi you can sit inside with the ac in summer or hang a hammock in the shade but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it 's so lightweight i prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it 's so durable i 've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat the grandbaby loves it	21
1	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
1	this outdoor bird cage is ideal in the winter because it has a strong wire mesh that prohibits piles of snow or manure to fall into the living area of the bird works well with mostly smaller birds plenty of room for seeds and water even a furry friend or two can also substitute for a squirrel cage or a mini buddhist temple for midgets	21
1	i have been using a grill mat for 4 months and i love it i grill fish and chicken on a broilmaster grill and i have only great things to say about the mat i spray a bit of olive oil on after it is warm and then grill my food and it is great ! !	21
1	i always recommend the oxo line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use this is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis arthritis or carpal tunnel these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils try them out	21
1	fast delievery great price and quality we will enjoy it many years to come	21
1	i gave the grill to my son and his wife as a housewarming present i think they 've cooked out every weekend since they love it	21
1	i just received this table cover and am very pleased this is a high quality product the material is heavy and lined with waterproof rubber and the construction is superior with double sewn seams and heavy duty hand grips a much better product than i have seen for similar prices in local stores	21
1	this tiny alarm clock is really cool you have to read the manual and adjust how big and bright you want the projection on the ceiling you can also adjust how loud and different patterns you want the alarm sound it tells the temperature also i liked it so much i bought my mom one	21
1	i have had an oregon scientific clock for the last 7 years finally had to replace it because of a soda spill i knew i wanted another oregon scientific clock and this was the best choice in fact this one works better then the old one \( no long cord with a humongous antenna \) i love the time on the ceiling feature yes it only works when no sunlight is in the room but i dont sleep during the day i highly recomend this product	21
1	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	i received one with my la crosse weather station and placed it on the east side of my dwelling it provides a true reading unlike others i 've used in the past i plan on adding 1 or 2 more sensors for an even better reading	21
1	this grill works great everytime ! the only problem i have is with the lighter but it is not a big deal easy to use and always give a great grilling experiences	21
1	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
1	great cover heavy and well made fit 's perfect it did n't come with any bourbon or beer though i was dissappointed	21
1	very stylish looking chaise no assembly required not unlike crate and barrel atrium but at a fraction of the price and maybe not as sturdy made of fixed but flexible metal slats like ikea wood slatted base matresses cushions are needed to use this piece of furniture i was hopping not always i bought also a couple of deep seating chairs \( read review \) the deep seating sofa 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables	21
1	if you buy all three of these items individually from amazon com they cost 11 50 less than buying them in this set ! other than that i highly recomend these i grill several times a week and these have been put to good use with no complaints	21
1	i recently purchased a weber gold series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill i decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the weber name and i was not disappointed the spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort the length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish i would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their weber grill !	21
1	received after a weeks time per amazon this was supposed to be in stock and shipped immediately clock is working good there is no instruction maunal in the packag	21
1	keeps the ribs from searing lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	21
1	bought it and deep fried a turkey very juicy even after rewarming in the microwave the next day i did end up ripping the hose out of the end of this thing though i pulled it gently when moving it and it came right out oops	21
1	this is my second bug zapper took another brand back that did n't work this zapper is working great and that 's all thanks to its intelligent design some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs this zapper works really well in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we 'd always have bugs coming in the back door now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor great product	21
0	i currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds i love the way this one looks but the birds do n't feed from it and i'm not sure why the other one will be empty and they still do n't come to this one	21
0	i purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now i am shopping for a different brand it worked fine for the first summer season in texas but now that it is spring almost summer it does not turn on at all i have completed all of the manual 's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it but it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage ! i do not recommend ! !	21
1	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
0	i bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month one night i saw a mouse running across my stove so i brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop later that evening i was washing dishes and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of shake'n'bake right past the rodent repellant five times ! !	21
1	purchased for the weber genesis silver a it is a genuine weber replacement part fits and operates perfectly easy installation and cheaper than buying from weber directly	21
1	i bought this to monitor the evening outdoor temperature when it finally cools off enough outside i turn the air conditioner off and run just the fan on fresh air this was simple to set up and seems to work flawlessly i like that a change in temperature registers very quickly in tenths of a degree	21
1	pop a battery in and forget it it sets itself and was right on the dot even after daylight savings time came in	21
1	very simple to install if you need a new starter however after installing a new starter new burner tubes and new flavorizer bars \( all easy \) i discovered that something was wrong with one of the valves in my manifold i recommend this kit highly if you need a new starter but make sure you actually need one first turn the gas on and spray windex \( easier than soapy water \) over everything that might be leaking	21
1	this pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels the squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes i would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound i ca n't hear this noise in the attic so i will buy another when this wears out	21
1	this upgrade is worth every penny i agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even i would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner there is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better	21
1	larger than i expected and thick heavy good quality and definately worth the price	21
1	we have a brinkmann 810 7080 7 gourmet electric smoker grill and when using it the first time we were really impressed with the end product pork spareribs we put a dry rub on the ribs including 1 mccormick grill mates mesquite2 garlic salt3 onion salt4 lemon pepperwe put blocks of hickery wood around the electric coil in the bottom of the smoker we are not sure if the ribs had either a mesquite or hickkery smoke flavor but they were outstanding	21
0	the repeller works fine at repelling but when on the rodent setting it makes an audible chirping noise that 's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people do n't normally go the reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed but the manual says that it 'll only run two or three days on battery power making it absolutely worthless for this use	21
0	my husband was so excited when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up he is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right only to have issues withthe wind barameter we have tried to trouble shoot with the online andhandwritten manuals unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box sooooo needless to say theexcitement is gone	21
0	as a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the sw i can say that red or any other color dye is nonsense ! not needed quite likely harmful also i question the instant nectar instructions say it does n't require boiling is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth \? if so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers it could harm their natural internal flora	21
1	this is a quality heavy duty grill cover when you pay good money for a weber grill you want it to stay looking good do n't go buy one of those cheap walmart covers for 10 it will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two this cover wasnt cheap but by the looks of it it should last a long time	21
1	these lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that i have found they are extremely comfortable sturdy and attractive ! plus free shipping and they come already assembled which is a big deal for me since i am not very handy ! ! great item and great deal all around	21
0	the product is virtually worthless after making all possible adjustments the devise is totally unreliable i would really like to get my money back because the thing is already in the garbage	21
1	does it have radium so that we can see time in dark during night without turning light on	21
1	as far as the variety of hummingbird feeders go this is in a category all its own you got your basic plastic molded crappy looking feeders your glass bouble oddly resembling a hanging easter egg type feeders then this lovely mobile which even empty in winter makes a lovely display	21
0	very disappointed with this item only two of the eight lights work and they only stay on for about an hour there 's plenty of sunshine here in new mexico to charge them up but they still do n't work and are just plain worthless	21
1	worth more than the price tag beautiful and elegant you will be very pleased	21
1	i cannot wait to have a party i purchased both this and the fire pit table both pieces are easy to assemble sturdy and really fun ! my sister is going to be so jealous what are sisters for	21
1	america 's test kitchen rated it number one so i decided to try one for myself i have owned grill brushes from home depot online catalog sellers etceteras the bristles regardless of material on these brushes end up shedding over time or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless the grill wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad the pad works great i'm still on my first pad and have used it probably 10 times or more already it 's a good product and i highly recommend it	21
0	this grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear able the drawstring at it 's base is very easily prone to breaking i have bought and had to return this product twice already save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use	21
1	i love this clock i won it as an incentive through my creative memories sales i love that it is always set to the accurate time my 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently \( they always double check outside \) it 's been a great addition to our home	21
0	had for not even a month and when used it broke would not recommend	21
1	this is a nice rotisserie it could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks \( and shrinks in the process \) you will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets	21
1	this bbq tool set is absolutely the top of the line and worth much more than i paid for it ! all the tools are heavy wood with rubber grips and heavy stainless steel even the case is made to hold up for a long time i was truly impressed when i received it	21
1	when i decided to purchase a weber kettle i knew that a side table was required several reviews have spoken about the table splitting i ordered mine from my local hardware store and when i picked it up i asked about finishing it the hardware folks \( and this is a really good store \) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table bottom line take some time and finish this product your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily	21
0	item was not new and arrived with dents scratches gouges and jammed doors returne	21
0	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
1	the drawback is you ca n't grill at the same time you use the rotisserie but it works wonderfully ! delicious	21
1	i love it ! it 's a bit of work to maintain but it 's an awesome grill that cooks everything \( once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book \) i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it 's a at a quarter tank it 's worth the price	21
1	the hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself it 's very sturdy and comfortable even with two adults the quality of hammock is good and worth the price especially compared to other models we looked at	21
1	amazon service and weber quality my grill is up for another 15 years of great grilling	21
1	this is the most awesome wonderful fantastic grill there is out there everyone knows charcol ca n't be beat for flavor but it 's a bummer to get started weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill it is super easy to start the coals easy to keep clean and looking fabulous easy to empty the ashes and easy move around the deck \( out of our frequent seattle rain \) and of course the food we grill comes out delectable i am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method a snap with this grill ! it is well worth the price we love it ! !	21
1	we did have one of these items before and ours was just at the end of it 's life so the only place we ould find another one was through weber we love it	21
1	the grill wizard grill cleaning brush does the job of cleaning the grill better than any brush i 've ever used very little muscle is required to clean the grill especially if you clean after you cook and when the grill is still warm	21
1	its excellent but with black paintings it doesnt reflect too much i recommend i	21
1	i purchased this smoker last summer the assembly was simple one piece of hardware was missing but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place i replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat i desire it is sensitive to wind though	21
0	this item came to me and as much as i tried the only way i could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down there was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that i could read it from my bed i tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that did n't work either it seemed to me the guts of the unit were placed in wrong and there is only one way to move the projector so i cannot recommend this item i sent it back	21
1	it is a great product for the price the prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels it was easy to put together too	21
0	this product was purchased as a christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised the projection light only was operational when touched perhaps this was defective i have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund	21
1	in using this product i actually did find a mouse later in the kitchen caught by a trap this product should be used in coordination with other devices to kill rodents and not depend on it alone	21
1	i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews it did the job i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual	21
1	i have had this for 1 month now and i love it it does record the outdoor and indoor temp you can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock we had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night \( also great ! \) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time it is updated every 24 hours i love it	21
0	i was disappointed with these tongs which was surprising since oxo makes good kitchen utensils i agree with other reviewers it is difficult to grasp and close them unless you have a rather large hand \( which i do n't \) you 're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel ! when comparing these to my 12 tongs my hand grasp was at the same point which really made these 16 tongs no different from the 12 ones	21
1	when the time zone change happened earlier this year the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock the outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings however i would never ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it 's cloudy or sunny it 's often wrong i also like the light projected readings of the clock it 's too bad that you ca n't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which i prefer sometimes over the projection	21
1	timely arrival easy to use just the right size for my 10 year old daughter the only suggetion i would offer is to have plain brown packaging this was a christmas gift and arrived on our doorstep the box made it very obvious what was inside	21
0	the product was as advertised easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since i installed it so far it does not appear to have affected the mole population however to be fair it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device \( instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil although the critters have dug quite close to it \) to be really bend over backwards fair i suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles although the telltale signs are exactly what i understand mole tunnels to look like	21
1	i gave it to someone as a gift and they loved it great shipping too	21
0	this unit will be lucky to be within 15 deg of actual out side temp after several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different sending unit which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit i would not recommend this unit to anyone	21
1	these herbs are too young to taste yet but they are coming along ! i previously grew the salad greens which thrived but were n't as handy as having fresh herbs growing especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store i am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis	21
1	i'm so excited to use this table the weather has been rainy ever since i got it it assembled beautifully comes w it 's own little tool it 's a nice strong sturdy table but it 's not overly heavy i was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w o any help it 's going to get a lot of use this summer	21
1	the item is great quality and will last for a long time does exactly what i intended it to do	21
1	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21
1	we gave these out for halloween treats at the lake this weekend they were a big hit ! ! ! who does n't like glow sticks huh \? shipping was 6 99 for me so they were about 11 cents each great deal ! we were short 5 7 connectors for each 100 bracelets but perhaps we dropped them there were a lot of beverages involved \)	21
1	accurate easy to program and good to look at well worth the spent	21
1	excellent quality functional and flexible extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned the rubber grip was a nice touch and the replaceable brush heads are unique this comes with 3 brush heads and after those are used up you can get them for under 2 00 each this is a very solid well built tool that is built to last i highly recommend this	21
1	this is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings plus all the attachments make cleaning very versatile i looked at a similar system listed in the frontgate catalog and almost purchased it for more than 120 00 then i found this for less than 40 00 it 's great and i recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb dust free	21
0	these devices tested by the fda decades ago \( including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches \) do not work there have been a number of class action lawsuits against the companies that sell these they simply do n't and ca n't work against insects or rodents it 's science	21
1	i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock	21
1	got this on ebay for 150 00 it was barely used give me a high five	21
1	i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he was able to set it up right away it was easy to set up and it is easy to use	21
1	the hammock is fine particularly for the great price unfortunately my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock which is a pain to get off not the hammock 's fault i guess it just was n't such a good idea	21
1	this is a product i was not sure about just from seeing the picture once it arrived i was very pleased with my choice the picture does n't do it justice it is very sturdy and the rubber grip helps too ! ! ! great gift for a man or woman that loves to grill	21
1	the firepit was exactly as described and of good quality arrived faster than promised a quality item to get and enjoy an evening with the family roasting marshmellows	21
1	this thing catches mosquitos ! it 's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane it was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does	21
1	very stylish i bought two one for the office and one for home no problems with either of them but i have not checked to see how accurate they are	21
1	we are growing this in arizona and having a fair amount of luck so far the plants are thriving well it helped to start them in peat pots the soil here is clay so after they had their second leaves we transplanted them into the garden for our first time they have n't been much trouble yet easy seeds to grow	21
1	i'm not sure quite what to say about the burners as expected they work extremely well and they were rather easy to install the only problem i had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off beyond that i had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box	21
1	brush works well and is large enough to keep you from burning your hands metal attachment is perfect size for cleaning weber grates you ca n't go wrong with this product at the amazon price	21
1	i bought this after calling weber to find out if it would actually fit my summit gold c4 it does and that is what mattered to me i ca n't comment on durability as i just got it but it does feel heavy enough to withstand a beating	21
1	using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill 1 \) an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank 2 \) the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank it does n't look like it is included as offered the quick connect adapter by itself wo n't do you any good	21
0	a pretty simple device not really a waterfall concept of any kind the water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc nothing runs down the chain i suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow it 's mostly an asthetic piece	21
1	the ring and motor do what they are supposed to do the ring did not fit very well at first it was able to rock back and forth however after a little bending into shape it fit more snug the way the ring rests on the kettle there will alway be some gap which does not allow for a good seal i not only use this as a rotisserie but also to give me more room for beer can chicken its worth getting it for the added flexibility	21
1	great value look fantastic on the chairs excellent price could n't be happier	21
0	i bought this in january and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around now it is an hour off \( one hour less than it should be \) and wo n't reset to daylight savings time there is a button that resets it if you do n't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall no reply from the manufacturer beautiful clock but useless half the year	21
0	these mitts are good quality problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy	21
1	nice fabric and construction backordered item came 3 weeks before expected fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website but that ca n't always be helped	21
1	i have used medium sized kongs as abreakfast lunch dinner bucket for ourbichon for over five years i stuff it witha dried liver treat a combination ofeukanuba and max and a medium dog bone his five to eight trips a day for kongrefills provides a break from my sedentaryhome office activities recently i hadcollapsed lung surgery and now usethe filling of kongs for a six minutetreadmill break he now joins me on thetreadmill for about the first three minutesbefore jumping off to work on his latestkong kongs are a lasting feature in our lives the amazon provider of a two years supplyof kongs \( 6 \) was excellent and very competitivelypriced i recommend both the kong and supplierat a 5 star level	21
1	i purchased my oregon scientific station 8 years ago the internal sensor batteries need changed annually and i 've changed the rechargeables outside once i live in georgia and we get lots of sun other than needing to reset the unit about every 6 months \( gets confused by near lightning strikes but then what wireless electronics do n't \? \) and perhaps not the high precision rain gauge i 'd like to have it 's more than adequate for any home weather enthusiast	21
1	i had one of these when they first came out and loved it this one is even better i would say it 's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare since purchasing this item i once again have the perfect steak i am so glad i found this fork again i am one happy person	21
1	with new stainless flavorizer bars and new stainless steel cooking grates i plan on many more years of use for this grill my only wish is that they were a little cheaper on amazon price did n't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
1	while we 've used coleman folding stoves for years if you have trunk space there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill the small tank makes this practical for camping if you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available this is a great choice for camping equipment we still like the coleman for boiling water but i love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	21
0	hard to set up and use no directions and ca n't find anything on the web would not buy if i knew this	21
1	there are probably more authentic ways to make real bbq but nothing any easier if what you like about bbq is the flavor not the work this unit is for you add water to the pan chips to holder put some dry rubbed pork on one \( or all \) of the four grates light the gas and you are good to go it holds temperature very well unattended adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want your friends will think you are a genius	21
0	outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof instructions state the remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry shaded area the battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit hard to see how they call it an outdoor remote	21
1	this is a great item my three kids love watching the temp change as well as the highs and lows their friends have also commented on it when they visit we liked it so much that we just got it for some friends moving to hong kong where the highs will be high in the summer !	21
1	the new burner 's work great good as new ! only problem was removing old burners the screws that hold the ends in place were rusted in place i had to drill them out and replace the screws but all fine now much cheaper than buying new grill	21
0	sorry to say this is not good for pets like it says my poor two cats as soon as i plugged them in they went running to a room that did not have them and would not come out please do not get if you have cats	21
1	i have 2 indoor stations in different rooms in my house operating from just 1 outdoor sensor about 60 feet from my house and they work very well and the tempt they show is always the same as my mercury thermometer which is always right on robert johnson lewistown p	21
0	i purchased a 40 wt stinger insect killer from home depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months since it was near the end of the season i decided to store it and replace the bulb when i put it out in the spring the bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently insects also clogged it after a couple of days i gave up on it and recently purchased a flowtron bk 40 and it works great do n't waste your money buy a flowtron instead \( my last flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb \)	21
1	fast and good product	21
1	the best thing about this grill is that it has two swing up surfaces for holding your platters or foods to be prepared a great work surface easy cleaning and no cold spots within the cook area make this top of the line looks great too	21
0	the tongs where hard to grip so what i did to avoid sending them back i took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward like a claw now they are excellent grip great love the long handle and heavy duty soft rubber hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back	21
1	this cushion is extra long and extra thick and should work with most any chaise lounge it has really firm support not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season i highly recommend it	21
1	i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	21
0	it does not like rapid changes in temperature when the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back all of that is moot because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors though it is a mere 45 degrees outside sent it back	21
1	i gave it as a gift to my son and he likes it	21
1	this is truely a must have the flat non stick skewers holds everything in place they wo n't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for 7 39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for 5 99 a set i ordered 5 sets ! ! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food get yours today do n't wait get at least 2 sets	21
1	protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time this is by far the best grill cover we have had it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s 320 perfectly and it is heavyweight recommended definitely	21
1	this cooking utensil is unlike any other its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well say for example that your meat is not turning out well at all infact it does n't seem to look like meat anymore just crap well with this fork you can whack the meat stab it and then hurl it across the yard and trust me you 'll feel much better	21
0	i ordered this piece and the matching chairs i have waited since july for them to be available they became availabe in september so i ordered them they kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs said they could n't get them so i had to cancel the sofa as well now i am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue ! !	21
1	absolute must have for a golfer ! ! awesome gift ! ! grips are actual golf club grips not cheap imitation the golf ball corn on the cob skewrs are a bonus ! ! the bag and the cover make this set a conversation item not an eye sore	21
1	this wood chip soaker actually does what it is supposed to do smart design no instructions needed compact well made likely to be long lived	21
1	in considering that i purchased this item for my bedroom i would have to say that it is perfect for aesthetic reasons i preferred an analog wall clock but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until i found this item by lacrosse it could not be anymore perfect as its looks price and self \( time \) adjusting qualities has made this an m f \( major find \) now i can sleep through the daylight savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock but whether or not i will be an hour early or late to work	21
0	very disappointed purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the spring and summer time well i think these units invite the ants in we 've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room etc these devices do not phase them at all they continue to parade right by	21
1	i am using the product for my charbroil grill caddy it is a decent fit however with the colder weather the material has become more stiff we 'll have to see how it weathers over the cold months	21
1	it 's easy to carry every where we g	21
1	we bought this clock to use indoors living in florida our power service is n't always reliable especially during hurricane season so having a battery operated atomic clock is perfect for us ! when folks visit they always comment on how nice the clock looks the bronze finish is muted and it does n't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures and for 45 and no shipping we could n't beat the price on ebay overstock com or any onther online companies in other words we 're very pleased with our purchase	21
1	received this item and its great ! ! i have this under a gazebo and wanted an asian modern look with straight lines this was perfect the type of wicker \( actually plastic \) is very durable the cushions are thick and actually solid some are real soft \( cheap \) these are not this chair is really wide and sits low to the ground i could not have asked for better i bought the whole set and everything is great email me with any questions chris schaffner gmail com orange county c	21

1	i love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it 's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill it 's great we use it on our patio all the time the build quality is great and it 's very easy to cleani think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere	21
1	the fabric is very strong and nicer looking than the usual black covers very attractive on the deck	21
1	good product in general one came a bit bent and the clever automatic lock unlock would n't work until i unbent it i ordered 3 was billed for three and received 2 amazon is now junk in my inbox	21
1	highly recommed this grill cover the appearance style is classy with it 's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio and it is sooo durable ! i'm sure it will last for years no more ugly black vinyl covers that you punch holes in the first time you try to drape them over the grill i 'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now ! !	21
0	i bought one of the custom tile 7 's \( loaded with options \) from california and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self destruct i tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years until they skipped to mexico tiles just did n't fall off they spalted the fire box broke etc when it got too bad to use and look at we had to throw it away a 1500 mistake if there was a really good ceramic cooker out there i would try it again they cook like a dream	21
1	i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	21
1	set up easily stores easily transports easily for grilled meals for two skewered food sausages steaks burgers fish corn on the cob it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big bbq the folding legs keep the direct heat off any surface underneath with this efficient little griller we 're enjoying patio cook outs much more frequently than before	21
1	buy this little fun toy clock it 's a blast in the bedroom just look up and you know the time i love it ! cute little thing the front panel is worthless \( to see \) but who needs it	21
1	i got this hammock back in november so i do n't know if this hammock will be good for summer but it is the perfect hammock for winter ! my fiance and i could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter it is very comfortable even with 2 people on it the surface seems to be semi water resistance we left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface we just turn the hammock dump out the water and it dried under the sun in a few hours i read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time but i can live with it	21
1	it 's funny how the guys coming to the bbq all comment and check out this grill	21
0	after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	21
1	have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home these are easy to set up easy to read and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the atomic function \( self setting \) is wonderful earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries ! also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they 're just as nice	21
1	you 'll need a large throw pillow for a back cushion 20 at least also the chair is fairly low seat cushion is okay about the same quality as target or home depot construction is plastic wicker over a steel frame so i suspect some rusting over the years overall a very nice chair at a decent price point if you want a nice patio chair cover that fits fairly well check out veranda patio chair cover 78932 on amazon \( 19 each \) the cover is heavy duty and is waterproof	21
0	essentially a one season lightweight hibachi that does n't stand up to extended use so at 12 it 's too expensive but may be worth about 5	21
1	i have n't tried this item yet as the weather has n't cooperated but the service was great i ordered it as a last minute christmas item and got it in time to make my recepient happy thank	21
1	first i would like to say with a bit of trial and error this is a very good product well worth the price i want to comment on the great technical support from la crosse and the super customer support from amazon the first unit i received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong left la crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours tried to trouble shoot to no avail la crosse followed up next day e mailed amazon about issue replacement was in mail the next day outstanding	21
0	these lights do n't hold a charge i called the manufacturer and they said that these are summer spring lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work the ad on amazon did not say that i even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge \( 1 2 hours \) they are also very dim lights do n't waste your money	21
1	we bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale after longing for the full priced versions at stores we love these chairs but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them one of the chairs broke recently b c of the cords fraying over time the good news is that i easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for lafuma replacement cords and for 19 i will have a like new chair again \( rather than replacing the chair for 150 \) so for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording worry no more	21
1	i bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire this fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year half way through burning it ! now for the unit it arrived nicely packed with all parts installation was a snap about 15 minutes there were dents in the screen which is obviously part of the packing process they are so small though that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them the removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going be sure to use mitts or tongs however or you will get burned	21
1	you ca n't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it ! the cover is a high quality perfect fit product \( odd shape and all \) that looks great and fully protects the grill i highly recommend it gt	21
1	cheap and it works is really an understatement ! item is quality made just plug in and empty drawer every day or so no bait or bags to buy i ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead mosquitos in the drawer i highly recommend this item	21
1	i found the 16 lacrosse atomic clock to be exactly as described the metal case is sturdy and good looking the directions very straight forward 16 is big be sure you want this diameter they make smaller units i am quite satisfied with my purchase	21
1	these are very nice quality and comfortable everything was as expected and came in just a few days	21
1	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
1	i love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price the battery lasts forever so it 's portable the time sets itself atomically it shows the temperature has the obligatory annoying alarm clock the time lights up on the ceiling and it looks good to boot very well made and highly recommended oregon scientific rocks	21
1	i did buy this grill in a store and now that i search amazon for acessories i find that it is a lot cheaper here it is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking many parts are not as sturdy corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as i would expect	21
1	exactly what i was looking for very heavy duty and the fit was perfect	21
1	this canvass like cover is very sturdy and i think it will stand the test of time a friend of mine saw it and i ordered one for her too ajustable size makes it a fit for several sizes of firepits	21
1	i have always wanted a turkey fryer but they was to spendy and at this price i had to get it although i was a litte reluctant buying it off the internet then i received it not only was i happy with it i was also relieved that i didnt get ripped off with another internet scam \( thats why i ordered through amazon so i would be safe from fraud \) anyway i havent yet fried my turkey but i know that they will taste great ! ! ! ! !	21
1	we bought our performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store it was the best purchase we ever made ! its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition about 15 20 minutes you 're ready to grill for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal its a piece of cake \( we had our reservations too ! \) and you 're going to wish you switched sooner food never tasted so good	21
0	i bought this product no long ago it never works mice still jump around and even make noise i call the company they do n't have technical report the product manual says once mice get used to the ultrasound it will not work i never heard about this from other company this company is very bad	21
0	i have to agree with the bad reviews i used this smoker 6 times and the element burned out of course a replacement was 40 00 i purchased it new on sale for 65 00 it is now a charcoal smoker unless you have money to burn ! i would not recomend this item	21
1	heavy duty and sturdy cover attachment to wheel to keep from blowing away in wind is great vent pockets and storage pocket also very handy	21
1	this is by far the best grill accessory i have every gotten it cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender i have n't tried cooking anything else but i'm sure whatever it was it would come out great i would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill	21
1	i love my stack able planter it 's very neat clean and even accommodates my amaryllis bulbs in the center i anticipate no problems bringing my plants indoors this winter either	21
1	i bought this grill for my husband as a christamas gift he said that it is awesome he says you can walk away and not worry about anything burning also he says that it heats the food evenly the warming rack is a great asset too finally what he likes most is that you can control the temperature for each side wow what a awesome product	21
1	i purchased this product mainly for steaming blue crabs which throughout the summer we trap in the river in front of our house for years i have steamed them in a pot on the stove and the steam and odor filled the house using this pot outside provided a welcome relief with the added benefit of being much easier to clean than the enamel steamer i used on the stove it is very easy to use and it is just the right size for an average haul of crabs i have never fried a turkey but i just might try it	21
0	the name on this item should be pillow it is much too small for a cushion they need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head i wish i had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before i ordered it lesson learned	21
1	the off color did n't bother me i expected that after reading all the reviews i agree it could have been about 6 lower to the ground however there was a 3 flaw in the stitching of one seam a bead of duco cement sealed that up and it will never be seen on the back side of the grill the heavy duty material looks like it stand the test of time and weather	21

1	i bought these because i'm always burning my arms when i remove bread from my oven these gloves cover my arms to the elbow and are flexible enough to allow me to handle bread pans easily the price is outstanding i saw the same thing at one of the chain home stores for 7 99 each	21

1	for the money 10 99 i wish i had bought another set now that i see the price has risen these are heavy and they stay in the ground where put i have had no problem whatsoever with them coming up due to pressure from the hose my hose is very long ultra heavy and thick and the guides keep the hose from going into my plants at the corners they are also very good looking and are a complement to the yard now that the price lowered to 9 99 i bought three more in december 2006 the new ones have the same quality as the earlier one	21
0	the spring on these tongs broke on first use in september 2006 this renders them largely useless i purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired despite this assurance i am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective i returned them and i cannot recommend these tongs	21
